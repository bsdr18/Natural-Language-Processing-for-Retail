1. Oldest 360 will not play it - after unplugging internet and no account logged in I finally made it through the first disk install after 5 tries of install = ""Your data is corrupt"", delete and try again. After getting it installed it is unplayable due to the choppy sound cutting in and out - you could play it silent but the sound cutting in/out is unbearable. Awaiting a downloaded patch hopefully.

2. Middle 360 (R2D2) installed first try (after unplug and logout) but music is also choppy SFX are Ok but without music it's dead to play. Also awaiting patch.

3. New 360 - unplug/logout installed first try and plays beautifully - not a glitch or problem with sight/sound. Mature son is playing it and loves the game.

So - I would advise against the buggy 360 version for now - at least until WBros has a patch and you can install the game without having to unplug Internet. (You can plug it back in afterwards and login to Xbox Live to play - provided you have newer Xbox 360).

No internet connection, no online authentication, no proprietary game launchers. Just the game you bought and you. Bought this game for my wife and it is a damn nightmare to get it up and running. So many problems, I couldn't believe it. Let me break it down.

1. You need to set up an Origin account. This one isn't the worst, but I find it annoying that I need to create an EA login and password just to play a game I bought. I don't plan on using Origin for anything else, so this is definitely an inconvenience.

2. Origin constantly crashes. I tried installing this on my wife's computer, which is windows 10. Origin would crash a few seconds after launching so I tried a few things - restarted the PC, checked for any updates, checked drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled Origin. Nothing worked. Tried googling the problem and it seems to be a common occurrence - Origin does not play nice with windows 10. So I tried launching Origin through compatibility modes for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. None of them were stable. They all crashed. Great. I then tried installing it on MY laptop, which is still windows 7 by default and after a few brief crashes, it finally loaded the store and let me type in the product code. THANK GOODNESS.

3. There is no way to install from the DVD that came with the game. When you insert the disc, an autolaunch window pops up telling you to install Origin, set up EA account, and then install Sims 4. Ok. I did the first two things....let me install Sims 4. But it won't. There are no options. If you click continue, it will just try to install Origin again. So you close it, pop the disc out, pop it in....and it loops the same prompts. Install Origin, Set up account...I GET IT. I already did those things. SO...I look through my Origin launcher for options. Nothing about installing from disc, only lets you download. Great. Now I gotta wait HOURS for this thing to download 10 gigs of data so I can play the game I ALREADY BOUGHT AND HAVE A DVD INSTALL DISC FOR. What a waste of time.

This is now a NEGATIVE 5 star review!
I thought that, ""Hey... It's been over half a year since I last played this game... Maybe, just maybe... Blizzard fixed the stupid Skirmish A.I. and the game might be fun now..."" Boy was I wrong, as I cannot even play the game anymore because of blizzard treating its paying customers as if they were criminals. They might as well ask for a fingerprint and D.N.A. sample before being able to play. Maybe I need to take a test of some sort before they deem me worthy to play a game I PHYSICALLY OWN! Hell the C.I.A. and F.B.I. websites have less log-in requirements than this freaking game.

I have to REMOVE ALL STARS because this game is no longer playable due to the sheer amount of loops needed to jump through just to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!!! There is nothing wrong with my FIOS fiber-optic connection! There is nothing wrong with my firewall! There is no reason to have to activate a game (for the sixth time!!) I LEGALLY OWN AND HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY OF IN THE DRIVE! It tells me I need to link my game to the battle.net account but doesn't give me a link or any decent information as to HOW TO DO THIS! I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AT ALL IN ANY MODE!! I cannot even log onto the game as a GUEST on my own computer! I DON'T EVEN PLAY MULTI-PLAYER!! Why the bleep do I need to log onto 3 different places to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!?!? This is beyond ridiculous!

If this is their idea to try and stop piracy, then they failed, because this kind of treatment of PAYING CUSTOMERS just drives PC piracy through the roof.

If there is any class action lawsuit against blizzard, or way to return the game, please let me know because I want my $60+ dollars back!!!
!!EDIT #3!!

I just got the retail release... Been waiting 10 years for this... I have to say it is more hype than it delivers on. Yes the controls are still nice and simple, I enjoy that a lot... But it just seems to be Starcraft 1 minus the brood war expansion, with a bit better graphics thrown in. Forgive me for being blunt and critical with this but THEY HAVE HAD OVER 10 YEARS TO MAKE THIS GAME!!!

First off the price was outrageous, but like an idiot fanboy I shelled out $60 bucks for 1/3rd of a game... Considering that this is only the Terran campaign and that the Protoss and Zerg campaigns will not come out for over a year from now, and they will cost an additional $60 each, as far as I know at the moment! Though there are rumors they may be expansion priced at $20 a pop (in all honesty they should be FREE Down-Loadable-Content since it should have been in the game from the beginning!). So Blizzard is becoming even more greedy than EA. Sure when EA releases a game it's too soon, half-a$$ and buggy as all hell, but at least it is mostly there. Blizzard, on the other hand releases a game, a million years after the first game, fully polished and de-bugged, but missing 2/3rds of the gameplay and no big improvements over the original!

The game runs fine on ultra settings for me with vista ultimate x64, 8gigs of ram, and an Nvidia 9800gtx+ card, but I am a bit disappointed considering there has been over 10 YEARS of 3D RTS advancement from the original Starcraft... What I mean is: You CANNOT rotate the camera, only zoom in and out a little bit so sometimes trying to click on one unit in a group of many is a nightmare. You CANNOT rotate the placement of buildings so everything is always facing only one direction, not that bad but units still come out of the sides or backs of buildings through walls instead of the front door... The is NO anti-aliasing support, not that bad, but my computer is a gaming rig. So compared to the older Command & Conquer Generals, or the newer Command and Conquer 3, or Supreme Commander and many other RTS games out there already; this game is actually BEHIND the times in graphics and 3D battlefield control.

One of the worst things is the online requirement... But fortunately it is only checked occasionally so this can still be played offline with a laptop, but in that case you have to log on as a ""GUEST"" for a game YOU OWN on a computer YOU OWN! But BEWARE, when you register the game they ask you VERY PERSONAL THINGS, like: name, age, sex, location, telephone number, and even your street address! And you HAVE to fill it out or else you cannot play the game!

Now for the gameplay... It is just as awesome as the first Starcraft! I am having a blast with it... But that is because this is JUST LIKE the first Starcraft, some of the levels feel like they just took them from the first game and threw in more eye-candy. If you LOVED BASE BUILDING then keep playing the original Starcraft, because this game seems to have been made for the A.D.H.D. And A.D.D. generation, too many levels are small and set with a TIME LIMIT... Come-on Blizzard! You can do better than tiny little 10 minute levels... Though there are still some large maps and unlimited time levels for us base builders. But I miss the huge levels from Broodwar and the original Starcraft where you would have to send out search patrols all over the map to find that last enemy building or objective. I think they spent more time on the cut scenes and in-between game down time than the level design and map sizes, some of the levels feel downright cramped claustrophobic. There are some new, and quite AWESOME units in this game, but there are also lots of missing favorites from the Broodwar expansion. Though one of the new elements I find interesting is the downtime between missions where you can purchase unit upgrades, talk with crew members ""Point and click"" style, and choose the next missions a bit less linear than the first Starcraft, so it has a bit of RPG elements thrown in. They have also jumped onto the whole ""Achievements"" bandwagon so you get these annoying popups now and then that apparently give you bragging rights online or something like that. When you get these achievements, they don't actually do anything that I am aware of in the game other than unlocking portrait pictures for the forums online community.

This game gets 5 STARS for fun because it is just as fun as the first Starcraft, but... It only gets 2 STARS overall for the fact that in over 10 years they could only give us 26 missions in ONE PLAYABLE CAMPAIGN, and slightly updated game-play graphics (one of my friends couldn't tell the difference between the original Starcraft and this one), while taking away LAN play, taking away some favorite units, and jumping on the ""ALWAYS ONLINE"" and pointless achievements intrusive bandwagon.

I loved the original Starcraft to death, so I honestly thought this one would be a bit more updated compared to the original. It is still a very fun game, but I would say... Wait a few more years for a game of the year edition, or a reduced price box-set with everything included, unless Blizzard nickel and dimes its fans to death first.

*edit #2*
Player vs. A.I. is completely messed up, the A.I. does not even make base defenses until 30 minutes into a match and even then it makes only 3 and in a weird place. A.I. also attacks the entry to your base that is nearest to the A.I. base and completely ignores undefended points of your base if they are farther than your main entry point. A.I. also just creates a large mass of units and sends them all at once making the A.I. very easy to defeat with even bad units. Multi-player and VS. A.I. has a lack of unit types, basically half of what you got in the campaign. Every day I play this, it feels more like a still in development beta release.

I will continue to update this review as things get worse or better over time.

Only the larger protector allows transmission of touch signals from stylus (ie when the smaller protector is on the lower screen and you touch it, nothing happens). Keep in mind that the large protector is for the top screen WHERE YOU DO NO TOUCHING. The smaller protector, where all the touching occurs, inhibits the stylus completely.

The work around is to use the smaller protector for the top (not a huge deal) and then TRIM the larger protector to fit the bottom screen. As you can imagine even careful cutting is not as good as a factory edge. Also cutting introduces particulates which create bubbles.

I don't go out and buy the next installment of FF (after VIII, it really got bad imo), I enjoyed .hack and its storyline though (but I felt that the series could have been brought together into one large game like with FFVII). Then there is the PE video game, I loved the first one, had some trouble, but over all it was a great game. I knew there was a part 2, so I found a copy and started playing it. Boy...was I disappointed.

 First, the game play is terrible, the movement is haphazard, the angles are horrific, and its down right troublesome (unlike the first one). I loathed the movement, there was none of the smoothness of the first one.

 Second, I hated the leveling, what leveling there is. You don't go up in your hit points, you barely go up in MPs and parasite powers, and even worse, when you go to a next scene (from one point to the next in the story) you go back down to your 100 hit points.

 Third, which is related to the angles, the combat is atrocious. There is nothing quick and exciting, in fact its down right stressful because (since you rarely have a chance to get items for health unless you spend ""money"" between the scenes at home base) you end up dying again and again until low and behold you get through with maybe 1 hit point left and then WHAM you are hit by another attack and you have to do the whole stupid thing over again. Even worse, the camera angles are so bad you rarely if ever see the enemies and just shoot blindly.

 Fourth, connected to three, the weapons are horrible to use. You end up getting killed repeatedly because you have to jerkingly reload so many times that when you are facing multiple opponents (unlike the smoothness of the original first story) and you're going to get killed unless you spend hours dealing with one combat situation.

 Fifth, items, with the original first game, you got lots and lots of items. With this game, you are in luck if after three or four attacks (bringing you down to 1 hit point) you finally strike it and get a recovery2 pill that brings you back up to original hit points but then again those hit points are taken down again by the end of the next combat round.

 While the story line might be interesting, it fails in comparison to the first one and by all means, the poorness of this game in the controlling just makes you so fed up that you don't care how this story ends. Its a bad, bad game that could have been a great sequel if only the company had followed the original game's beauty. Dont buy this game unless you have lots of headache medicine.

1.0,False,"07 8, 2012",A3TVW39631ZKKU,B00178630A,Kastoremaru,"I played this game for close to 200 hours in a failed attempt to get some fun out of it.  Yes, you're going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it, but no I didn't.  I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive.  700 days played in World of Warcraft.  Thousands of hours played in D2.  Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.

I believed in Blizzard Entertainment.  I really, really did.  From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.  Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story.  Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot.  Sounds pretty stupid right?  It is trust me.  What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share?  You get nothing.  Fun huh?  So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money.  This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level.  Pure fail Blizzard!  Pure fail!

Then there are issues with the game's difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom.  They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died.  They said the game was crap and quit.  The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through.  So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die.  If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.

Last point I want to touch on is that the game's end game is nonexistent.  As in it's hard not because it's fun, but because it cheeses you into death.  I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear.  Then you can last for 3 hits!  So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house.  So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs.  You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear.  Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold.  The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money.  So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person.  But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over.  Sounds like fun huh?  Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun?

I also want to mention that the game lags like no other.  Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs, invisible attacks, melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen, etc.  And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it's gear.  That makes the game even more fun with lag!

Game is terrible.  Leave it in the store.  Do not buy.  It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno.  The story is terrible.  The gear drops don't exist for you.  The auction house is the best place to level up.  And the real money auction house has the best gear.

The first three for the original PS and Enter the Dragonfly as well as A Hero's Tail.  I found that I loved these games until Insomniac quit being involved in making them and Universal/Vivendi took over.  A Hero's Tail was better than Enter the Dragonfly which had so many bugs and not enough of the subworlds I was accustomed to.
I bought this game figuring maybe, just maybe Universal had listened to the customer's who said they miss the Spyro from the original games but no, they didn't listen.
This game is the polar opposite of the Spyro games for PS in that all you do is walk a little, kill some enemies, walk a little more and.... you guessed it kill some enemies.  There's no collecting of items just fighting.  If I wanted a game that only involved fighting I'd buy Mortal Kombat (which I loved back in the day).  This game was so boring and disappointing I didn't finish it.  It was a waste of my money and I'd sell it but I do not want to torture anyone with a game this boring.  If you like fighting games then this is for you but if you've been a fan of the Spyro series from the beginning you're probably going to say the same thing I did and that is that this game stinks.

Crysis original does not have 5 activations on their DRM, but was lacking in gameplay. It had some really awesome moments and was just waiting for an expansion pack to come and better it.

Crysis warhead had intense action in awesome environments coupled with highly detailed levels and more character personality, but it also has the nasty draconian DRM known as securom. This means that you cannot resell the game when you're done, nor can you buy one copy and play LAN games. If you have a little brother that wants to join you, or a dad and brother, expect to pay full price per seat.

If you're creative and have trustworthy friends, you can lend crysis warhead to a friend just fine, which is how I played it. There are many less breathtaking moments, and stealth is no longer your priority, but you can't just blindly shoot places up.

Unfortunately, because of piracy IN RESPONSE TO the anti-piracy/DRM measures, crytek has decided to compromise the quality and integrity of their games and work on porting their next crysis/cryengine games to console. The difference is immense, and Crysis is as good as it will get for PC gamers as far as utilizing system resources for at least another 6 months.

Pros:
-Very awesome physics
-Very awesome graphics that make console graphics fanboys cry
-Some interesting gameplay dynamics
-For an FPS in this day and age, interesting AI

Cons:
-Downright nasty DRM measures on warhead and wars.
-Psuedo-open environments, you are on a linear path, always.
-Exploration is rarely rewarded when it can be done
-Developer has added injury to insult, and after alienating most of its PC customers claimed that the piracy is too much for them. Sales numbers at the time were 1.5 million copies sold, 350,000 copies downloaded. Sales numbers now are 4.5 million copies sold, 800,000 copies pirated.
-Sequels will be using console-ified graphics and gameplay that won't be worth your time. For now Crysis has an interesting storyline told wonderfully by the game engine, but this will change.

I wish I had researched it online first, because it totally destroyed my operating system twice.

After the first install, and attempt to run the program, Star Force popped up and said I had to install it to play the game. Next I had to reboot my PC. Okay, no problem so far. Next thing I know my computer crashes, goes into a DOS-like screen where Windows tells me it has to do a system repair. At first I thought this might have been a hiccup, but later I tried installing the game again and the exact same thing happened.

Next I tried it on my laptop, and while it didn't require a system repair, the program just wouldn't load (I'm running XP 32bit on both computers by the way).

As with many of these DRM programs, there seems to be a complete lack of ethics. I was not given the option to remove Star Force (it was never listed on either machine in Control Panel>Programs and Features). So I had to do a system restore on my laptop as well.

The game itself is great, I haven't played a wrestling game since the SNES days.
The game controls are great arcadey fun, and deep counter system is implemented well, and as well has a great roster of characters.
The main reason you should stay away from this game is the load times.
Upon starting the game it has a memory cache' that take 5-10 mins just to get to the main menu.
This happens every time you play the game. Lets say you play WWE All Stars, quit and watch a movie listen to music or do anything else and go back, the game will cache memory again. You will not be able to just quickly jump into a match to kill 10-15 minutes, it takes 10-15 minutes before you even see gameplay. Its to the point that you wouldn't even want to play it, because you can actually play another game in the time it takes to load WWE ALL STARS.
There are load times between just picking you character in various modes, a load time before and after the entrances. There are load times everywhere, the load times are ridiculous.
If you plan on playing the game with some buddies later, you will have to plan ahead like 30 mins before any of your friends come over. I cannot recommend the game. The loading times in this game is the worst I've ever seen in the current generation. The load times will bore you to tears. Also the developers won't allow you to even install the game to cut down on the loading times via patch or update. I even wrote to THQ on whether or not they are working on it, and they say its by-design. By-design means they released a game that cannot be fixed. You will spend more time watching a loading screen than actually playing. You controller will go to sleep and disconnect because of the loading times. I have other fighting games MK9 SSF4 Tekken etc, with graphics just as good or better than WWE All Stars and those games loading times are nothing. You can almost play and beat arcade mode on SSF4 in the time WWE ALL Stars even gets you to the main menu. This is one of the most fustrating games I played this current gen, to a point where I will not ever buy a game from THQ ever again. This game need a warning label on the game stating: ""your enjoyment of this game will be severly affected by the by-design load times. THQ Releases games that are incomplete.""

The only enjoyment I really had with the game is Me and my buddies had a drinking game. You take a drink every time a load screen comes on and/or when a loading screen changes with in a loading screen.
You will be plastered by the time you get to the character select screen, because it loads when you move the cursor to pick a character as well.

However, my rating is for the ridiculous DOWNLOADING REQUIRED to play the game. Is Blizzard forcing people to DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE game all over again, despite the contents on the disc?! This single 8GB Dual Layer Disc that you get in the box is essentially USELESS.

One would think when you're buying a PHYSICAL DISC, you could start playing the game right away - saving bandwidth/time to install the game; as opposed to buying a DIGITAL CONTENT where you have to download the whole thing.

Blizzard now REQUIRES you to DOWNLOAD an entire whopping 15 GB file to start playing the game.

I played Starcraft 2 when it first came out, but years later today, I decided I wanted to play it again and reinstall the game on a new computer...

I can not believe the installation/update is going to take FOREVER having to download this ridiculous 15 GB file/practically the ENTIRE GAME. What is the point of having the DISC now? It is worthless.

No wonder the game is so cheap now... you are basically buying a CD-KEY and an INSTALLER software without the actual game contents.

- Mechanics - The basic mechanics of an FPS are simply not there. You have to dump an entire clip to kill an enemy, and the grenades don't even kill! They are like stun grenades that don't stun but rather just knock the enemy over! What's up with that??? Did someone really think this is ""fun""?
- Customization - Sure there are plenty of options but why bother? You can't even see yourself so it's a big waste of time and effort.
- XP/Leveling - In the 3 games I played, I earned 3,000+ XP and ranked amongst the top players (bots) in campaign mode. I then found that all these points really amount to very little reward. You get one or two more ""perks"" to purchase but most of what you earn are character customizations which I don't care about one bit!
- SMART system? Does it even exist? Never worked for me!
- Controls - Sluggish as heck, which is further highlighted by the need to traverse all the way back to the objective after you respawn at the ORIGINAL spawn point!
- AI - Very bad. In the very first mission one of the first objectives is to escort a friendly AI, who apparently enjoys walking blindly into a swarm of enemies! What's the deal??

This is on ""Superman 64"" levels of horrendous. Is it EXACTLY the same game as the 80's and 90's game, only with a generic piece of crap as the titular hero. Some lame Master Chief/Robocop ""darker"" and ""edgier"" hybrid. Plus, everything looks as generic 'futuristic and edgy' as possible. The worst kind of lame ""Judge Dredd"" type of marketing attempts to appeal to audiences possible.

The game has NO story, and actual seperate game modes just to switch the camera. The new camera is called ""First Person Bomber"" and you have to actually play it seperate from standard camera, aside from just switching a button or option in the menu. You have to exit the game you're playing just to SWITCH the camera! Oh, and you can't save. And this game was originally sold for $50 full price. Extra insulting that this wouldn't even be a good free DLC, yet they have to gall to trick people into spending money on this. THIS?!? This game literally isn't even worth it's price if it was free. They should have to pay you for the time, frustration, and insult to the franchise they've committed with this atrocity.

Even after 8 months, it's just not very fun. The plot sizes are WAY too small--nothing like previous games. You always end up feeling cramped within 15 minutes of starting. You can't put your city into sections like you used to be able to. They want you to use regions, but region play is really broken. Services don't get shared like they're supposed to (which is game-breaking, not an inconvenience). You can't lay down high-volume traffic roads. It would be so much more fun if it were offline and the plots were 4 to 8 times bigger. Then this game would be good. Seriously, the plots should be at least 4x, preferably 8x, bigger.

To add insult to injury, they're charging an arm and a leg for stupid DLC buildings rather than giving players what they actually want: offline and large plot sizes.

To their credit, they have made great strides in fixing traffic. This was huge. But it's not the only thing that was broken. The game needs a lot more work to be fun.

1.0,True,"06 19, 2012",A3ED0C1C84EOHM,B003P2VTBO,Bill,"I've played this game for a few weeks now hoping I was just missing something and it would get better. At first glance, it seems like a remarkably good 4X game, it has a diversity of races to play, a randomized tech tree, and interesting Homeworld style space battles. (Its from the same production team) The problem is, this game is very unsteady and doesn't obey the fundamental principles of 4X gaming. A 4X game should follow the rule that when you have more planets, more production, and more populace, you get more income, better research, and more ships. This game partially follows that rule, but there is a very fine line drawn because of the planet hazard when colonizing. You literally need to break down the risk/reward of colonizing different planets using X number of either destroyer or cruiser ships, vs the cost of owning those planets and the time it takes to get them up to speed and being productive. That might be interesting if they told you outright, but they don't, leaving you figuring it out by trial and error. Expand too much, and your economy shuts down as everything goes to planet upkeep, expand too slow, and you get outpaced by other players. Its really irritating.

The tech tree is interesting in being randomized, but it also means you don't know what technologies you can count on. Some are core and are always there, some are randomized. You might think cruiser class colony ships are core technology, since they allow you to expand to very hostile worlds very rapidly. They aren't, and if you focus your research toward getting them and find the tech isn't there, you end up pretty screwed. This is but one example of the difficulty in planning effective strategy. Lots of the techs are either very weak or outright useless, others are exceptionally powerful and very necessary. Again, much trial, error, and frustration in sorting out which is which.

The AI is my biggest issue, not just because it knows what its doing while your floundering around, but because it obviously gets a resource handicap on normal difficulty. I've played dozens of games now using different game variables using almost all of the different races. The results are almost always the same, I rank at the top in population and colonies, middle in income, and ALWAYS dead last in technology. I've even tried putting every cent into research as the Liir, the best researchers of the game, and I never budge off the bottom in tech. I'm constantly being outclassed in technology by races that have even half as many colonies as I do at all points in the game, its ridiculous. Playing the game on easy means you just plow right on over them, and easily wipe out their homeworld with your first attack fleet.

This game is probably alot more fun on multiplayer, but I've never been much of a multiplayer fan, except for much faster paced games. This game takes a really long time to learn and you'll probably be pretty irritated along each step of it. There are tons of minor details that take a long time to figure out and are pretty important, especially with the interface and gameplay.

1.0,True,"04 5, 2016",A1Z3O2SODQ1NZ1,B00CMQTTZ2,Jason,"Review is more of a 3.5 then a 1 but I had some fan boys freak out at me... So I'm just being stubborn. Also I still feel I'd wait till it's patched. I was under impressed by the lack of polish for a game that was delayed so many times.

The game feels like if infamous second son game play and the order 1886 made a baby. Yes I know those are both PlayStation exclusive in reference to a Xbox exclusive, but so it goes I own both systems.

As for the ""glitchy"" part of the game refer to the review below. But the games honestly better after it starts moving. The opening is by far the worse part visually and overall design considering it has AI partners act as your guides for the first chapter... Which is always boring and or overly controlled.  When the main dude is standing still the world looks amazing... The problem is when it moves. The game uses a forced pixel count to generate a higher looking resolution then it really has which causes ghosting. In combat I can barely notice since I'm jumping about so much, but in the slower parts it's way in your face with some people looking like flash going at 1 mile an hour. The game is definitely pushin the Xbox one further then it can handle while retaining a constant 30fps. Oddly cause of the technique they use to make it look better it causes it to look worse in the frame rate department.

The story is ok... I wouldn't say it's bad or good. Doesn't make me think about time travel in any impressive way like steins gate (ps vita exclusive) or make me care for the characters in any special way. The main character jack is as boring as they come, honestly the only interesting character is Paul the bad guy since he actually has motivation. Also the tv show that is said to follow the bad guys really follows some random people that get pulled into the resistance... So more mistaken good guys. No fun.

Combat is fun, doesn't feel like a button mess and with good timing combos of powers can be shot off quite fun. Most baddies can be dealt with any style. There are a few bosses though that only have one way to beat them and it takes away from the fun.

The other part of game play is playing the main bad guy and choosing how different situations are handled. The changes have been slight at best, more effecting the side stories of the tv show then the main game considering I been trying my hardest to make the main characters life difficult and nothing has changed.

Now the elephant in the room... The game has 20 minute tv episodes between each act. 4 total.  They are completely non active.  But slippable! And they aren't pinical to the story but give each section of game play a little more filler. The problem is how do you watch tv? I watch tv shows by putting on Netflix and then popping on my computer and surfing the web or playing games on my vita. I don't sit still and watch tv... So when my video game asks me to sit still and watch a show that's only semi entertaining I space out. When I go through the game again I'll probably just skip them. I will say one thing for them they are a true show of remedies talent for pacing. As soon as the drag of doing the same same comes over me, a episode starts and I go off to make food or if it's night time get ready for my night time internet searchings. Also just something annoying is the episodes are streamed so plan on some buffering or downloading the entire episodes catalog. 75gb.

GLITCHY PART: this is the one that annoyed me enough to originally give the game a 1 star. It's after Jake learns to hold a gun the first time and busts open a door to kill two guys just standing there in a lab. After that the brother  AI guide should put in his code to make it so the door can open. In my game he just stood there startled doing nothing. I tried to reload the check point and finally was forced to replay the whole chapter, watch all the boring videos again to simply get him to punch in his code. And yes fan boys there is a part that he is needed to open a door actually he's needed for most of them since if he can't make it to the door the open icon won't trigger. Trust me I replayed this part a good few times. Did it warrant a 1 star... For a AAA game I expected better. Reminded me of resident evil 6... That said after the brother is taken out of the picture with a gun to the head there aren't really any AI partners to be annoyed by and most door or sequence triggers work fine.

But, I'm aware a large number of people gave it Five Stars, so I'm forced to conclude that they either have some type of superhuman ability to cope with the funky controls, or they're masochists.

I waited literally years to play this game. The promotional videos looked incredible, and the prospect of encountering, and controlling, other Bounty Hunters was enough to make my mouth water. I bought the very first Metroid Prime back for the Game Cube, a game which was hard, but GOOD.  Metroid Prime: Hunters might have been good, if they had bothered to release it for the Wii, a console which is several orders of magnitude more suitable for this style of game.

The controls kill this game. A game should be difficult because of the challenge inherent within the game, not because of the challenge of using the controls. It has four control schemes that I am aware of, and none of them worked for me. Two of them are Left-Handed. It boggles my mind why they didn't design one of the control schemes to switch the Fire and Jump functions. Tapping to Fire just seems much more practical than tapping to jump, albeit at the cost of rapid fire, but they really should have taken all the limitations of the DS into account before they put this game into production. What's worse, they removed the lock-on feature, which is present in every single other Metroid Prime game I have played. Did they honestly think the touch screen aiming was enough to offset the loss? This leaves me to decide between two control schemes, one where Aiming is slow and fickle, and the other where I move like I have an inner ear infection. Plain and simply put, there was no way of establishing a reasonable facsimile of the Metroid Prime controls on the DS handheld, and it should not have been attempted on any game they wanted to actually Sell.

I'll confess, I only made it to the second boss, and it was only because the game itself seems to realize how awkward its control scheme is. The first boss was very forgiving, and I managed to defeat him with mostly just determination and patience. The second boss, however, slowly whittled down my HP with a near constant sweep of lasers. I tried Fickle-Aim control the first few times, and couldn't deal damage fast enough to wipe out the boss. I then used Inner-Ear-Infection, and did a little better damage, but had trouble dodging the lasers. Mind you, these are SLOW lasers.  Dying to them was humiliating, but couldn't be helped.

This is a game that really should have been the first Wii tie-in to the the Metroid Prime series. Nintendo has a weird habit of incorporating whatever new gimmick their latest system advertises, regardless of whether or not it works for the title or the game mechanics.  But, the Wii's manual point and shoot is a far more intuitive approach to First Person Shooters, and I'm surprised it's not implemented more frequently.

There is also a lot of DRM. You can't even play a local game on your computer without connecting to Battle.net. The game also requested that I open many ports on my firewall. None of the other games that I own do this.

The game designers also made stupid choices for no apparent reason. For example, you can only change your name once! Why is there a limit at all? That makes no sense!

The campaign mode is terrible. The designers didn't separate the tutorial from the campaign. So, in the campaign, the game gradually lets you build different units. For example, in the second mission you only have Marines, Medics, SCVs, Barracks, Command Center, and Supply Depot. Each new mission introduces a new unit or building that you can use. This is a pathetic way to make a campaign. I wish that on the first mission you had access to all units and buildings. Also, the first 10 missions are extremely boring.

The achievements at the end of each stage are also stupid. The game doesn't tell you what you need to do to earn the achievements before or during the mission.

AI and animations have been improved slightly, not as vastly as EA would lead you to believe, some of the new animations actualy cause gameplay problems where the animation was inapropriat at the time. Some players still walk through others, the running back still stubbornly runs into the o-line untill he trips.

The graphix are tweaked, colors and edges do seem more refigned, but given the Hardware out for PC's, there is no reason why PC gamers are stuck with Ps2/Xbox graphics. easpecialy since even mid range budget cards these days are equal or even better than xbox 360 and ps3.

One bright spot is the hall of fame mode, You can now play as one of the players from this years draft, including this actualy makes me play this aspect now. Though the layout of the appartment is troublesome in some spots as clickable items are too close and with a mouse you tend to click the wrong thing half the time.

Sound....OMG, this is the same dreary commentation as last year, nothing new was added, heck, they still call Devin Hester "" number 23"" ... this guy broke an NFL record and a Super Bowl record, and is the first player to ever have the ingame Speed of 100, and you can't even say his name....

Let me get to the part that is really ridiculous.

Also, your game saves have a better chance of surviving with PS3 or XBOX.

Unfortunately, after taking the time to read up in the Sixsense forums and test it with 15 different games ranging from RTS to FPS and RPG games I still cannot recommend it. The technology behind the Hydra is sound in concept, but it's implementation lacks the polish that could make motion gaming hit it big with PC Gaming Enthusiasts. That coupled with the Software on Razer's side has marred my experience greatly (what Sixsense has done with software and drivers is much better, more on this later). Non existent documentation for setup and configuration was a huge letdown. The average gamer that might want to try motion gaming for the first time isn't going to have an easy time getting this working well with their games. I was really excited to try this because I use both the Kinect and PlayStation Move for gaming and admittedly they are both pretty much hassle free, but I had higher hopes for the Hydra because I am a Hardcore PC Gamer at heart. A lot of people view motion gaming as a gimmick, but it's not. It's just not for everyone. As for the Hydra it's a handful in more ways than one.

***************************************************************************************************************

***The Positive:

Before I get to the negative I'd like to also add some positive feedback. The responsiveness is second to none. It truly is amazing what they have done to make true 1-1 tracking with an accuracy within  1mm and with precision tracking up to 1 degree. The buttons are very responsive. The trigger's on each controller provide a good amount of resistance that will offer most gamers a good experience. Another reviewer stated that it is extremely poor build quality, but the build quality is just fine. The cables are very solid and are reenforced with mesh material which can be annoying, but they planned for them to last. The software developer's are actively pursuing new ways to integrate the drivers and software into Steam to offer a better overall experience for the end user. I''ve also heard they are trying to make it easier to manage custom button mapping. I think it's great that out of the box they have bult in profiles for most games (make sure to use the Motion Creator Software from Sixsense for this, not what Razer offers on their website). The Cables are long enough that you really don't need to worry if you'll have a problem with reaching where you need to play from (the actual mico USB cable from the base station to the computer is a little short, but you don't need the base station centered on your desk.

***The Negative:

There is no documentation that helps you get past the initial hardware setup (you are shown how to plug it in and install the software with the click of a mouse). First off the software on Razer's website isn't the most recent software available. There is actually another company, Sixsense, that you'll need to deal with to get the most recent hardware profiles they call MCEs, which make the Hydra compatible with a larger list of games. Before I could even download the software I needed to register on their website and then wait for 24 hours before an administrator approved my account and gave me access to the forum downloads. Once installed most, if not all, of my games were recognized.

There are different modes available which are kinda like pre-configured profiles for different controller schemes. These are mostly used for FPS games, which makes sense I guess. The only problem is that there isn't an easy way to change button mappings. You'll need to edit the code in each MCE (profile). For some people this is simple and for others this is going be a deal breaker. One really nice feature with the Sixsense ""Motion Creation"" software is that it will let you see a great pictured representation of the button mappings to help you visualize what each button will do for each game. I like the idea of MCE's that come pre-configured for most games available, but the software really needs some graphical way to more easily manipulate button mappings on the fly.

My main problems with the Razer Hydra come into play under actual use. Upon launching any game the cursor is in a different part of the screen (not centered, off to one extreme side), even after supposedly calibrating the controllers. The position varies and is not consistent across all games, while other games work just fine. This makes games unplayable in some circumstances. The reason it makes them unplayable is that calibration depends very heavily on your physical positioning from the base. So if your cursor is to the extreme left then you need to physically situate your body to the right to compensate. This I think is one of the major drawbacks to motion gaming as it currently exists with the Hydra, that's why I said that the concept is sound, but it's implementation has marred my experience. I've yet to find documentation that shows how to easily re-calibrate the cursor's position while in game. Logically once calibrated it should stay consistent across whatever application is used with the acception of the button mappings which obviously need to change on a per game basis. It is however easy enough to re-calibrate/center the cursor when out of a game by just pressing the center button on your right controller when you have the Hydra controller in what you would call neutral position (centered). Another problem that is plaguing my game play is jitter. I can be holding the controller completely still and still have an excessive amount of jitter on screen which makes for a horrible experience in any game when using motion controls. Jitter makes any FPS unplayable. I've found it easy enough to just disable the motion controls and use the Hydra in dual analog mode (basically use it as a gamepad), but this defeats the purpose of owning it if you can't reliably use the motion controls.

This might be a little hard for me to explain, but here goes: It acts like a mouse which is great, but in one sense it can be frustrating. I want you to try something, do this without a second monitor or on the locked sides (vertical instead of horizontal) of your monitors if you have two. First make sure your mouse cursor is on the extreme right hand side of your monitor's screen (the end of the screen). Then take your mouse and set it on the left side of your mouse pad, now move your mouse until you get to the right hand side of your mouse pad then go to the left. Notice how the mouse cursor immediately ignores the actual physical position of your mouse and the cursor will move as long as your mouse movement moves it within the constrained boundaries of your monitor. This is, shall we say, normal and has always been like this. If you ever need to you can compensate easily for this by raising your mouse and placing it further left or right. So if you are all the way left on your mouse pad and need to move the cursor further left then you just pick your mouse up and set it down further to the right on your mouse pad. When you start using the Razor Hydra; a device that uses magnetic fields to monitor the continual relative physical position of the device in 3D space, this can really be a hassle to deal with. However it is easy enough to re-calibrate in windows with the press of a button, but like I said earlier I've not found a way to do so in game.

I've found that the controllers themselves are not very comfortable to hold in their neutral position. This is due mostly to how large they are in relation to my hands. When held properly (in the neutral position) it is relatively difficult to press the buttons with ease and also have your thumb in the proper position to use the analog stick. The overall button spacing makes it easy to press two buttons at once as well, which I have done a number of times. It's also very easy to confuse which controller is left and which is right because they aren't labeled clearly (I can't even tell what labeling shows if ones is right or left). I guess they are designated as ""left"" and ""right"" every time you calibrate the Hydra? Some people might find that the cables used are very rigged and get in the way as well.

I was really hoping for a good experience with the Hydra. After a lot of frustration and troubleshooting I decided to just send it back and get a refund. If the unit didn't experience any jitter and the software was easier to manage in game (mainly issues with claibration) I'd give it a 4 out of 5. Out of all the reviews I've given on Amazon this is, I think, the second 1 star review I have ever given. I don't know if my unit has some defects or simply that this is the experience for anyone who uses the Hydra. This has been my first experience with Razer and if it's any indication of what I could expect with their other products then I'll stick to another manufacture of computer peripherals.","sadly, not a fan at all.",1335225600,8,{'Style:': ' Standard'},

There is enough of power leveling and other things in an rpg and I'm wondering why the overly complicated and confusing customization of equipment, weapons, etc. (so I just gave up and just decided to buy my weapons and equipment); also if a party member is not there only two can participate in battle (and I wondered if this was for the whole game) and I discovered this was many time in the game; plus there are some glitches (like selling an item and can never ever get into the dungeon where needed to open a door and could not get beyond that point and starting the game over).

On another note, which I discovered later and never even thought about because I always thought standard rpgs had HP, MP, etc. and then I discover SC and only a 100 points but in battle there is no indication of how much you are using, whether you run out and I was flabbergasted and just wondered who made this mess up.  I WANT A STANDARD RPG AND DO NOT WANT TO GUESS WHETHER I'M ABOUT TO DIE IN BATTLE WHICH I DID MANY TIMES AND THOUGH I WAS AT HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE BOSS IN QUESTION AND THIS JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE AND FRUSTRATED AND HAD TO TRY OVER AND JUST GOT MAD AT THE DEVELOPERS ON THIS GAME.  This happened a couple of times where I was many levels above a boss and hard as heck defeating them (on the side quests).

And even in battle a majority of the time Rose and party just died and fought battles myself and not bothered (I do not like a divided party like this).  The battle system in Tales of Graces much better and at least I knew where I stood in battle and had a full party and I could use the items normally, and in this game, which many times failed and also using mystic arts failed miserly.

And getting through the many areas and dungeons have been just pure nonsense on the camera angles that get you all turned around and then finding which way to go and also fighting any enemies while doing this is even worse and all I can say is that some of the dungeons (especially the trial ones were very generic and all seemed similar) and why so few treasures in the very long dungeons.

If they make any other games like this I'm not buying any more if they cannot make an rpg where there is normal HP and MP without getting them elsewhere (like in this game from fighting all the major hellions in the game just to get your HP up and levels meant nothing).  Guess we will have to wait and see if they can make an rpg where we can level up normally (instead of grids, ords, etc. to acquire HP as in this one.

I have played over 100 rpgs since the NES days so don't think me a beginner. Have just decided to give up on the game entirely and just consider it a waste of money (book and game given to charity).

The story is visceral and engaging but not for the faint of heart.  Much of the imagery is disturbing and gruesome.  What was there was pretty well done for an initial release, but there just wasn't much there.  I was just getting the feel for the game when the campaign/single player ended.  I was in shock as it was only my second session with the game, meaning I finished it in under 5 hours.

At this point I moved on to the online campaign.  After selecting XBox Live I was prompted for to purchase or redeem an online code.  What?!  I just bought the game why would I need a code.  Its not a PC, its a console, this is odd.  But sure enough I found in my game case the required online access code.  Without this code you can only play up to level 5 in multiplayer.

So with a 5 hour campaign and a required code to play online this game is going to be a real bummer for anyone who buys it used.  They will have to pay to be able to play it online.  If there are multiple people in your house with different Live accounts, they will each have to buy their own code.  This is the most absurd thing I have ever seen with a console game.  With all the compromises that I deal with for console gaming, the one thing I expect is a level of trust that I am not stealing the game, but apparently that is now gone too.

A couple of other pet peeves with this game.  The game would have been even shorter if I had not had to sit and wait seemingly forever for the NPCs to open a door and walk through it, at times right after a checkpoint so that you get to enjoy it multiple times if you die.  That is even if you know exactly where to go and what to do, you have to wait for the NPC to open the door and saunter through it, and then the next NPC to follow before you can then walk through the door.  If you try to go earlier you just get in the way, are not allowed to proceed and slow the progress of the NPC, and ultimately your own progress.  Another annoyance was points of infinite spawns in the game where if you attempted to pre-clear an area you would never finish, had I just moved up at first try the game would have been even shorter and I would have had more ammo.  Finally, there is a sniper mission where you must wait for the NPC to identify the target, and finally give you the OK to fire.  If you shoot anytime before the final OK, you will have to restart the mission.  While this might be OK, it is not made clear until you drop the first target.",A big let down,1301270400,33,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Here's my review-

Graphics-

The graphics for this game aren't the best; and there's no excuse being that the majority of Gamecube games have excellent graphics. Still, I'm at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth, and the framerate is consistent, but man o' man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap. In fact, most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible. The arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures, however, the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at 2-frame loops.
Nothing special to talk about here. The wrestlers don't sell moves, generally do not look hurt and aren't exactly too accurate in size. Generic, boring graphics galore.

Sound-

One redeeming quality of Wrestlemania X8 would be the sound...and that's as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad. The music is really good. Each theme is accurate and a lot better than I anticipated. Just don't expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thud.
There's no commentary which really sucks. I often wondered why WWE games for Gamecube couldn't have commentary when Ultimate Muscle- Legends vs new generation for Gamecube does.

Gameplay-

Here's the really bad part, as if the sound and graphics weren't bad enough, in comes the incredibly boring gameplay.
Westlemania X8 does feature a decent enough roster, but the moves are limited and that's the main problem with this game. The movesets given to each wrestler is about 5 or so moves, a finisher, running attacks, standing attacks and some ground attacks. On paper, this wouldn't be bad, but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam, suplex, as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks. Even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptions.
The match types wouldn't be bad if this game was better. You get single, tag team, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Cage, Rumble, Handicap and some other match types.

The roster could've been really good, but the graphics are so bad that I could truly care less who's featured in this game. The roster consists of- The Hardy Boys, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone cold steve austin, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane and a few others. There are about 40 some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables. But the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the NWO in it and is such a crappy game. I can't stress it any more how much you should stay away from this game. Bad controls, collision detection problems, bad graphics, limited engine, and so many more screwups makes this title only worth owning if you intend on buying the entire series of wrestling games like myself. If you're a collector, get it, if not avoid this one. It's literally the worst wrestling game of the 6th gen and possibly ever ranking alongside such failures like WCW Nitro, WCW thunder and the abysmal WCW BACKSTAGE Assault.

1.0,False,"04 17, 2008",A17KMHCEI7AI56,B0011GBJO8,L. J. L.,"Have you ever seen that movie Groundhog Day? That's the one about the guy who gets stuck in a time loop and has to repeat the same day over and over again. Well, Baroque is the video game equivalent of Groundhog Dog.

Baroque takes place in a post-apocalyptical world where the few remaining survivors have been twisted into strange forms, are haunted by guilt and madness, and remember only confusing fragments of what happened to them. It is this world that your silent avatar is plopped down into and told by the leader of the survivors, the Archangel, to lug a bulky rifle down to the bottom of Neuro Tower, a gargantuan structure that towers over the ruined landscape, and use it to purify the creature held captive down there.

That is pretty much all the direction you are going to get. Baroque is all about letting the player discover things for themselves. Normally, this would be a good thing. However, progression is made as unintuitive as possible. For example, triggering certain events causes Neuro Tower to expand and contract. In RPG's, the traditional way to do this is to hide clues in the things NPC's say. Now imagine a game where say very bizarre things and its only after you talk to them about fifty-odd times that a method to their madness becomes clear. Also imagine the one key clue only has random chance of being revealed after you've gone on the same fool's errand about ten times.

This is really what makes Baroque so frustrating. In most games, the point is to complete a task without dying. In Baroque, dying is a key component of game play. You have to walk into Nuero Tower multiple times and either clear the dungeon or die trying just to get the story to move along ever so slightly so you can figure it out without a walkthrough guide.

Every time I managed to piece together a puzzle, the payoff was meager. I was just handed a new puzzle (or at least I think I was. The game is mean enough to throw something completely pointless at you.) and no or limited new information. In a way, Baroque is lot like assembling a jigsaw puzzle without any reference to what its supposed to look like when complete and all the pieces are buried in an Olympic pool-sized sandbox.

Baroque is game played trapped in a time warp. Each time you clear the tower or die, you are transported right back outside into the town at level one with your inventory stripped from you. You have to go right back into the tower and start everything all over again. As I said before, dying has no real penalty. In fact, it is a necessity for making progress. You could say that players don't lose at Baroque, they only stall. Or you could also say that players don't win at Baroque either, since, win or die, the outcome is the same.

But still, as frustratingly random as I found the game, I did make it to the end. The story starts as confusing clap-trap, but it does clear some of itself up by the end. However, if you have ever played Digital Devil Saga, you have already heard this plot and heard it better with superior characterization, presentation, and cohension.

Baroque is an action RPG. The mute protagonist must enter the tower bare handed and search for weapons, tools, and the NPC's that dwell there while fighting swarms of monsters. In Baroque's favor, combat is not terrible just simplistic. Customization is the key to victory as there are all sorts of accessories and items to collect to boost strength. Essentially there are two health meters, the HP gauge, that decreases as monster injury you, and the vitality gauge which steadily decreases over time and must be refilled with the crystals dropped by slain monsters. The addition of the vitality gauge makes it necessary to search the levels quickly yet thoroughly.

Baroque also boasts lots of tools but most of the thing you come across of marked as 'unidentified' meaning you either have to use them on faith and hope you didn't just inject yourself with a lose a level potion or throw an invincibility item at an enemy or find an appraisal parasite to reveal what the item is. However, the appraisal parasites are few and far between and one use only, so you will be lugging around a bunch of unidentified items in your limited inventory. Items also have lots of other nasty tricks such as armor that doesn't come off or armor that unequips itself every time an enemy comes near.

If I had to pick one really good thing about Baroque is that it has an excellent atmosphere and it really gets you to identify with the characters as they live through their repetitious Purgatory-like world. After traversing the tower for the tenth time, I felt like the poor tormented creature trapped in the basement of the dungeon, repeating ""Don't go crazy"" over and over again.

Baroque is ATLUS's yearly turkey, that one title they seem to put every year that tries to be innovative and off-the-cuff without considering if the end result is a fun game. This is not a hardcore RPG in the sense that the term usually means, which is to say difficult (It's really easy) and one that you must put some real effort into. This is a game that will only appeal to people who can love repetition like the most obsessive compulsive personality. Not recommended.","Baroque Sounds An Awful Lot Like ""Broke"" Doesn't It?",1208390400,14,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

You start out the game with two playable characters: Wolverine and the Human Torch.  You can unlock several other characters but it will require battle points.  You earn battle points by killing, killing & killing (as fast as possible).  The fighting environments are highly destructable, but more often that I'd care to mention, you'll find walls and floor simply disappear- the sprites are terrible & many times your character will be left simply standing in thin air.  The character animations themselves are shoddy- terribly choppy frame rate.

The cut-scenes in-between fights contain grammatically incorrect text.

This version of THPS2 is terrible. Oh, yeah, it's tons of fun when you haven't played the Playstation version, but when you have, you realize just how pitifull this is. On PS, it's rated T, because they don't blurt out words like ""hell"" on songs. On Nintedno, It's rated E, so the whole family can enjoy censored versions of songs by Powerman 5000, Papa Roach & Rage Aganist the Machine. And another thing music wise: THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY THE WHOLE SONG! They cut out one of the choruses and the verses (this is an example), and just let it go from there. And the track doesn't go to the next track when it's done; it just plays over and over and over, to where you have to change it yourself every 3 listens. And it's not just the music.

1.0,False,"06 24, 2015",A1FYQ77OKWUGW6,B00MEXP34Y,The MDT,"I've been a fan of Ninja Turtles for some time now. Granted, I didn't follow them into their newest cartoon incarnation on Nickelodeon (Which this game is based off of - I'm not against it, I've heard great things, I just haven't been interested), and I absolutely hated the recent movie (That older CGI movie TMNT made more sense, and watching the new one has made me really appreciate that one more). Still, I love the concept - teenage turtles using jiujitsu to fight evil aliens and mutants as the unknown protectors of New York. (They're in New York, right? I can't remember if that was ever heavily established anywhere but the movies.) All the while making jokes, having fun, skateboarding, etc. Good times.

This game is reminds you of everything great about Ninja Turtles and delivers on none of it.

The attitudes are all right. The story is okay, I suppose. Common video game practice of ""go here, fight a boss, go somewhere else,"" and the game is set-up like a 3D-modeled 2D sidescrolling platformer, which is what I grew up on and still enjoy playing. But something's off about how it handles. There are several enemies, mostly floating bots with spikes or lasers, that can often get you in a position where you absolutely cannot defend yourself, leaving you open to get hit, occasionally for multiple times. The turtles can seem to do basic attacks forward and sometimes a little bit upward (A boss glitched out and I managed to beat him like that), but there's no diagonal attacks, and sometimes the jump kicks and double jumps don't seem to activate. I tried with multiple controllers and with plugging my controller in - about 20% of the time, something didn't connect when I was pressing the buttons. The same goes for a smoke bomb feature. You're supposed to use it to get around laser barriers by activating the smoke bomb while pressing the direction you're trying to pass. Problem is that several times, it seems to ignore what direction I'm heading. I stopped controlling with the analog stick and moved solely to the D-Pad to make sure it wasn't me just accidentally nudging myself in the wrong direction, but while pressing forward, I'd either be teleported backwards or upwards when I was trying to go forward. I've played through the game twice now - I can say for certain I know how to handle it. It's just the game messing up. Not to mention that when you first get the smoke bombs, you're only allotted to carry three so if you mess up on two of them, you're gonna have to keep spam killing mousers until they FINALLY give you some more smoke bombs. Which has taken me as long as five minutes before. There were also several points where after fighting some enemies up close and then trying to run, my character would simply run in place, letting other enemies with lasers free to shoot me before I could reach them to take them down. Not to mention there being some stuff thrown into the mechanics that is just kind of tricky to get 100% in general. A dash technique is required to break through some windows as well as tight spaces, yet many times when trying to break into those windows, since they're such a small gap, I'll either land above or below the window on the side of the building to where I'll need to double jump again and stick the shot perfectly. More than once, I've tried to break through a window and I'll only be off by a sliver so that in the game I can see and hear glass breaking but my character is still hugging the side of the building. Not to mention that you have basically one button for attack. X is your jump, square is attack, triangle is block, and circle is special item. There's these moves called Shell-kickers you can execute by pressing square three times and then an angle. Sometimes, I'll forget about the angles and just end up pressing square three times, often ducking and attacking or jumping, to where for some reason my character will stop moving and twirl their weapon for about five seconds, leaving me open to attacks I can't block. I think I've been able to break this when it happens by pressing down or up or even triangle, but it happens before I even realize it and then I take damage. What is that move in the game for anyway if it doesn't do anything? Just to punish you if you're not performing Shell-kickers? It's ridiculous.

[EDIT: I'd also like to mention something that I think is a little bit of deceitful advertising. On the back of the box, it shows you driving one of their vehicles - I don't know what it's called, but it looks like a tri-wheel motorcycle with a large shell on top. The truth is that you don't really get to technically drive those at all. Near the very end of the game (When you come back from Dimension X) you unlock that bike as well as a small helicopter. Both of them are merely things you walk over to, press up and X, and then it shows you in them riding to a previous or upcoming part of the map that, honestly, wasn't all that far of a trip, making it a very useless gadget that I barely utilized. Even when I tried to use it, I still ended up way off my mark as they only go to two set places in a cutscene that lasts about eight seconds. Not even any skateboards or sewer surfing in this game. Kinda mad about that.]

The challenge in this game isn't really from its enemies. The bosses are all about the same - just quickly dodge attacks and spam moves or shurikens when you can, cycling turtles for larger health bars. (There is one enemy I had to look up how to kill because I unloaded something like 60 shurikens, countless punches and several health bars to kill it only to find that you need to just kick it two or three times in the head and he's down.) Shredder at the end is even simpler, the bigger challenging being the Foot Clan bots he spawns during battle. Then again, there's a trophy in this game for beating it in under an hour, so I feel like it's designed to be a throwback to the old NES games people like to speedrun. On top of that, the viewing angles suck. So many times I've had to drop down or wall jump up into an unseen area only to have an enemy standing right above/below me where I take a hit, and in the instance of going up, have to start my crawl up all over again and hope I'm luckier as there's no way to scope the area out in advance.

In fact, paying tribute to the NES days seems very vividly apparent from the start of the game. At the start screen, you're treated to a picture of the turtles in a pose that looked very familiar to me - them standing on a large yellow-lighted base, posed in somewhat of a diamond formation fighting Foot bots. The pose is pretty much parallel to the cover art for the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game by Ultra for NES. Then, to add to this homage, in one area of the map, you find yourself underwater briefly, and in the water is what looks like a bomb tied to a small monitor. I don't believe you can interact with it, but down to shapes displayed on the monitor, it is directly lifted from the same TMNT NES game mentioned before in an underwater level where you had to disable bombs on a dam while surrounded by electrified seaweed. Almost had an anxiety attack thinking about the stress of that level from my childhood. The thing is though, that game they're honoring, memorable as it was, was not very good and isn't all that fondly remembered. At least not as much as the Arcade Game (Ported to NES as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game) or the later Arcade/SNES/XBLA game Turtles in Time. That original NES game was known for having unfair expectations, horrible controls, and a lot of scenarios where the only way to advance was to exploit the game's faults. It's not necessarily a classic of the system or even the best Ninja Turtle video game.

I take it I'm not the only one who was intensely frustrated with this game though. Not only did I find a co-worker who had played it and both him and his kid sincerely hated it, but PlayStation's new trophy rarity rankings show it too. Starting the game by talking to Master Splinter gives you a trophy that on PSN is labeled ""Common"" by all players who have played the game. EVERY story-related trophy after that one is marked in the category of either ""Very"" or ""Ultra Rare."" Like I said, the game isn't even that hard to fight - the main problem is a lot of the backtracking. When your turtle's life bar runs out, you don't ""die"", but are rather ""captured"" (Which I think is another tribute to the NES game by Ultra). At that point, you have to find the turtle you lost in a rescue room, labeled with an R on the map. At first, you find out where they're hidden based on blind luck. Pretty soon in the game you get an upgrade that puts a green pinpoint on your map of where a captured turtle was taken, even if you haven't discovered that rescue room yet (The map only shows you what a room is after you've walked inside it). Now, with that mechanic, I would think that the first three rescue rooms closest to me that I find should have a turtle, or the closest ones to where they were captured. Nope. Nope, they're randomly thrown all over the map. I lost all my turtles in Dimension X at one point (See point earlier where I talked about an enemy I didn't know I had to kick in the head.), and when I spawned, my main character was in a rescue room in the middle of the map underground in the sewers. My second turtle was over in an above ground building on the west side of the map in a room I hadn't found yet. My third turtle was in the sewers to the east but still a bit of maze to get to from where I was, and the fourth and final turtle was in a room at the very top of the TCRI building, so I had to backtrack basically through every room of the game I had already played (And by the way, as soon as you leave and re-enter, all enemies except for bosses respawn exactly where they were. So that enemy that killed me in Dimension X? If I kill him, leave the room, and immediately come back - he's there again. It's all random too. I died and ended up in a R room in Dimension X and I didn't want to be there, so my best course of action was to step out and let an enemy kill me again so I'd end up somewhere else. I'm pretty sure it's random, or at least it's a series of alternating patterns, all of which make you traverse the entire game over. Not to mention that if you lose all your turtles, when you come back as the last one you played, you still NEED to get the other three back. It is the most unfair crap I've ever witnessed and just makes me really feel like it's the designers trying to pad out the game by making you kill the same arrangement of enemies in room after room over and over again to kill time and make it seem like you got the full money out of the original MSRP price of $39.99 (I know it's cheaper now, or at least here it is, but this thing doesn't play any different than a $15 download game off the network, and after experiencing it, I think even that's too much. I would really be surprised if the game's assets on the disc even broke 1GB in size).

The rest of it looks sloppy and unfinished, or maybe it's just more of a brilliant homage to older NES games. In every in-game, non-prerendered cutscene, characters mouths aren't even trying to be in synch with their dialog. The mouths just movie up and down as if they're saying ""MEP MEP MEP MEP MEP MEP MEP."" (YouTube it. Tiger Claw and Leatherhead's appearances stood out the most to me.) A couple levels have some platforms in the background that looked like they could be jumped on in the foreground and weren't, while the reverse of items in the foreground looking like untouchable items in the background were also there.

The game is just unpolished, unresponsive, and worst of all, it isn't fun. It's more of a chore to complete if anything, and the rarity of all the story related trophies is a testament to that. I don't understand how this game has seen so many positive reviews here, as at the time of writing this, it has a about four solid stars. Don't get me wrong, it had potential, but it was all mucked up so horribly. Do not buy this game. Do not waste your time. If you're insanely curious, well, hopefully you have the resources to rent it, but otherwise owning this will be just a gross waste of your money. You would be better off hunting down an NES copy of The Arcade Game and reliving the days when TMNT games were at least fun.","Great Ideas, Poor Execution, and a Weird Homage to Mediocrity",1435104000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1ST of all, I don't know who these people are that post reviews before the game is even released but they should be completely ignored!!! Ego maniacs and know nothings wanting to prove they could do a review first I guess.

Basically, this is the same game you have come to love - COD but with new missions. Nothing is really mind blowing or must have about this expansion pack.

I bought this game on the 9/17/2004 at COMPUSA, installed it at 11PM on the 18th and within 4 hours on the 19th, I have finished the expansion pack.

I really feel ripped off. $30 down the tubes almost.

The missions are almost the same as before, infantry, blowing things up, driving a tank but some of the new battles are VERY fierce and challenging. You also get to play as a bomber gunner. There are some new weapons but nothing amazing. The flame thrower is cool but you really never get enough ammo or get the chance to use it under the right circumstances -  like flushing out a bunker!!

The AI is the same. The graphics are the same. The mood/atmosphere is the same.

The missions are still VERY scripted. Your men will not move forward until you do, they get in the way and will not move and block your shots still! The tanks won't go forward until you take heavy machine guns out...even though the tanks should provide infantry with firepower!!!

Is this worth playing? YES. Is it worth $30.....barely.

I would have paid $50 if they had made it longer and more in depth. Why not? The engine is already developed, the bulk of the work is done, now all you have to do is build the levels. I mean...I was done in 4 hours, on the Veteran difficulty setting!!! If I had to choose between spending my money on DOOM 3 or this, I would choose COD:UO. DOOM 3 is scary and edgy...and that is all.

The right mouse button no longer has any resistance, and so any inadvertent touching results in the mouse thinking i pressed the button.  While i can lay my finger on the left mouse button, my other finger must constantly hover just above the right mouse button.  There have been so many inadvertent right clicks because of this, that i finally switched back to my standard microsoft optical mouse, because it was ruining gaming for me.

On top of that, I've experienced what a lot of others have complained about on here, the mouse's optical tracker going haywire.  Generally what happens to me is the mouse won't sense ""down"" anymore, but it sense left, right and up just fine.  I jiggle the mouse around and lift if off the pad a couple of times and it seems to fix itself, but this is unacceptable when you're playing a video game, especially if you're online and others are depending on you.  I've seen reviewers claiming that this is because of dust on the pad, but I don't believe that.  The microsoft mouse i mentioned has no such problems, and it is optical as well.  I even took to regularly using a lint roller on the pad, and that made no difference at all.

Over all, a cool looking mouse, but for all the feature, none of them are worthy of extra stars if the unit does not even function basically as a mouse should.

There are four of us in my family so we went home with the 3 started charecters, Mater, and the Lone Ranger pack. We turned on the game, did not link an account to Disney and Sony, and had Sully on the start pad. The game made us run around through each of the announced levels to get started and once we got to Mickey it opened up to where you could select which stage to play. We put Mr. Incredible on the pad with Sully and tried to play Sullys game. It said over and over waiting for player two to connect, but never gave the second player the option to join. I tried to play Sully's stage solo and he just sat there. No way to control it. Already upset we restart it and I realize we put the carriage on the start pad and not the clear white level piece.

We are ready now! We have the clear white level piece Sully and Mr. Incredible. We try to start up the Incredibles stage and we go through the video intro. We get to where Mr. Incredibly loads and it throws out a warning message saying you cannot play with more than one person without a matching scene character!

So when I saw Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS, I picked up a copy thinking I could have the same amount of fun, only portable. I was wrong. The game is nothing like the original. It's much simpler, and you can't really build impressive zoos. In the orginal game, you hire workers to care for the animals. You can still do that in the DS game, but I still found myself trying to care for the animals. And by care, I mean play annoying little minigames. You're options are severly limited in this version. You can't  build large, good looking areas for guests to sit and eat. There's only a couple buildings you can build, and even with research, there's not that much to build. And it's not even worth it to make buildings anyway. In the orginal Zoo tycoon, it was easy to make several buildings, and they would all generate a lot of profits. In this game, no one even bothers. THe upkeep is almost always more than the money earned. So it's a loss. My finalm complaint is the size. You're only allowed 30 animals, and there's very little space. I filled up over half my zoo with 5 exhibits.

This game seemed to have so much potential. The first Tycoon games were great. But, you can do a lot more in that game, even though it was made several years ago. Even the graphics in the sequel didn't come close to the original. This version was so downgraded, it lost what made the game fun.

I've been through entire game on my DH, and up to inferno on my monk, but I don't see any reason to keep playing.  All my friends have already called it crap and stopped.  I started out playing DH, but now that everyone else has rerolled DH...takes the fun out of it.

With game degrading mechanics all around ranging from:

-max party size is 4...why...I could make a whole list of reasons why this number is ridiculous.  big part of why my group is no longer playing
-drm...you have to play on their laggy, unreliable servers, no hardcore until this is resolved
-don't farm for item, buy them at the AH
-implemented crafting system, that is worthless - buy your items at the AH
-don't farm for gold, buy it at the AH
-character customization is very limited, once you reach inferno your already limited customization is usually reduced to 1 build with MINOR variations
-rune system is gone, yet even less customization
-every class has about -+24 abilities, 1/3 of these are actually useful
-some entire classes are just crap - hi witch doctor
-inferno is pretty much just for ranged characters.  everyone i know has re-rolled sorc or demon hunter
-the game is build around that you will use the AH to buy gear to upgrade, but the insane prices on the AH make it impossible for new players to gear out.  mind you that is today, I can't imagine 4-5 years from now.
-bosses only drop loot the first time you kill them, no matter what the mode of difficulty
-inferno isn't fun, 1 shotted from off screen = not fun, 1 shotted from everything = not fun, it's not even challenging, it's just stupid
-once you hit inferno act 1, be prepared to farm farm farm for cash before you can progress to act 2...for days
-character growth/scaling is insane...at level 50 you are using a 200 dmg weapon i believe, by 55 500, by 60 1600. the scaling makes no sense, why linear growth the entire game until the end then exponential.
-max character level is only 60, you are 60 long before you beat inferno, this appears to be a decision late in the development process which i imagine contributes to the terrible character scaling in the 50s.
-most classes get their best abilities by 20, ...why
-auction house constantly down/very laggy
-some classes (DH, Monk) are WAY better than others at the moment, this can only lead to character normalization or everyone playing the same class.  the classes just aren't well thought out.  they should each be uniquely powerful, and they aren't.  only the ones with invincibility excel, no other contributing factor
-the levels move almost exactly like D2, really...all you could do is send us to 1 new place???
-introduced new chat system, to promote gold sales/spam from third party vendors?  i guess they partner with anyone that pays, because you can't tell me at this point in life they aren't aware of spammers, this is far from their first game.
-no set bonuses, there are set items, but the bonuses are just normal bonuses like +25 str
- itemization as a whole is terrible.  every item no matter what it is, rare, set, legendary, just gets random + stats...could be int on a sword, some bows come with +stats to witch doctor weapons
-no armor types, any class can wear any type of armor, it changes depending on whose holding it - LAME
-legendary items can have worse stats than blues of the same level - ????????????????
-i've had one legendary drop - level 34 item, that's insane - one full game clear, and another char up to inferno
-the same amount of magic find, doesn't increase drops like having NV - giving you the same amount of magic find does.  there is a hidden mechanic
- merc AI is way worse than D2
-mercs do no dmg, provide little support/purpose

Improvements over Diablo 2:
-great party system...based on DRM, and the annoying and confusing blizzard battle tag or whatever its called
-graphics
-sound

Final thought:  The auction house killed this game.  Yes, you can choose not to use it, but that isn't how the game is designed to be played.

Current generation CPU's can process 7 billion computations per second.

My goal keeper just threw the ball short to the opposition and they almost scored. This was almost disastrous. Everyone would be furious, ""what is he doing!!??!"", but instead Martin Tyler is telling me that my goal keeper has just made a stunning save. He is a hero.

Simlarly, a stunning through ball, Messi is one on one with the goal keeper. I take a shot, bahhh it goes wide. Messi just missed a sitter. But Martin Tyler is so impressed with him. ""what a great shot! well done messi"".

A couple of minutes later, the box is heavily defended, I can barely see a patch of green grass. I manage to create something out of nothing. A half chance at goals at best. Understandably it goes wide. Fair effort. My striker did well to even make something of it. But Martin Tyler doesnt see it that way. ""He just squandered an amazing chance"" he claims.

These mistakes in audio commentary are due to the archaic algorithms that still exist in the 20th instalment of the FIFA franchise.

The archaic set of commands that determine what Martin Tyler says.

""IF 'player does this' & 'ball does 'this' THEN commentator says ......""

No other variables? You cant spice things up a bit in the 21st century of computer coding?

I could have written this set of codes on my 86' ATARI.

It doesnt factor into the equation where the ball is, what happened a few moments ago, who is around during the sequence? In fact this data is already there for them to use. (You can get this information during half time with detailed map analysis of what was played and where). Just put this data into the audio algorithm for heavens sake!

It would take EA sports a fraction of effort to add and tweak these few extra variables into the equation. A little bit more data entry, a little more man hours, and a few more bits of command. You could drastically improve the commentary of FIFA 14.

If player was outside the box & there was 4 defenders in front of him & player does this & if ball trajectory does this, then commenator says this....

= ""wow shot goes wide but messi did so well to make something of that. He had no space. Great shot outside the box""

You get the picture

= ""Oh dear he was one on one with the keeper there""
= ""Wow what a cool and calm finish, he still had alot to do""
= ""Oh my goodness Zlatan! My word. A rocket from outside the box""
= ""Oh he squandered the chance, he had Xavi completely free on the right""
= ""Ronaldo! wow he just passed all the defenders""

Take into account the position of the ball, the position of players. Why cant Martin Tyler yet differentiate between a one on one and a long distance shot from outside the box.

Instead, EA sports has made the most minimal of efforts to release new titles for the PS4.

1.0,True,"01 4, 2018",A1YHOMXSM51KBZ,B00FAN4M3S,Nick,"I specifically bought this refurbished Rival for the bumpier grip texture. However, the grip came used and you can tell. A major problem with the Steelseries Xai and Rival Vanilla is that the rubber coating/grip has a perfect day one feel which quickly starts wearing away. The feet are also not rounded from the center like you should see on a brand new Rival Vanilla(they are slightly round at the edge compared to the Rival 300's flat skate). Further, the left click feels too tight and could be enough of a problem on its own.

I also got to point out this strange bug I didn't yet solve that was referenced in another review:
""Mouse can't tell the difference between single left click and middle click. 9 out of 10 times when single left clicking chrome tabs, it thinks im hitting the middle click to close the tab. Will be getting a replacement, or refund for different.""

So, I am disappointed I didn't buy brand new and haven't seen a review touch on any of these refurbished product issues. Also, Steelseries is releasing a Rival 300S to replace the Rival 300, but I guess I still hold nostalgia for the bumpy grip on the Rival Vanilla and round-from-the-center feet.","The top shell is new, but not the grip.",1515024000,,{'Color:': ' Original Black'},

The story is way too poorly covered to convey any real sense of dread - OK, you're fighting evil, but how and when and why Alma became this evil agent is never really explained - nor is most of the rest of the story.

It's doled out piecemeal, as you'd expect with a horror game, but the first 80% of the game has 20% of the story, while the last 20% (when you get to the underground site) has about 40% of the story squished into a small timeframe and area.  That's right - 40% + 20 % = 60%.  So where is the other 40%?  Apparently, hopefully, somewhere in the sequel.

The game plays like a cardboard cutout shooter, too.  The weapons are wimpy (except one, which has too wide of an area of effect to use it for most of the game).  The levels are very drab, run of the mill shooter stuff - big pipes and wooden crates are everwhere.

It's also very short, and the ending, because of the story elements left out of the game, comes up very abruptly.

I have been playing this game for several hours now. Already had at least 5+ lockups. I am having texture flickers all over the place. I really hate it when I am playing an area, stop playing, start up the game later and have crashes in areas that were working OK the previous time I played. The crashes seem random and can happen anywhere in the game world at any time. Same thing happening in FO3. The bottom issue is that there are just to many bugs in this game for being released at this time. Aren't they EVER going to fix that issue ????

I swear that eventually there will be as many updates going on for these games as there are for the PC Windows OS. The one thing I also don't like hearing is, ""well, go to such an such a site and get this and that to - hopefully - fix a problem. What I am saying here is that for the money and the tight Steam mandated online subscription control there should be almost zero issues with this game.

The side quests can get to be so convoluted that it starts taking the fun out of playing. The graphics are dated and no different then FO3. There is one quest that is just absolutely ridiculous. It seems more like a joke on gamers then cool challenge to be met. I think the game should be priced lower as it does not seem as all encompassing as FO3. Actually, I am somewhat underwhelmed with the game and find myself getting a little bored while playing it.

You can buy the game, but be ready to put up with crashes and texture issues at this time. I would be happy if the game was patched and most of the crashes just went away. I have not even seen that yet in FO3.

1.0,False,"10 17, 2008",A1D18FUC8MXZVS,B000ZKDOV2,Marco Bellic,"I finished Saints Row 1 (""SR1"") with 92% completion and I enjoyed it very much while waiting for GTA IV to be released. I thought that SR1 introduced several new features for the sand-box genre and that it looked very good at the time. Now, having finished GTA IV three times (twice with 100% completion) and while I wait for the downloadable content, I decided to buy Saints Row 2 (""SR2"") in hopes of having as much fun as I did with SR1 and more, since I assumed the game would improve from SR1....
 After 3 painful hours of looking at SR2, I needed relief fast, so I popped in GTA IV and just drove around Liberty City so that I can cleanse myself of the nightmare of SR2. I came to realize yet again what a game released in 2008 for the 360 SHOULD look like, or resemble at the very least. I sold SR2 back to GameStop the very next day.

Pros:
Lots of features, side missions to earn respect and customizations, including vehicle customizations
Difficulty Levels
Cruise Control is a cool new feature
Improved combat system over SR1 but still, you can't take cover, other than via ""human shield""

Cons:
Cartoonish-style, non-polished, choppy and stiff graphics with very little fluidity or smoothness.

Lots of bugs, including cars despawning from the streets constantly (turn your character 360 degrees and chances are the car(s) driving down the street have already disappeared).

Sometimes when a cop-car approaches you, the cops warp/teleport out of their car as opposed to actually opening the door and coming out.

While surrounded by cops with 3-4 star cop-notoriety, I was able to beat down 7-10 cops using only a nightstick and saw my health go down by 10%, at the most, despite getting shot at by cops with a shotgun at point-blank range. And this was on ""normal"" difficulty mode. I assume on ""hardcore"" mode, it's possible to lose half of your health, at most, but then watch it regenerate back up again - wow, how realistic and how challenging is that?

Driving looks and feels absolutely horrible. Cars are big and bulky with loose, unrealistic handling. When you hit any object with your car, whether it's another car, tree or pole, you simply bounce off like a pinball and just keep on going.

No secondary camera angles. While on foot or in a car, you can not zoom out to see more of the world, leaving you with just one camera angle with a close and intimate look at the atrocious graphics, considering an October 2008 release for the 360 console.

 SR2 is a poorly made game and the makers should be ashamed to release it in late 2008 and compare it to or compete with the quality and the realistic feel of GTA IV, which is not perfect, of course, but it is still the best. The open-world sandbox genre will always belong to GTA. Yes, SR2 has many features and customization options but what is the point when the game looks and feels so terrible?

I have a similar grip for my 3DS and I was thinking that it would latch onto the body of the XL in the same way, with the little tabs being above the surface of the bottom face of the unit.  They are slightly below the edge, resulting in a very tight fit.  In fact it was so tight that it was somewhat difficult to remove once I attached it to the DS.

I removed the grip after being attached to my XL for less than 30 seconds.  To my dismay, I could see the damage caused by this thing.  The tight fit resulted in small grooves/scratches on either side of the XL's bottom half.  Also the paint was scraped off and it now looks like a thin line of dark grey or black plastic about 1/2 inch long.  It just fits too tight and it digs into the plastic of the DSi XL resulting in these little grooves.

Think of it like how a car looks when it's been keyed.  That's what this grip did to my XL.

first of all, let me blow this idea out of the water right now, that playing this game with a mouse and keyboard is more fun.  IT'S NOT.  it's less fun.  i'm a PC gamer and agree that MOST games are more fun with mouse and keyboard.  not this one.

second, the graphics looked crappy on my PC, but it's not new or anything.  however, it should look better considering the great graphics i get on games like company of heroes and world of warcraft.  my FPS was way too low for these kind of graphics.  it's very ""non-optimized"" for PC.  it almost seems like an advertisement to buy a new windows vista PC so it will run better!  it started out the game in some ridiculously low resolution i didn't even know existed.  i have an old monitor and play in 800 x 600, but who uses any less than that?!?!  apparently the creators didn't know much about PC gaming.

the port of this game from console to PC was not done well.  even in gamespot's full review, they mention how the controls aren't shown on-screen for the PC.. in other words it will say ""to enter, press A"" or ""press B"" like the console version, so you have to enter the menu to find which keys to press.  are you freakin' kidding me?!  the PC is a huge market, and THIS is the amount of respect they give PC gamers?!  on one hand, it's kind of a good thing for console games to come to PC, to give people without a 360 a chance to play.  however, they should put a little more work into it!  some people are worried that the 360-microsoft connection will be the end of good PC gaming, and this game just worries me more.  usually games port from PC to console..  and while i would love to be able to play a few games on PC like ninja gaiden, the fact is a lot of innovation happens on PC games, and we don't want to see the end of that by rich lazy microsoft just making games for the 360 and porting them to PC in substandard fashion because it's better for business.  maybe they will get better about this over time, but after playing the 360 version, i'd say try this one before you buy it!",some kind of sick joke?,1183852800,8,,

1.0,False,"10 4, 2007",A3S2FM1HLD1VQY,B000Q1OTSM,SweetDaddy,"Someone needs to tell S&G Software that it's no longer 1993. Creating games with photographs and video clips in place of digitally created images is about as culturally relevant today as a new Coolio CD, so it's hard to see what the developer was thinking when it made Anacapri: The Dream. This throwback to the era of The 7th Guest may include thousands of photographs of one of the most gorgeous vacation spots on the planet, but it plays more like something you found at a yard sale than a game you pulled down from the new releases shelf.

The line between games and movies is sort of blurred in the structure of the game. While the play style holds tight to the point-and-click adventure template, the game is constructed solely with still photos that give your jaunt the vibe of an indie film. So even though you play a stereotypical sleuth looking to solve the mystery of the ancient Obsidian Disk on the island of Capri, the atmosphere is quite different from the sorts of adventures you might be accustomed to. Thousands of photos depicting everything from seaside vistas to cobblestone roads, to the many quaint shops lining the narrow streets of the titular town of Anacapri, give you the impression that you've embarked on a real trip to the exotic Mediterranean locale. The gameworld is absolutely massive, so it frequently feels as if you're really exploring all of the crooks and crannies of the island.

However, there are prices to pay for this type of presentation and the sheer size of everything. Many of the most potentially picturesque outdoor shots are blurry or strewn with artifacts, presumably to keep picture size reasonable. Oddly, the most sharply detailed pics are the dull ones that show a shopkeeper behind his counter or an old man sitting on a bench. Regardless of quality, there is an air of absurdity to the whole affair because of the use of multiple shots of people during conversations to give the illusion of movement. Done more subtly, this might have been a good idea, and might have nicely added the illusion of movement to what is otherwise a breathless game. But all of the changed poses and expressions given to Anacapri residents are wildly exaggerated, so encounters with them come off like some sort of bizarre mime show. Finally, there are some technological issues in the install process due to the high number of photographs. There are so many photos included as single, high-resolution files that the installation takes almost as long as a flight to Capri itself. You might want to brew a pot of coffee for this one, as it takes a good two hours for all seven gigs of picture files to be transferred from the DVD to your hard drive.

Unfortunately, this time isn't well spent. The game amounts to little more than a great selection of somebody else's vacation snaps. Gameplay lacks structure, due largely to the sheer size of the island. The game itself is such an afterthought that it feels like something hacked together at the last minute to justify writing off a vacation to Capri. Although you're assisted by a hotspot system that highlights key locations on each photograph, it's ridiculously easy to get lost because the entire island is open at the start of the game. Make a wrong turn, or simply get befuddled over the game's many vague clues, and you're soon off on an unintentional sightseeing tour. Although it's relatively easy to work your way through most in-game situations by doing some careful pixel hunting, closely following all of your instructions, and continually checking the city and island maps to see where you are, you still need a walkthrough to figure out how to get where you need to go.

Adding to the confusion of Anacapri is a plot that values nonsense about the nature of reality over the virtues of an easy-to-follow narrative. As if the real-world island wasn't hard enough to figure out, you regularly have to chug dream syrup that sends you off to explore surreal lands populated by ghosts and mythological monsters. Set-piece puzzles that bypass the absurdities of the plot are the only strength here, and there aren't nearly enough of them to compensate for the awfulness of everything else. Most don't even show up until near the end of the game, such as the nifty series of sphinx riddles, and the tile puzzle that is one of the final barriers to the Obsidian Disk.

Horrific voice acting and scripting, along with some truly weird musical choices, sprinkle extra strangeness into everything. Strangers stop to talk as if they were long-lost friends, and the topics of conversation often seem nonsensical until you start looking back on things and putting together the big picture. All of the characters in the game are voiced by a handful of terrible actors making lame attempts to change their voices with bad accents, which makes even real-world interactions with people shimmer like hallucinations. The dialogue is universally overwrought, characterized by lines such as ""That disk will remain a dark stain on our past and humanity forever,"" spoken with all of the passion of a fast-food counter jockey asking if you want to supersize your value meal. Music is frequently jarring, and bounces all over the place between poppy lounge music and driving guitar. It's like you're being stalked by somebody with a xylophone on wheels and Yngwie Malmsteen, respectively. Thankfully, there are frequent, long stretches of silence.

If it were a relic from the early 90s, Anacapri: The Dream might be worth a play for the nostalgia factor alone. A ""so bad it's good"" vibe also creeps into the adventure through the voice acting, almost giving you the feeling that you're reliving some fond memory that hasn't aged particularly well. But you're not, and considering that the longing for a bygone day is the only possible reason for playing this backward game, you'll soon get tired of flipping through photographs and move on to something more modern and more competently designed.",Someone needs to tell S&G Software that it's no longer 1993,1191456000,13,,

Watch the puck teleport through my goalie's pad.  Not screened, no deflection, a shot a high school goalie could stop.  Oh, did I mention this goal tied the game?  This is the kind of crap you will put up with if you play this game.  Keep the team to the perimeter, clear the crease, game tying goal on an easy shot.  I can't believe I paid $60 for this.

So I wrote a long review of this game, but came back to edit after playing 25 games.  It kills me to say this, but this game sucks.  There is a comeback engine in the game that is maddening, frustrating, and makes the game little to no fun to play.  Basically, if you score, plan on the opponent scoring as well.  I've had games up 5-0, 4-0, and 3-0 going into the third, invariably the opponent will go into ""God Mode"" and become unstoppable.  I've had opponents do the following:
1. Skate through 4 defensemen, score over the goalie's pad even with the goalie having the angle
2. Take a terrible shot, the kind you don't even take in hope of rebound, that the goalie doesn't see until the last second, despite a lack of a screen
3.  Get poke checked only to do a 180 degree turn from the waist to grab the puck and take a shot that goes in from the high slot, again with no screen
4.  Dump the puck from the rear blueline on the PK, only to bounce on net and become too hot to handle for my goalie
5.  The piece de resistance; a poke check from a tied up face off that sneaks five hole despite being slow enough for my grandmother to handle

Every time these improbable things happen, and they happen with regularity, I am winning.  Mind you, none of these things happen if the game is scoreless, or you are losing, only if you are up.  It has gotten to the point where my wife said ""you don't even celebrate scoring goals any more"" and I don't because they will score to match you and keep it close.  I went into the season stats to find data to prove this, and it is there.  My goalie is leading the league in wins, but is 55th in Save Percentage and 49th in Goals Against Average.  The only reason this can be possible is because they always match me nearly goal for goal.

I should have known better after buying Madden 12.  Thing is NHL 12 was so fun, I played that game like it was going out of style, and while goalies would let in the occasional softy in NHL 12, they are Patrick Roy compared to the goalies in NHL 14.  It's almost ironic that they chose a goalie for the cover of this years game because your goalie will suck in this game, no matter how well you play.  I even set my strategy to play more defensive, kept everyone back and only tried to score off the breakout, didn't matter, still gave up 4 (because I scored 4) and lost in a shootout.  If you score, you have to play like you have an empty net behind you.

Emmett Wallman,"i am an avid basketball fan and i can't resist basketball games for the playstation 3. i know there is a lot of competition out there with the nba and college games and even streetball. while i stay away from the street versions, i love the college and nba games. well, ea sports has been pretty crummy in the past with their ps3 games (madden 07 mainly) i have played both the 360 and ps3 versions. while i only own the ps3 version, its exactly the same except there are no achievements to boost your gamerscore. while many say the 360 version is better, i don't agree. my 360 recently died to the red ring of death and i am stuck with the ps3 and i love it. so no matter what system you buy this for, its the same game. while the game plays smooth and there are lots of extra features in the game, its still not a very good game. neither is college hoops 2k8 though. i haven't seen a good college basketball game yet for the ps3. the game would earn a 4.5/5 overall if it wasn't for the terrible graphics. the players look weird on the court for some reason. they look like walking stick figures my brother said, and i have to agree. the arena details are not there at all. the crowd looks like dots and i understand that, but i am a season ticket holder for the wisconsin badgers with courtside seats and i can definately see how different the kohl center looks in theis game compared to real life. i also watch the kansas jayhawks, ohio state buckeyes and my cousin attends marquette and she is on the dance team which means she attends many of the college basketball games. we both agree there are no arena details. the court looks average though. the sidelines and endlines look verry jagged, but that's no big deal.
so i will sum up the pros and cons of the game:

+around 150 teams to choose from
+game plays smoothly on the ps3
+startup and menus are cool
+difficulty isn't too hard

-arena graphics are terrible. there aren't any to speak of. i don't feel like i am looking at a college basketball game. the arenas look like walls with dots for the students/fans. phog allen fieldhouse looks like a boxed in room.
-free throws can be hard for beginners

overall score:
without including grading of the graphics: 4.5/5
overall with the graphics: 2/5

The game is actually...a poor man's minigame collection. The minigames you find on this thing are either dull or are knockoffs of old timey games. For example, the blinking traffic light minigame is just another Simon. The minigame with the car ""Snot Rod"" is a variation of bunches of LCD electronics, in which you just simply dodge cars. The minigame where you fill up gas for cars....That's just dumb and plays badly.

Apparently, there just so happens to be racing....But believe it or not, THAT plays more like a minigame than freaking Mario Kart!! On top of that, the AI is dumb as rocks. Chick (the green car) always wiggles around and the other cars just stay still. Oh wait...I'm only against Chick? BULL. And guess what? You can even cheat in the race. Just keep using the brakes to build up speed (Because you'll automatically be moving forward anyway), and once the finish line comes, just zoom in to win.

After having let it charge I paired it with my PS3, following GIOTECK's instructions, and found 2 major issues right off the bat.

1: This headset IS NOT NOISE CANCELING despite of what the packaging, and GIOTECK's website indicate. I had a neighbor over at the time I received it in the mail and asked her if she would help me test it. I sat at my desk with my PS3 and TV, while she sat opposite me across the 10ft. room. I asked her, soft spoken as she is, to speak to me while I had the headset active. She spoke just above a whisper and I could hear her clearly in the headset speaker. She clicked the mouse on the desk, across the room, and I could hear it in the headset speaker. This stunned me as I have been bothered numerous times by people who have headsets like this, which are not noise canceling, which pick up the slightest sounds in the room they are playing in such as their TV volume, their parents or siblings yelling at them, dogs barking in the next yard, and even cars driving by. On top of this, when these people use headsets like this it causes a doubling, or echoing effect when playing games. I can't hear what is being said in a game because I am hearing the dialogue and sound effects twice as it overlaps through the co-op player's headset. This EX-02 headset is NOT noise canceling with my neighbor speaking softly across the room. How am I supposed to not create an echoing effect for someone else when my TV is between my neighbor and I and not even on? If her voice comes through the headset it's guaranteed that my TV volume will be the only thing a co-op partner will hear.

2: There is also a recurring, tapping sound that comes through the headset speaker. It sounds like someone flicking a pie tin with their finger. It recurs so often, and is so loud that it causes the headset to be completely unusable.

There are some good things about the headset though. The LED lights on the unit are bright, clear, rich colors. The buttons are easy to press, and activate their functions nicely, and the interchangeable face plates are a nice touch, though difficult to change without feeling like you will void your warranty trying to pry them off. No instructions on how to change the face plates are included.

The included instruction pull out was easy to read and understand, in fact it's one of the nicer, easier to read instruction literatures that I've seen in a long time with my favorite being, ""Point barrel toward enemy"".

To sum up, this EX-02 headset by GIOTECK is an attractive, lightweight design but fails terribly in its usable quality. Many would opt to state that, ""You get what you pay for"". I would submit that if a company manufactures a faulty product at a low price of $20.00, then gets even 100,000 people to buy it, then toss it in a drawer when it doesn't function properly, that company just made $2,000,000.00 counting on those people saying, ""Well, you get what you pay for"".

Well, as is, out of the box, and brand new, this EX-02 headset for the PS3 has worse usable quality than an analog phone.

I purchased this headset so that I could pull it out of a bag, turn it on, and game it up without having to unpack a pair of headphones and connect all the cables and cords. After purchasing this headset, I find that I am still looking for a compact, easy to use, wireless, noise canceling headset, having not found the solution in the EX-02.","Terrible Usable Quality, Waste of Money.",1362960000,6,,

*******************

I'll keep this review short given that there are 800+ reviews for this game already.

(I have the collector's edition which is why I don't show up as a 'verified purchase')

THE GOOD:
=========

1. Fun to play
It's still fun to play, although it is still the same mindless, hack and slash, quasi-RPG game that the previous two are.

2. Decent presentation
Graphics and sound (music/sound effects/etc) are pretty solid, if uninspired.

3. Isometric view
I am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game, like Bethesda did with Fallout 3.

THE BAD
=======

1. Server ""issues""
'Nuff said.  Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game.

2. Quasi-RPG, with NO CHARACTER BUILDS/CUSTOMIZATION (i.e. LITTLE REPLAY VALUE)
Nothing is permanent, including character 'development'.  By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes (dexterity, strenth, etc.), Blizzard really took out the ""quasi"" in ""quasi-RPG"".  It's actually a straight up action game, with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE.  So absolutely ZERO character customizations.  Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character, because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time.  Don't like your current skills?  Well, just choose another one, they're all available after all!  Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game.

3. Complete Re-hash of Diablo II (i.e. NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME)
This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere.  The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before, as long as you have played D2.  Specifically...

4. Lack of Randomized dungeons (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Everything is in the same location, or so it seems at least.  The continental maps are the same, so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze.  The 'dungeons' (there are actually few dungeons), or locations, all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game.  This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE.  Let's say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is.  No point in ever playing the same class twice, since there is no 'build' anymore for characters.

5. Lack of Atmosphere
It really looks like WoW in an isometric view.  Completely gone is the claustrophobic, disturbing, and foreboding atmosphere of D1.  Everything looks cartoonish, which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill.  Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use.  Don't be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands.  And a coop battle looks like you're at some kind of a rave or Phish concert.

6. Miscellaneous
Bad writing, distracting attempts at humor, very poor voice acting (especially Leah), and tedious intro/cutscenes.

OVERALL:
========
3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

++
********************
(UPDATED (5/18/2012)
********************

So, I finished the game on 'normal' difficulty and got up to level 31 with my Demon Hunter.  Add a few new ""goods"" and ""bads"" for this game...

GOOD
====

1. Better Cutscenes
The ones at the end are better than the earlier ones (e.g. it's possible to watch it through without hitting ESC).

2. Still Fun (for now...)
Yes, it is still fun to play, despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously.  Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty, I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack(s) comes out.  I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs, which should say something about the casual playability of this game.  Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development, it is still fun to 'unlock' new skills to use.  Much of the fun does derive from leveling (read: grinding) and item collection (who doesn't still love to collect rare, unique, and now legendary items?).

BAD
===

1. Too SHORT!!! (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Maybe 15-20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty, and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS.  It's shocking actually, and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2.  For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2, similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1.  But no, there are still just 4 (I think) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete.

2. Lame Bosses/Lairs (i.e. Zzzzzz...)
Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame.  Half of them are just gigantic, bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another.  Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique.  The lairs are similarly boring... most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured.  The boss action, of course, is pure 'grinding' at its finest.  In the later acts, the bosses are almost back to back to back, which to be quite honest got tired really fast, especially when they all seemed the same.

3. Horrible Skill Interface/System (i.e. FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE!)
Yes, the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes (which are not physical items either) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning, and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills.  Fine, let there be a 'cool off' time for switching skills, but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you're not likely to do it in a battle.  So, that means that essentially you're stuck with a half dozen skills, max, at any given time.  This feels very limited and boring, especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun.

4. Linear Gameplay (i.e. GO FROM A > B > C > D...)
More so than D1 or even D2, D3 is super linear.  There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps, and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another, limited your ability to explore.

OVERALL
=======
It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways.  Primarily the lack of character attribute/skill customization (e.g. no 'builds'), the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2, and the small scope of the game.  I couldn't believe that Diablo came so soon, and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something, but alas, it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene.

3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

********************
(UPDATED (5/20/2012)
********************

BOTTOM LINE
===========

So, I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and... I just uninstalled it.  The truth is, the more you play, the higher level you achieve, the less you want to continue playing.  This mostly is a result of the lack of character development/customization (and by that, I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop/specialize skills as in D2) and the overall similarity to D2.  The over-simplication (and let's not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with... hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game.  The bottom line is -- it's just not that fun to play over and over again.  It's also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House, which no normal person would (or could) actually use to try to make money off of the game.  I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay (remember the 'grandfather sword' anyone?) but it's hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game.

In the end, I have to say that while fun for awhile, D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series.  For me, it provided less than a week of gameplay, unlike D2 that I played for months and months.  It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s, and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises.  Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games (e.g. dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal) changes, I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever.  Thank God for Kickstart, which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead (Wasteland 2!!!)...

Final (downgrade) Rating:
2/5 for brief, mindless fun
1/5 for overall quality of the game

*******************
UPDATED (6/1/2012)
*******************

Yes, I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add.

So, I have the collector's edition (completely worth the $100 given all the goodies it comes with), which includes D2/LOD on a USB flash drive.  After uninstalling D3 (after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty), I decided to see how D2 looked and played (haven't played it since 2001, after getting the LOD expansion pack) after all these years.

Well, D2/LOD is still great!  I've been playing for about two weeks (more than twice the time I played D3 for), building a Werebear Druid, and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow-up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal.

MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3
==============================

1. HAND-HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY (e.g. D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD!!)
Yes, the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers.  So, LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY, which other players cannot see let alone pickup.  I mean, how stupid is that?  It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand-holding and 'noob-ification' of this game.

Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls.  What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them, and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town (complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands), right?  And identify scrolls, a RPG staple from the earliest days, well, why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it?

Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations (well, the first time you play through that is, because those locations don't appear to ever change)?  Well, no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO, and if you are close to an important place.  Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps, but nothing even close to this level of hand-holding.  Can anyone really question the noob-ification and extreme linearness of this game?  There's not even an option to turn those map 'hints'/guides off.

Yet another example is the noob-ification of the GEAR REPAIR/durability system.  In D3, items have a durability rating (e.g. 24/24) but that never seems to decrease (or at least, very slowly), despite using your weapons and taking damage.  Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy, so really what was the point?  In D2 (and other RPGs), you fix your gear so that it doesn't break because typically you can't just weld a broken sword back together again!

And of course, don't forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them, instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed.

So, yes -- Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game.  Hell, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding!

2. ABSURD STORY
By now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe-inducing story of D3 (I won't 'spoil' it for those of you who haven't played it yet, but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC).  D2, on the other hand, had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out (if not particularly original) story of the 'Dark Wanderer' (your character from D1), which provides the backdrop for D2.  And don't even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series, Leah...

3. 4-PLAYER CO-OP LIMIT
Eight player co-op games in D2 are great -- too bad you're limited to only four players in D3.  Just stupid.

4. OTHER BATTLE.NET ISSUES
The game creation system for multiplayer co-op has also been simplified, in a bad way.  You can't name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest.  It's very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value (which is not very high to begin with, unfortunately).

5. SILLY D1 'BOSS' CAMEO
Yes, you've all heard the rumors/spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss (arguably the most famous and well-liked boss from the Diablo series) in D3.  No, it makes no sense why this character, who was killed in D1, would return (complete with memorable catchphrase), but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a 'treat' for Diablo fans.  It's not.

6. DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELS
Seriously?  In hindsight, this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting.

CONCLUSION
==========
Don't believe all those 'expert' reviews on the internet, like the mindboggling 100% rating (!!) from Joystiq.  These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree, due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and/or other perks they may receive (e.g. being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks, etc.) that unduly influences their game reviews.  In light of this, it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3.

This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game.  Actually, it's below average.  It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways (gameplay, battle.net, etc.) it is than its predecessor, the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took (12 years, holy smokes!) to finally come out, and because of Blizzard's thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House -- a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree.

Bottom line?  Diablo 3 is fun to play... for a few days.  The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1, so much more engaging to play... and play again and again.  Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game, with deal-breaking noob-ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play.

If you have played quality RPG games such as Skyrim as I have, there is a high probability that you will have difficulty enjoying this game. I will explain my reasons below.

Pros

This game does a few things well but these tend to be the norm these days. Visual design is solid and the atmosphere looks clean. Character model looks fine but nothing extraordinary.

Cons

This game fell apart as I discovered many flaws in the basic mechanics of the game.

1 - Difficulty level is artificially high. Even on the easiest setting, there are little loot to find in terms of ammo and health, which makes it very difficult to survive combats even in the beginning levels. Enemies gang up on you, which is fine, but you are unable to defend yourself due to lack of health potions. I consistently died and had no other option but to run away and wait for my health to regenerate.
2 - Voice acting is REALLY REALLY bad. These actors sound like they just started acting. There is no conviction or passion in their voices, which combined with poorly-animated facial models, makes the cutscenes nearly unbearable to watch.
3 - Combat is very sluggish. The response rate of control inputs seems laggy most times, and it takes several hits to take down enemies.
4 - Enemies are dull and just lame in some cases. Strolling through the swamp, I was attacked by a tree and nearly died. Seriously??? A tree? Is this really worthy of putting into an action/RPG game???
5 - Menu system and map navigation is confusing. I had a very hard time following the map to my next objective because the map does NOT rotate so even if you are walking to the left of the area, on the map it could show you walking to the right side of the map. It's hard to explain this but if you play the game you will know what I mean.
6 - Upgrade system is flawed and useless. You gain XP by completing missions and defeating enemies, which earns you skill points that you can spend on the skill tree or passive skills. However, these don't seem to make a difference in your performance; I could not tell any difference at all even after leveling up to 7.

Overall, there are just too many little flaws and quirks for me to enjoy this game. In short, this is a horrible game; one of the worst I have played. I absolutely CANNOT recommend this game at all.

Playing Masterchief Collection last night with a friend, it took nearly an hour to play multiplayer. This seems to be pretty typical. The party system was bugged, and we couldn't join each other. After we got that resolved it froze on 'Searching for Players' for 10+ minutes. The only way to fix that was to force quit at the dashboard, and reform our group. Rinse and repeat this a few times, and we finally get in and it disconnected us and everybody else who was playing. It also put some of the other players in our party for some reason? We had to disband, and restart again.

I will say that Halo 4 runs incredibly better on the XBox One than it did on the XBox 360, and I'm sure all of the campaigns are functional. I however would not recommend the game to anyone that wants it for multiplayer.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min.

However, the write speed on this thing is absolutely offensive for the price.  I transfered a 750 MB video file from my computer to my Vita, and it took around 7 minutes.  This means that this card will write at 1.79MB per second.  However, a 64GB SD card that costs $25 on Amazon has write speeds of up to 48MB per second.  A $51 micro SD card on Amazon has a write speed of 80MB/second.

This means that there is a piece of technology that is very similar to this, which costs 25% of the price, and is over 24 times faster.  If you are willing to pay half the price of this memory card on a Micro SD, that Micro SD card will be more than 40 times faster than the Vita memory card.

The price point of this memory card coupled with the horrible speed makes me wish I hadn't gotten the Vita.  Transferring 17GB (about 3,000 songs) of music took me over 4 hours to transfer.

1. They improved the graphics quite a bit in this game and the sound is just spectacular.
2. The missions are very fun, and the story really keeps you hooked up. Only bummer is that it's a little on the short side (+/- 4 hours)
3. The way killstreaks now work is pretty cool. You can have different killstreaks with each gun class and the ways in which you can customize these killstreaks is almost endless.
4. New game-modes are also a lot of fun. Hardcore Domination is definitely my favorite but there is also Kill-confirmed and many others which are very enjoyable. Anyways I didn't read the other reviews here but I'm sure many people already described these in detail.

Now the bad:

1. Matchmaking is terrible!! I did some research and apparently IW or Sledgehammer (not sure who is to blame here) decided it would be a good idea to hard-lock the servers so that when you try to search for an online game it will only look for matches in YOUR area. This is so ridiculous, since, if you're unlucky like me, you live in an area where there aren't many MW3 players online on the 360. Matchmaking takes anywhere from 2 - 10 minutes to find a game (even a simple team deathmatch)and sometimes it doesn't find one at all. Apparently IW is aware of the problem and rolled out an update (4MB on the Xbox) but this update did not change a single thing. I've also double checked my router/xbox settings and everything should be properly set up. Any other game I play online does so flawlessly including MW2/MW/BF3/BF2/BO/Halo:3/Halo:Reach/Homefront/FIFA...
2. Hackers!

1.0,False,"07 6, 2014",A13A943ZWQVT0Z,B000SSPH3E,A. Golden,"A lot of people seem to disagree with me here but I find this version to be a big downgrade from the original. Here are the differences, broken into pros and cons:

Pros:
-New classes (but they're really not very good anyway and reuse animations/skills from the old game)
-Two new characters (again, they're not really that good and not worth it)
-""Improved"" dialogue, which I actually hated more than the old dialogue
-Some tweaks and balancing fixes, which are actually a good thing
-New cinematics

The only two pros that are actually a good thing, IMO, are the tweaks/balance fixes and the cinematics. However, there was still something charming about the old cinematics, so I don't mind going without them.

Cons:
-Obnoxious slowdown that will drive you insane if you've played the original
-IMO, the new writing is awful. I was excited to hear that they'd rewritten the dialogue to make it less confusing and better than the old, poorly translated version. However, to me, it's even worse. It attempts to use some Old English language that is very confusing and cheesy, with terrible grammar. They should have hired better writers for this.
-The audio quality is DOWNGRADED. In a game with such an amazing soundtrack, this is a huge issue for me. If you don't believe me, get both versions on the Vita and listen to them side by side, with or without headphones. The music reverberates beautifully in the original game but sounds flat and dull in the new version.
-LOWER resolution, at least on the Vita. Buy the original PS1 version and it actually looks better (sharper)
-For some reason it seems they want you to have to click a lot more in this version to confirm movements and actions. It gets annoying quickly, even after turning part of it off in the options
-They also added some annoying confirmation sound for every piece of dialogue. I was never able to figure out how to turn it off and it wasn't in the original (original had some nice page-turning sounds)

Overall, this port is insulting to such an amazing game. If you have a Vita and don't mind the lack of fullscreen, just get the original game from the store. It's cheaper, anyway.

From Tim Allen's Power Tool Pursuit to Shaq-Fu, these games sucked and obviously tried to bank on the celebrity status to move the games to the fans. That is what Rouge Warrior is like, a retro dollar bin game coded by first year computer science interns.

I was looking forward to this game. I liked most of the Rogue Warrior series (When Dick wrote with John Weisman) and Bethesda Games are normally top notch. But this one slipped though the creative QA process. Here are a few of my observations; The enemies are stupid. Their backs are turned most of the time and I can clomp up to them (no stealth) and do a kill move which is a cut scene to a poor graphic close up shot. There is no health status bar, no character development, the weapon action is just sad. I can shoot someone with a silenced .45 @ 50 yards and score a one shot kill yet I can empty a nearly a full clip into an enemy in the same room and they are still standing. Oh and grenades? Yeah they do not work hardly at all.

Bottom line: Man does this game suck. Certainly gets my vote for the worst of 2009. I would only buy this if:
- You like Demo Dick so much, that you have to have everything with his name on it
- You collect crappy games and this would look great next to Outpost
- You like to hear folks say the F word because although Rogue Warrior is a crappy game with the controls and playability of a Tofu sword, Demo Dick has to cuss alot to show that he does not listen to orders and is his own one man A Team without the cool van.

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)
_ Throw-ins are just a joke! Players spend most of the time running after the ball themselves as if there's no one out there

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

When your on top, there are those who say you can only go down from there, and I feel that right now this is what is going on with the ps3. I kept hearing talk of the graphics. People were talking about how amazing they would be. Often people hear this and just have in there heads that the graphics are outstanding. While the graphics do look good, you will not notice much unless you have a high deff tv. I know alot fo people have them but I choose not to spend over 1500 dollars on a tv. So unless your a person with a really great tv the graphics will not be as good as they could be. Sony cut alot of there market by doing this. You must think of every one in order to succeed.

I hear that there are game companies with Playstation 3 games finished, but they will not release until the fan base grows. So even after companies spend all the time and money on the ps3 games they still will not let sony sell them. They would rather loose money. That is how low the sales of the ps3 are. The reason the price is so high is because Sony is failing in there $1000 blu-ray dvd players. So they put one in the ps3 to get people to buy dvds to use it with. Then I'm sure they think people will buy a blu-ray player. So what it comes down to is Sony is failing in psp,blu-ray,umd,and ps3 sales.

This poorly-coded console port, made only worse by uplay (which is a terrible joke in and of itself), is riddled with inadequacies. First of all, the initial commands are a joke, so get ready to do some serious mapping before getting into the game. The entire concept of stealth seems to be more of an option, leaning more toward the first-person shooter than the ""oops, my light detector is going off, I'd better hide."" On ultra settings, this game appears less than stable and tends to lag once the frame right bumps slightly (this is on a GTX860M and i4700HQ). In other words, if you only have a brief second to see a command option whilst zip-lining, I'd bump down the video settings. I haven't even bothered with the multi-player, as once I complete the campaign, this is getting uninstalled posthaste.

To elaborate further on uplay, a sad equivalent to steam, each time I've started the game I've had to wait for yet another update to be applied. Assuming that isn't system-specific, it's exceedingly annoying. Although the graphics are very nice, I feel like the shortcomings are too great to overcome.

The game bugged out on me in training and I couldn't drive the truck like I was supposed to. I gave up on it and a week later my computer basically tanked.

Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in ""some"" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.
UBI Soft's tech support has said that this ""feature"" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  ""Flawed"" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.

2. The combat is clunky and cumbersome. Also, you are limited to carrying 24 rounds of ammo for your gun for no reason whatsoever! I angrily left behind ammo because I had too much. This forces you to do melee combat or run. With the crappy camera angles, especially in hallways, that translates to running. Thats not fun.

Honestly, it's the most gorgeous game I've ever seen to date. At the same time, probably the least fun to play of all of the games I've owned in years, which I can't even believe I'm saying.

As a game, I would have rather played Battlefront 2 for the PS2 - which I still own and just played a moment ago to see if I was crazy.  Turns out I'm not crazy, and neither are the many people who have written these negative reviews on the game.  There was so much hype and so many people who hoped for the best (like me) or prepared for the worst (unlike me)...  I am so disappointed. After 24 hours, I feel crushed and broken, and I feel like my money has been wasted.

As for the actual review, I will say that other than the ""Walker Assault"" mode, the rest of the game play seems to be a bore to me.  I had a lot of fun with the beta and thought there would be much, much more. OK, there are a few more maps and modes to play with, but as a solo guy with no roommates or family, and not really a strong community of PSN friends to join for these online game modes, it's just not the game for me. And before I get scolded for saying that, it is my fault because I knew it would be more online based.  I just assumed the game developers were being ""hush hush"" about any campaign modes that might be there.  I gambled and lost. My mistake.

The guns are fine. I don't mind them the way others do.  Being a Hero/Villain is fun.  But after an hour, I just want to go play another game.  Flying vehicles are cool....  but...  Why do I have to die to get out of a Tie Fighter/X-Wing, etc.?  Why can't we go to space? WHAT IS STAR WARS WITHOUT SPACE???  And don't tell me it's coming later in a downloadable map. I'll be even more upset if it comes later because that just tells me they could have released a game with space battles from the start, which actually may have made this game 1000x better by itself. (y'all really screwed that up IMO).  What a waste, Dice/EA.

In my opinion, this game is absolutely inferior to Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I would have been happier with a remastered Battlefront 2 for the PS4.

It truly breaks my heart to express such harsh criticism. Although this ""review"" is more of me complaining than actually reviewing the game, the truth of the matter is that there's not a single thing I can say that hasn't already been said here in the other reviews, over and over again.  It truly is a spectacle to see...  and nex-gen graphics with something we all love, in Star Wars.  But horrible for a video game. This would have been better as playable trailer for the new movies.  As a game, It's nothing at all like the teasers or behind-the-scenes videos/documentaries I've watched for the past 2 years. It's not even as good as Battlefront 2, in my opinion.  I'm disappointed and bored with the game after just one day.  If I can't get into the game and enjoy it right away, it's not for me.  But this is Star Wars.  I thought George Lucas was the only person who could screw it up.  Turns out Dice/EA have followed suit, making it an overpriced and underwhelming product. (Sorry guys - as much care as you put into it, it's not enough for me).

I plan to take it to a GameStop, or someplace similar, sometime in the next day or so and sell it used and take whatever financial hit it is.  After the horrible feeling from waiting 7 months since pre-order to get this game, I'm just over it.  It wasn't worth it at all.  Now it's time to get a different game that I really wanted (Fallout 4).  I have a feeling I'll enjoy that game a lot more.

But it went terribly wrong with the primary interface. Dungeon maps play like a moving a cloth with a hole in it on a board game map. Towns are just dots on a map where you get to talk to a few people. There's no interactive exploration with the world at all. Just a terribly crude, pre-NES style interface (with PS1 era graphics).

The ""Hardcore"" aspects of the game come from artificial difficulty caused by convoluted and often hidden systems within the game. Little to nothing is explained in game (and the manual covers very little). You'd need a guide for most of this game, but a printed one never existed. Supposedly, Square was putting it up on their website for some reason (I don't know if they got around to it).

I advise skipping this altogether. Especially if you're new to the SaGa series.

Come July/August, Capcom announces the cancellation of Megaman Legends 3 for no reason, and they blame the fans for it getting cancelled. And then they announce ULTIMATE MARVEL VS CAPCOM 3 (it was only a few months since the original game came out at the time, and already another edition?!), which contains some new stages, 12 new crappy characters (None of which are MEGAMAN, which so many people wanted in the game! Gambit, Venom and The Punisher are nowhere to be found either. Instead we get Phoenix Wright, Frank West, Hawkeye and Rocket Raccoon, big whoop), and some new modes, and all of this could've very easily been DLC. But instead, Capcom decides they aren't greedy enough and make a whole new game. And their excuse for not releasing the new stuff as DLC is, get this...the earthquake in Japan....L-A-M-E.

I also enjoy the feeling of making an RPG character my own and truly unique by leveling up the skills I wish as I go.  However, in this game you really can't tell what skills are needed in order to get to the uber-skills you might want to reach in the future.

Horrible voice acting.

A couple of the reviewers have said the graphics are better than Oblivion.  I'm not sure how they can tell.  To keep Gothic III from crashing you have to lower all the graphics settings significantly.

A major on-line reviewer couldn't even get the game to recognize the presence of his mouse - so he had to run the game keyboard only.

I had huge hopes for this game.  I really wanted it to blow Oblivion out of the water.  Not only does it fail to do that, it's an utter mess.  I hope they put out some major patches to fix the most obvious flaws, but does a game this bad ever become even a good game with patches?  I've never seen it.

Don't even buy this game when you see it in the discount bargan bin.",One of the holiday season's biggest disappointments,1164240000,64,,
1.0,True,"12 9, 2010",AY4LUFPU729CF,B002I0J6DC,Spawnie7,"Let me inform you of my bias first in which this review is written. I first have to say I am a HUGE Castlevania fan. I remember as a kid playing the originals on the original NES. Castlevania 2 is the bar of what I believe Castlevania should be. That game is my second favorite video game of all time, and believe me I have been playing for quite awhile. And no God of War is not in my top 5 *Super Metroid, Castlevania 2, Spider-man and Venom: Maximum Carnage, Mario Bros 3, Zelda: A link to the past*. Also I'm only 20% of the way into the first chapter. This game has frustrated me so much I have no burning desire to pick it back up and keep taking whacks at it. And my review is based on the mechanics which shouldn't differentiate from the beginning of the game down to the end.

So let's get the obvious GOW rip offs out of the way. Fighting mechanics. Heavy strike, light strike, dodge, block. Combos can't be interrupted so lots of getting face creamed cuz pushing square once too often starts an unbreakable attack chain. Blah boring! Hate that you can accidentally dodge instead of block. Also the stupid wait til the inner circle lights up mechanic. WTF is that! Why can't I push square or circle like I have to do most of the other time in the game. SO tired of push button action sequences in every game. Another GOW rip off is collecting items where you get health bar upgrade. Come up with something new. No free range within the game. There are times where there is more than one path, however, you do end up at the same spot no matter what. Again like the God of War pre-determined path. Castlevania games should be free range with towns, and castles and woods, and swamps, and you have to explore and fight your way through these zones to accomplish your goals, or possibly wander into a zone that is way too hard for your characters strength and then must return at a later point.

Another thing I have encountered is a 10ft tall enemy who smashes the ground with his fists and creates this dangerous shock wave...seriously something twice my size creates a dangerous shock wave from hitting the ground? Knock those stupid gimmicks out of games. It's just annoying. I can understand in Dante's Inferno when you battle Satan and he does the same thing, however Satan is like 100Ft tall and your character is the size of one of his fingers. That makes more logical sense.

ANYWAY, I do enjoy the graphics and the music. And the story is good so far. However I really hope Konami takes a new whack at the game franchise. Scrap this format and try something new and actually fun. They need fresh ideas, like when Resident Evil 4 changed that franchise and made it fresh. It's the game mechanics, done poorly, which make this game a 1 star.

*****************UPDATE AFTER 3 Chapters in....*************
I don't know how the controller set up on Xbox is but on PS3 as you aquire new abilites, they get crammed into other buttons which already have a predetermined function, IMPORTANT PREDETERMINED FUNCTIONS like DODGE and BLOCK. Don't be surprised if you accidently do something you don't mean to do and get face raped cuz 2 buttons have about 8 abilites tied into it. Seriously why put in some very useless offensive abilites into the button that is your block button? Seems counter intuitive imo. ALSO the ridiculous ground slamming shockwaves continue! Seriously come up with something new, ALL the bosses have this ability along with some of the regular enemies you encounter. Imagine coming across Bigfoot in the wilderness and he's mad at you and he slams his fist into the ground. Do you think he has enough strength to cause a shockwave to take about 20% of your health? Now imagine a big werewolf instead of Bigfoot doing the same. Honestly, whoever designed the controller set up and boss fights don't need to be in the video game industry. They are utter trash at their job. Game is still 1 star in my opinion. Play God of War or Dante's Inferno. At least there is SOME originality and competent game controls. I have played games that I haven't liked but I seriously HATE this game.

***************UPDATE AFTER COMPLETING THE GAME**************
I beat the game on the Knight setting. I am going to have to stick with my 1 star rating. The game offers nothing new in regards to gameplay. Its a badly made GOW set in Castlevania land. I have no idea why the developers decided on such poor controller settings. I don't know how many times I was trying to dodge an attack and accidentally attempted to collect magic orbs. Or how many times I tried to dodge and accidentally performed a worthless gauntlet punch. Also why have such complex combo moves when the key to killing virtually every enemy is hit, dodge, hit, dodge, hit, dodge. Usually every time I attempted to use the complex combos I ended up getting raped. Along with annoying controls and shockwaves, there are times where the camera angle is very poor. The story goes from entertaining enough to predictable. Boss battles really aren't anything to write home about, at times they are just rather annoying. Does anyone really enjoy platforming *jumping to ledge to ledge* from point A to point B even if the boss is a huge titan? This game is definitely worth waiting til it gets cheaper if you are a Castlevania die hard. If you aren't one, you could easily skip over this game altogether and save yourself many moments of frustration, controller throwing, and expletive filled fits. I don't know what difficulty people who gave this game 5 star ratings played, but chances are it was probably on an easy setting, rather than difficult. I would be extremely angry if I paid for full price for this piece of crap game. I see however, that some people will buy any GOW piece of garbage knock off out there, however, I expect more for my $60.

*************SPOILERS AND SPECULATION****************
I think this game is actually a prequel to ALL Castlevania games. First the mask which is the end game objective. I remember masks being very symbolic and common place in early Castlevania games. Second is the change from a pure hearted quest to revenge thus with Gabriel becoming darker and darker. In Castlevania 2, Simon is afflicted with a curse. Curse of the Belmonts having to destroy their family patriarch because he has turned evil and only a Belmont is capable of doing so? Castlevania 3's title is ""Dracula's Curse."" Even Gabriel's outfit reminds me of common Dracula iconography. When you summon Dracula in Castlevania 2, it appears as if he is wearing a mask and after you kill him, Simon digs a grave and buries Dracula. Perhaps burying the family founder? Also in Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dracula is created when a crusader's wife is killed and makes a deal with the devil or something like that. Sounds pretty similar to this game's plot. Finally the game's end scene with Gabriel apparently being a vampire and being called the lord of darkness or something along those lines and him being immortal really points to Gabriel becoming Dracula, thus making this game a prequel.",Big let down,1291852800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Floigan Bros. was announced way back in the day - one of the original announced titles for the DC. It's been in development hell for *years*, and it suffers from a few serious gameplay issues, but more damningly, a complete lack of focus.
The game plot itself is relatively simple. You play as Hoigle Floigan, and your dopey brother Moigle tags along. Moigle is amusing in a very mentally-retarded or idiot-savant kind of way, if you find that sort of thing funny. If you don't, it's probably borderline offensive. Moigle's stupid, Hoigle's too short and weak to be useful.
Moigle needs seven parts to create his little seekrit project, and to get them, he's going to need Hoigle's help. The Brothers own a junkyard, and to screw things up even further, there's an evil guy who wants control of the junkyard, so he throws his cat henchmen down from his blimp to take over. There's no visible motivation for *why* this Baron Malodorous fellow wants the junkyard, he just does. Why are his minions cats? They just are.
""It just *is*,"" might as well be a slogan for this game. Things are arbitrary in a way that's really... bizarre. First of all, you'd think, when you're first shown the seven parts that you need (things like a chimney stack, an engine, a fan, etc.) that these are common things to find in a junkyard. So context-relevant puzzles would seem to make sense. No such luck. You find a fan by blowing up a cat, and you find the chimney stack by having a huge plant barf it up for you. Completely incoherent, illogical solutions to puzzles do not a fun game make. Why is the chimney stack there? It just *is*.
The whole game so far is like this. The design of the gameplay is simply no fun, the AI for the characters is entertaining for about five minutes, the voice samples get old quick, and the game itself, while pretty, is like talking to the Mona Lisa. It may look good, but it's not saying much.
For $5, I'd say ""pick it up."" If you're a completist, you'll have to have it. If you're curious about what they've done with it, it might be worth the [current price] to sate your curiosity. But I was *really* curious, and I feel pretty ripped off.

The 15 version, at least on the PS3, had major issues with freezing and lag, but the game itself was very good.

They changed a lot here - animations look much worse and the pitching is very different.  When there's no lag it's almost ridiculously easy to hit save for perhaps the high fastball.  When there's lag, when there is much of the time, it's almost impossible to hit the fastball. You'll swing and it will be right by you.

You can tell when there is lag for whenever you make contact with the he ball there will be a split second freeze.

Now, baserunning has problems as you have to tap twice to lead off and hold down hard to advance bases.  Way too many errors and passed balls and fielding is way too slow.

Click to play, configuration tool crashes over and over - BAD.

/figure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a 2ndary launcher inbeded in the program files. /successfully launched skipping the configuration tool.

So that was frustrating.

Gameplay - BAD

First issue, Crashes caused by conversations with npcs, which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end, when it first happen windows gave a solution of a Mass Effect 1 Patch - which was easy enough to download and install but DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE...  Its completely RANDOM when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it, sometimes not.  LOL it literally says ""file not found"" and crashes, restart and Presto it works VERY RANDOM but must of restarted me 12+ times.  SAVE before EACH and Every NPC you talk to - to limit annoyance.

Cover system made of fail - pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward, and bad angles.

Item Cap of 150 /fail *blinks* if your already allowing me to carry around 100+items why the heck is there a cap at all?  And sorting the inventory out was a pain.  Games in general need to stop adding Caps like this, FF7 was great and you could hold 99 of everything.

Actual fighting/gameplay a form of torture clunky, clunky, CLUNKY - don't bother with cover its useless.

Land Rover - giggity, whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it.  Its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it, getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down IS NOT FUN.  Which brings me to another point, whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on EVERY planet.  It was INCREDIBLY unfun having to explore with the rover, when it bounces around like a weightless rag-doll on every little bump and don't have enough power to climb a hill.

Elevators - HORRIBLE you'll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides THAT ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN THE GAME.......
its actually a ""thank god"" moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game YEAH ITS THAT BAD... 3-5 minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so FREQUENT.

Sniper rifle wobble - Shepard on some kind of drug?  is he/she not a trained soldier?  Why can't he hold it still?  Even when you get the ability to add 2 25% weapon stability upgrades it's shake is pretty bad...  I'll never understand what was going through their head on this one.  As a amateur hunter i don't have any issue with shaking my gun like I'm hopped up on sugar pops OR WORST...

Story - Wasn't bad.

i think i might of liked it better than Me2, at least the end bad guy wasn't a ridiculous ""HUMAN REAPER"" oh noes!  - why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity.  Which truth be told this series lacks in spades.

Generally Clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersion.

Take note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous length.

It did some things better than Me2

For example every star system you go to has ""something"" to do in it.  But that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets with.

No Ammo was a cool idea, only overheating.

Ability to Sell stuff for Credits - this is good, but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying, and the 150 item cap drove me insane. - I ended with 9,999,999 (max) useless credits.

1.0,True,"02 15, 2013",A3UQJXQUYJILKG,B004L4AZ7Y,Gabriel,"By now, I think most of the people reading this review will have already played Rayman 2. That being the case, not much of Rayman 3D will be a surprise, but that's not why you were looking at this game. You wanted to play one of the best platformers ever made, with all the rich level design, great musical score, and of course, the platforming, as well as the action you expect. Of course you expect that, because this is an adaptation of Rayman 2 for the dreamcast, regarded as one of the best ports of this game (of which there are many, but that's for another discussion)!

So, how can you go wrong? You already know this game. You know it's great, and now you'll know what it's like to play it with enhanced graphics, 3D, and portability, without any compromise to quality like in Rayman DS, or with the somewhat lessened quality of the PS1 port which is now available to play on PS3, PS Vita, and PSP. I'm sure most of you currently know how sarcastic I'm being, because this 3DS port is not nearly as flawless as one would think.

The things that ruin this game probably sound nitpicky to an outsider. Even I tried to resolve to deal with the negative because of how much I love Rayman 2. The fact of the matter is, most of them are technical. Rayman 2 is still a great game, and you can experience the PC version for reasonably cheap. But on the 3DS, Rayman 2 looks a little broken. Not much like its normal self, this version of Rayman 2 is full of glitches, framerate issues, even things as small as sound issues. Anyone who has played the original game at length would immediately spot these problems.

Let me describe to you an experience I had just moments ago. I was just playing the second level of the game, The Fairy Glade as it's called. The first thing I notice is that in the starting area, the framerate is all over the place. From silky smooth to what I'd have to guess is 15fps. If you don't know what that means, just trust me, it's not good. After progressing a bit, I come upon a giant machine pumping sludge into a river. I climb up into this machine and walk through it like normal, like in the original game, but something is off. Upon further examination, it turned out that most of the inner walls of this machine were invisible from the inside. If you go to first person view mode from within and look outward, the entire thing disappears and you can see parts of the map you were never supposed to. After marveling at the lack of playtesting, I moved along to another area with a large waterfall, another river, vines along a cliff side, and jumping pirhannas. Remarkably, this area seems relatively okay except for the framerate being kinda slow. As I make it to the other side safely, I peer back over to the vines I had just climbed across and notice that one of the pirhannas is frozen in mid air. Actually, I don't recall there ever being a pirhanna there to begin with. Just a random one, floating, completely still, like someone edited it in and forgot to delete it. At about this point, I turned off the game because I was disgusted.

There are numerous other glitches. In one level, you look upward and see that there are two skies. One of them is not supposed to be there, the other, clipped off at the cliff side for some reason. In another level, you free your friend ""Ssssam"" from a cage, but strangely enough, there are two of them! One of them is a fake, the other one can be used to traverse the level like normal. In some areas, in 3D, you can actually see through walls and such. Then there are less cosmetic issues. In The Iron Hills, you start out in an area that is downpouring so hard that it's effecting all the 2D objects in the area! Your shadow, your hair, lums, smoke, all sorts of things are barely visible because every raindrop that intersects them makes it disappear. If you like hunting for lums in that area, you'll only be slightly worse off finding them with your eyes closed. Speaking of which, this brings me to one glitch I haven't even encountered but everyone has talked about. The 1000th lum glitch! Apparently, there's a secret area in the game where you can find the very last, 1000th lum, but unfortunately, the method you use to get to it in the normal versions of the game is broken in this one. It involves a web hammock that you use as a trampoline, except, it doesn't bounce you at all, it just pretends like it's a platform. This makes getting to the lum almost impossible, unless you do some kind of convoluted technique of getting shot by an enemy or something, which hopefully bounces you high enough to get up to the ledge you need to get to to snag the lum. So, great, you can't even really beat the game by collecting all the lums. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the audio is screwed up too. Unless you turn your music down to about 10%, good luck hearing sound effects even when they're on max. Other issues I've heard of include music switching abruptly, some dialogue not being spoken or spoken strangely or out of sync, etc. I can go on listing off glitches, but I think you get the point.

Basically, Rayman 3D is a bad port of an awesome game, and doesn't deserve this treatment. If you want to play the real Rayman 2, it's available on GOG for less than $10, with some bonus content, and it plays natively in HD (and still looks surprisingly good at 1080p). If you have any computer that's less than 5 years old, I can almost guarantee you it'll run great, and older computers will probably perform just as well too. If you still have a Dreamcast, try and find that version of the game, because people love it and it's got some neat little extras that the PS1, PC, and N64 versions didn't have. This version just isn't worth your money, and no matter how many dimensions they add, it'll still be a terrible port.",I hope you like glitches!,1360886400,5,,

Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!

For those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!

Plot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.

Characters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. ""Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs.""

Gameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a ""singer"" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.

Music: *gag*

Overall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one. If you buy it, I very much hope you are only buying it to melt it into unrecognizable plastic so it can be recycled.

I wrote Traveller's Tales about the game, stating that I would never buy another Lego videogame and received no response. Also never got any response from Warner Bros.

All the raves of the other good reviews will give you advice on this games strengths, of which there are many.

However, don't buy it on the 360.  PLEASE, save yourself the headaches and get it on a PC!!!

I've had Oblivion for a little over two months now, and my Xbox 360 can barely play this game.  It is full of bugs.  I've returned it twice and am on my third disk, so I know it's not an errors on the disk itself.  It's just tons and tons of software glitches on the import from PC to 360 (which is funny since the 360 is just a PC in a pretty case).  Three of my close friends are all playing the 360 version as well, and they're all having the same problems I'm having.

There are plenty of downloadable features (The Orary, the horse barding, priate ship, etc.), and these seem to have a negative effect on the software and cause a lot of trouble.  However, I didn't donwload any of this, and my game is rife with bugs.  If you go to Bethesda's forums, you can read tons and tons of posts discussing these problems (you might even find me there!).  But I'll sum them up for you.

1) The game freezes constantly.  I think it has something to do with the DVD drive trying to load sounds and locking up.

2) ""Unreadable Disk Errors"" are VERY common.  The game will pause, go black, and give this type of errors.  Some times it even says to remove the disk and put in a game designed for the 360!

3) Strange loads.  Sometimes, you'll load saved files and appear in the world paralized and halfway inside of your avatar.

Bethesda is no help with any of these problems.  On the forums many people have posted their customer support replies, and they're all the most generic, ""I'm not listening,"" plug your ears and hum responses I've ever read.

As I've said this is one of the best games in a generation.  But stick with the PC.

The game had potential, but it was simply over hyped and didn't live up to its potential in any way. The fact that they claimed a balanced game with nearly a 50% win/loss rate for both hunters and monsters is laughable. Online I have a 100% win rate with Goliath almost always stomping the hunters in stage2 with very little difficulty. So far while playing the hunters I think I have something like a 90% loss rate. The Player trackers seem to have an extremely difficult time actually finding and tracking the Monster, meaning we typically do very little until the final battle which the monster generally initiates in phase 2 or phase 3. Most online players I have played with pugging seem to not be very good, trappers almost never trap, trackers seem to not track very well, healers rarely heal. The actual game play is absolutely nothing like seen in the youtube video's where everyone puts up a good fight. Unless you capture the monsters in phase 1 the hunters pretty much don't stand a chance. If you actually played with the same 4 hunters every single game, and every one of you knew what you were doing, then maybe it could be ok.

I WANTED to enjoy this game - I tried so hard.  I tweaked driving settings as some suggested, I tried ""just driving around"" as others suggested, and I tried drinking myself into a stupor until ANTYHING was fun.  Licking the inside of the beer bottle is still more interesting than anything you'll experience in ""The Crew"" by Ubisoft.
This game is just simply awful.  First and foremost is the terrible driving physics.  Bump a wall, spin 180 degrees.  Round a corner and stomp on the gas, no problem.  Round the next corner and stomp on the gas, spin horredly out of control.  Pop over a curb to take a short-cut, spin out of control.  And FORGET steering the car on anything but a road surface because sand/grass/dirt all act like ice from the movie Frozen, which I've seen 100 times and still enjoy more than this game.
I was excited when I saw the depth of customization options in The Crew.  With my new Challenger in the shop, I was quite impressed with the range of hoods, headlights, bumpers, etc.  Then I got a new Camaro, and quickly realized that all of its mods looked EXACTLY the same.  With such a small list of cars available, youd think they would have time to add some unique mods to each of them.
Also laughable is the upgrade system.  You don't actually buy upgrades for your cars.  You earn new parts by doing missions or events.  Each part offers a boost to your vehicle but the boosted attribute is randomly selected upon award of the part.  And get this  the boost often has nothing to do with the part you're awarded.  Get an ECU part, and it might boost traction.  Get a new suspension part, and you might get a boost to top speed.  WTF?!
The game tries to find diversity in both its missions and skill events.  Missions are typically races, but every once in a while youll be trying to elude cops (or hitmen,) delivering a car, or placed in a specialty vehicle to chase someone down, or my personal favorite, test it out for me and tell me what it can do  Im sorry  you're supposedly a ranked member of a racing gang, and you need ME, an indentured spy trying to infiltrate your organization, to test out your car??
Now lets not forget  Ubisoft did just as miserable of a job with their first Assassins Creed game.  In fact, the similarities are somewhat shocking.  Remember the side missions in Assassins Creed where you had to help a fellow Assassin member kill a target because his legs were tired and he had other things to do??
And so I have to imagine that the folks who made The Crew were a bunch of up-and-comers in Ubisoft who had absolutely no idea what they were doing and probably never operated a motor vehicle.  They obviously have no idea how cars work, nor what makes a game interesting, fun, or engaging.  HOWEVER, if Ubisoft has proven anything, its that by the 3rd or 4th time around, theyll finally get it right, and then brow-beat the idea straight into the boredom pile.  Hey, the fourth game sold like crazy, so copy and paste it to a 5th game, and well make another few million dollars!

1. The biggest reason I am so disappointed in D3 is the Real Money Auction House (RMAH).  I knew it was going to be in the game, but the thought didn't bother me.  I've never planned to purchase items or gold with real money.  The major problem is that Blizzard has seen fit to design the game so that you will NEED to purchase items and gold from the AH in order to progress without some maddening gear grind that would take a lifetime. In short, they have set the game up to require use of the AH, in order to profit from the resultant transaction fees.

2. Absolutely terrible online service. This game is required to be connected to the internet at all times while playing, but the company has provided sub-standard service that results in frequent disconnects, server downtime, and constant gameplay lag.

Civ IV took all the depth, joy and complexity of Civ III stripped it down, shot it and buried it in the woods. Games go by far too fast without anything of consequence happening. The adviser panel was replaced by menu screens that provided no real helpful information. Religion is introduced without consequence or purpose, resources have no real significance, your government might as well not exist because the social policies don't really effect the flow of the game and worst of all, the AI is unbearable.

Civ IV's AI is the only AI that I've ever know that was based upon high school girls. No matter what you do, you are not part of the club, the AI will never love you. You have one AI friend and that only because she wasn't good enough to get invited to the cool girls table either. You'll form a bond with your AI friend but the mean AI at the cool girls table with be plotting against you. They will try to ruin your friendship because they know how much you want to be part of the clique. So you'll try and try to win their approval and just somehow suspiciously 2 votes short of winning the diplomatic victory. And maybe you won't fall for it. Maybe your values will prevail but you still can't beat the cool girls because if you take on one they will all fight you and then your life, prom and hopes for a conquest victory die like your dreams of college.

Ugh. Where was I? I'm sorry, my therapist tells me I'm on the verge of a break through.

I should say the game is almost playable with the Beyond the Sword expansion pack. Almost. You get random events that happen and can have an effect on the game and the AI's unity will start to fray but come to naught.  Much like it did at when Jake asked Lisa to the prom and Mongolia was all like, ""You b*tch I'm going to make your life a hell."" and then because there was only two weeks left in school she just didn't.

But honestly, as almost barely tolerable as Beyond the Sword is, it is nothing compared to CIV V. Civ V was really a breath of fresh air. It was a break with the past, it was stylish, sleek and bold.

1.0,False,"08 31, 2009",AYAS7V5UY9FRZ,B0012N94WO,saeed,"I had great expectations when I first saw the videos and heard the news on the new resident evil game for I have been a huge fan of the series, especially RE2 and RE Code Veronica (Best RE of all time!!!). RE 4 had already been disappointing some years ago, with all that action and no puzzles and shock moments implented anymore.
Well, and after playing the RE 5 Demo several times, here are my first impressions:

- an UNBELIEVABLE LONG loading time. I actually went to the bathroom, got me something to drink, checked my mails, then I got to play. That really has to change until the launch of the game, but i doubt it.
- chrashed several times, very unstable. hopefully that is just an error as to the demo and not the full game.
- graphics are really stunning as to the sourroundings (africa in far cry 2 looked better, but it is still great) and characters. the zombies look kinda weird. and after you killed them they disappear in some sort of bubbles, looked like house of the dead, looked really silly.
- the BIGGEST flaw: this DAMN CO-OP mode!!! Don'T get me wrong, playing co-op with a friend is kewl, although the splitscreen was implented in a weird way in the corners of the screen, but okay. but if you are a solo player you are stuck with your miserable A.I. partner that ALWAYS runs in front of you, around you, 2cm away from your nose like a bee anxious to get some honey. it is SOO annoying. and it does not matter in the least if you are doing everything the right way, meaning giving her ammunition, herbs, covering, etc, she dies, and THAT happens a lot. And THAT means: GAME OVER!!! I want to play RE, I want to die and I want to finish the game with MY skills, not with some screwed up A.I. figure that can'T even walk right.
- the sound is okay as long as you just focus on the surroundings and the zombie sounds. the weapon sounds are some of the lamest sounds I have EVER heard in a game.
- Difficulty: well, the past RE games have always been easy in the beginning and sometimes got really hard during the game and especially in the end with defeating the final boss. but now: SINCE WHEN does a zombie NOT DIE when you shot him directly in the head? with your pistol u have to shoot at last 2 times in the head or 4-5 at the body of the zombie to kill him. and considering that you got much less ammo than EVER in a RE game this is pretty annoying.

Overall I am very very angry, sad and disappointed and immediately cancelled my pre-order. First I wanna see how the final game looks like and which of those flaws have been erased, but I fear there won't be much done about it. If it costs 10 some time in the future I guess you can buy it.

1.0,False,"11 17, 2010",AJ8VUUCO9RMX6,B003R3JNN2,D.L.,"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.

You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.

The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.

I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.  There is a couple of months for the developer to correct their mistakes before the second part of this game is released in July of 2011 but I'm not holding my breath.",Stupified!,1289952000,40,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

However, as I opened the box (not the one from Amazon, but the actual Thrustmaster box) I realized there were small plastic pieces laying around. I realized the wheel was poorly packaged and therefore there was a crack on the plastic with a hole above it. Not big deal really, yes it was broken but I wouldn't return it just for that. However after I installed the drivers I realized (on the windows test screen) that the brake pedal is completely dead. I did my best around re-installing drivers, looking for updates for drivers, nothing changed (of course it wouldn't, the drivers were just right the first time).

Then to top it off, 2 out of the 3 racing games that I tried the wheel on didn't work right away. In both Need for Speeds the wheel was working fine through the menus but not in the actual race. So while I'm sure I could've found a solution with some research, I decided to re-pack the wheel and send it for a exchange due to the defective pedal and broken steering wheel plastic.

So yeah, I'll update once I receive the new one, however having a 1) Broken product due to Poor Packaging; 2)Defective Item, and 3)Not completely compatible even with good driver installation/update; pretty much covers everysingle thing that could go wrong with a product from the customer side.","Defective, poorly packaging caused dmg NOT plug&play for PC",1325721600,,,

Today when I was just about to finish it, I wanted to give this game 3 stars.
Why only 3? Because of the MANY bugs(even after the 1.02 patch and a legit copy of the game) I was shocked to discover. So many technical issues, in some movies the sound wouldn't play, sam passing through doors, enemies getting stuck in invisible walls, problems with the resolution, with the V-synch and many others. Also the noise and light/darkness system is gone. Now Sam's got some kinda incorporated gadget that turns green when you are invisible to enemies, yellow when they can see you and red when they sound the alarm.

*SPOILER ALERT*
But after I disarmed the bomb(last level), instead of showing me the movie, the screen FROZE. loaded the game many times, many different settings, no luck. I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE ENDING SCENE.
AND THERE'S MORE
I had 100% NSA trust, which means you ""should"" play a bonus level. Well...I couldn't do that either. Had to watch it on youtube. Such a shame
From 3 stars, I would now give this game 0 stars, but amazon only has a minimum of 1. Ok
*SPOILER ALERT OFF*

Also, as a funny thing I saw in the credits(on youtube) , 90% of the production crew was chinese. This game is made in China. At least that's what the quality tells me.

Anyways
Pros: Good storyline, amazing sountracks, pretty good graphics when they're not failing
Cons: Tons of bugs, VERY SHORT(Has about 6 levels), kinda easy.

The server problems are even more severe than during the beta test a few weeks ago; the US servers crashed soon after release and haven't yet been brought back online... a sad situation for a company that has been making its living online with their recent (huge) releases.  Nevertheless, a few hours of gameplay gave me a fair impression of the game; it's moderately fun but not really challenging or rewarding.
You run around on linear missions slaughtering easy hoards and a few bosses.  It was great fun in Diablo and Diablo II (both of which I still play occassionally), but uninspired this time around.  As you level up, you can't really customize your characters because there aren't any skill trees (leveling up seems to only unlock predefined skills).  Blizzard does allow you some customization... you can pick the design and color of your banners! FUN!  Like everybody else, I haven't had much play time because of Blizzard's server issues, but it appears that the game doesn't spawn new or different enemies as you take different characters through acts.
The real purpose of the game seems to be connecting players to the auction houses.  Blizzard won't let you play without being connected to their servers because ""you might want to visit the auction house"".  The main motivation to visit the auction house appears to be to try to get something, anything, to make your character unique because there certainly isn't anything that you're going to pick up in the early levels that is unique, the NPC merchants have nothing to offer, and the absence of skill trees results in boring, stock characters.
Wait a few months.  When the price drops to 30% of its current level it might be a worthwhile investment, but at the current price it is a real rip-off.
UPDATE...  Blizzard keeps tweaking the game, which should lead to an improved experience, but it doesn't.  While the servers have stabilized, the game play has gotten worse. The game has gone from being ridiculously easy to insanely difficult. Suddenly the monsters surround your character so there is no escape and they can kill you with two blows. I went from never dying in the first week of release to now dying almost every time I respawn.  There's no enjoyment in either extreme.
Again, I loved the first two Diablo games but I'm growing to hate this one.  I'm about ready to uninstall the game and accept that Blizzard simply ripped me off.

If you want a plot that works, make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes, but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done, and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd, and make the story alter entirely.  Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town, solve the puzzle, hear a bunch of drivel that doesn't add up to anything else in your head, get the item and build a new town.  The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played, but what did that have to do with anything.

This is an example of a good nonlinear plot:

You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord. The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord (base plot).  Now as you set out, you're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident. You get arrested for animal cruelty, and put in prison.  So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free, and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes, that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses, so under her tutelage, you become a career criminal.

 But the Playstation 2 version? Guess what? This is NOT the Sims2.

No matter what the title may be, this is an unbelievable farce.

Let me tell you this for a fact; Sims 2 on PS2 is complete rubbish. There have been plenty of products that I have ridiculed on Amazon but I have always been aware that they are only my opinions and everyone has different tastes.

But I want anyone who is considering this game to know that what I am telling you about it is not an opinion. It is a straight fact. This game is... (a word Amazon will probably block, that starts with c and ends with p and has 4 letters)

It is nothing like the real Sims 2, and it is less interesting than any other SIms game ever.

The Create A Sim area involves a few small drawings of tops, skirts and pants. Apparently you can be a fashion designer! Oh sure, long sleeves or short sleeves?Collar up or collar down?How exciting.

The body and face maker is lesser than even the first Sims, you won't be able to see what you are doing anyway and no matter how you ""morph"" them, they stay looking the same. Plus, they don't even look real. They are ugly.

Story mode?Forget it. How fun it is to fulfill your sims needs that include Take A Shower. (Not!)

All while your ridiculous looking sim runs around like a lunatic as the useless creation that it is.

Free play mode?What the hell?? The SIms 2 is supposed to be about creating family trees. They can not even have children!!!

There are about 2 familes (but they aren't really families, there are no actual families) and there's space for you to create two more lots of roommates.

The build mode looked like a migrainne, while the buy mode was absolutely pathetic, with teensy child-like drawings. Very few too.

Thsi game is expensive but reeks of amateurishness. You will have more fun with a 2 dollar toy.

(And please note that this review is coming from an extreme Sims fan)

Maxis needs to aplogize to anyone who waited for The Sims 2 to come to console, and anyone who spent money for or recieved this ghastly piece of cow dung.

I have really really liked the Maxis gang for a while, very grateful for what they have done with the original Sims 2.

But now, Maxis, you owe us. Big time. To start with, can I have my money back?

It baffles me why they have made such an honestly horrible game. Do not buy it!

If you have been dying to play the Sims 2, I suggest the computer game. I know it has steep system requirements but I managed to purchase a new computer and I don't have much money. SO it can be done, if you want the (real) SIms 2 as badly as I did.

The computer game is truly fantastic but the console version is a nightmare created in the bowels of Hell.","MAXIS, Why did you do this????",1130889600,126,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Mostly they just lose them, so we decided to buy the first headphones we've bought in a long time.  I showed the kids the headphones before I ordered them, and they were ecstatic!  The headphones cancel out distractions in a busy house/car, and we (the parents) like that they are more hygienic and harder to misplace.

I ordered one each of the Amazon Basic and the Sony MDRZX100, at essentially the same price.  I received both at the same time, and I couldn't believe what I saw.  The Amazon headphones look like the ones you get at the dollar store.  The head pad is just cheap foam, and the ear pads are simply glued in place.  To me, the biggest indicator of the poor quality was the cables.  Amazon cuts off the photo right where the cables get very thin--about 1/4 as thick as Sony.  If the Amazon headphones hadn't literally fallen to pieces within a few days of ordinary use, I was quite certain the tiny cables would have frayed in less than a month.  As it happened, the ear pads were the first to go.  They show absolutely no signs of wear; they just came apart where they were shoddily glued on.

So, help me out here, Amazon.  I love shopping on here!  I especially love the user ratings--when they are based on product use rather than nostalgia.

Just so you get the right idea:
1) You cannot play this game with anything but the wiimote + nunchuck.
2) The nunchuck's accelerometer is the single most used control in the game
3) Reread #2. If you honestly don't understand why its so bad that the single most important function of the game - accurate dodging - is using the s***tier accelerometer in your non-dominant hand, you don't know anything about fighting games.
4) Holy crap. This entire game is hack and slash with dodging. If dodging were actually capable of being done accurately. But I digress on the dodging. Your right arm will fall off. There is simply nothing to do, you just walk, avoid stupid obstacles (like blind-corner rolling boulders LOLOL so much fun!) and flail your right arm around like a lunatic.
5) The designers of this game thought a good way to design boss fights was to make bosses have toggle-able invincibility. Let me explain how this works. Whenever you get close enough to attack a boss, they will become invincible and all your attacks will be repelled. I'm not even kidding either. That's actually what you will face if you buy this game and attempt to play it. You will literally be sitting on your couch, trying to clear a boss fight, carefully dodge all the boss' abilities (or at least attempt to, see #2), and then run up to him and start flailing your right arm, only to hear the ""parry"" sound and notice you did absolutely nothing.

1.0,False,"01 15, 2012",A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B000TGB4SM,Nishi,"I have played a lot of games before, and even if a game is bad I try and finish it because I would like to see what happens at the end of the game. I wanted to play this game because I really liked the movie and I was curious what happened between the 30 years in the movie, like the game says you can play through. After shortly playing through it, I just gave up playing it, it wasn't even worth it to try and suck it up to see the ending.

To begin with the graphics are not that great, I know it's a 2007 game, but Final Fantasy 10 had better graphics than this game, hell some psp games have better graphics. I don't mind graphics in a game, if that game is good. The story is changed a bit from the movie, and some weapons he use changes. (*minor spoiler* i.e. The sea monster`s horn instead of a sword). Weapons break way to fast, but in its defense you run into them a lot.

The fighting is ok in this game, but I have played others that have a better fighting system. The only good thing about this game is the bloody kills, and finishing moves. No dismemberment though. You get ""power-ups"" throughout the game, but I only got two of them so far in the game. One makes you powerful, and the other makes your party powerful. If your ""party"" dies its game over and your hits hurt them too, and they get in the way all the time so you end up killing them. The grendle part is the part your party members can die.

The game leans heavily on Quick Time Events and I tend to hate these types of gameplay. Some games do it well, but some make it extremely annoying, i.e. this game.  They even have a music Quick Time Event, but its more annoying than anything. The only cool part was the song Beowulf sung to bring out Grendel.

Overall this game is trying to be a God of War game with Beowulf instead of Kratos, but it failed horribly. I got the game and the movie for 4 dollars together at a sale at Wal-Mart, so I didn't lose that much on it since I really liked the Beowulf movie. I do feel bad for the people who bought this at retail price just to find out how much this game sucks, save your money for another game.

Length: I didn't complete the game because it was so bad, so I don't know the length.

Trophies / Achievements: I don't know its achievements due to playing it on the PC, and I don't recommend trying for them since it would be a very painful process.

I've had Sim City 2000, Sim City 4 Deluxe, recently got back into playing these types of games (Tropico, Port Royal, etc.) couldn't find my disk for Sim City 4, didn't even KNOW a ""new version"" had come out. Saw ads for Cities XXL via ""Steam"" (evidently far superior) but really don't WANT nor see any reason for online/multiplayer interaction for a game like this via a subscription based internet/cloud account and game server. Even the guy at the big box store I purchased this from, when I asked about the ""dedicated internet connection required"" he SWORE that he owned the game himself, and while initially it required the dedicated connection, I could NOW play the game without. NOT TRUE!!!!

TOO anxious for the latest and greatest version of one of my all-time favorite games to research reviews until after I'd purchased, and guess what? ALL the reviews are horrible due to the exact reasons I hate it!

You HAVE to install ""Origin"" (like ""steam"" an online game server app-think of games like Xbox live or Wizard 101) and set up an online account/profile in order to get the game??? I don't WANT to play with other people, I want to build and work on MY city myself, just like in Sim City 4. I want to be able to play even if my internet is down (as would anyone wanting to play the game who doesn't have high speed internet to begin with).

So, I was already angry, but gave in and started jumping through hoops (opting NOT to let Origin run at startup,collect offline data, etc. =the default settings). Loaded everything, clicked on ""Play"" via the Origin ""my games"" tab (internet based), nothing happened AT ALL. I have a Windows 7 pc, Phenom quad core processor, 8 gb ram, 2mb dedicated graphics, high speed internet, NO reason it should'n't have launched. Clicked the ""task manager"" and guess what? The ""Origin"" app itself was hogging over 93 mb of resources, and Sim City (trying to launch) only took 63mb, but COULDN'T launch due to ""Origin"" (or the game servers). This is why every single review of the product says to avoid it at all costs-servers crash, and performance is hindered because of being an internet based game.

I finally got it to launch after a few attempts, then, after nearly a half an hour of 'updating', a few restarts, it finally worked! Well, since the game is internet based and they do a test to adjust your settings, I pretty much ended up having the same graphics I had with Sim City 4, albeit *slightly* smoother and no more funky, intertwined roads. Doing the tutorial, I did discover that you apparently no longer need to do all the manual placement of underground water or power lines, which is a plus, I guess?

While I've just started playing, but due to the game lag, and my graphics quality all 'automatically adjusted' to ""LOW"" by Origin (thus giving me the same graphics Sim City 4 had, or at least only very slightly better) while I've been anxiously looking forward to playing, I gave up halfway through the tutorial. I know that's not fair, but it's true. This will be uninstalled and go in the ""forget"" pile (Like Port Royale 3 did) and I'll dig out my version of Sim CIty 4 again.","MUST install ""Origin"" (Internet game server software) settings adjusted for online play- NOT a ""standalone"" game.",1426982400,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

That being said...This game (Silent Hill Homecoming)coming out for me was a HUGE deal! Again HUGE deal! Flash back to the year 2005, it could have been 2004, whenever Silent Hill 4 came out.

  My best friend and I were in our senior year of high school (Thank God it's FINALLY OVER!!!) and both worked 25 hours a week, 5 days a week at our part time jobs. That being said we had little time for anything outside of work or school. My friend had played around with Silent Hill 1 and 2 and he had seen me beat the first and second Silent Hill over at his parents' house. Also, he helped me with the third one. So Silent Hill 4 came out and we proposed it should be a joint venture all the way. So he got the game and the guide and what ensued was many wonderful Saturday nights, or whenever we could squeeze it in after school, cussing and yelling at the TV, eating cheetos and caramel popcorn, drinking way too much soda, all the while having the house to ourselves and playing this game with his 14 year old brother. He helped out, so it was cool. To say we had a blast would be an understatement!

  Now skip ahead...about 4 years. We had both been jonesing to play a new Silent Hill game together for a long time, so it was another Saturday night and we headed to the store and loaded up on munchies and soda so that we'd be ready to go. No amount of soda, junk food, or good spirit could prepare us for the living Hell we were about to waste our Saturday night on!

  First, off. The story is stupid. THIS IS REALLY NOT A JOKE! You are left not really caring about any of the characters and you don't really feel a need to play through this game to help them get to the bottom of their issues and find out what is going on. In the first Silent Hill, I WANTED to help Harry find his daughter. The second Silent Hill,I WANTED to help James find his wife and discover what was going on.

 The characters are so stupid and unenthusiastic about anything going on in the game! (I really can't blame them, either!) I mean really, everyone in the town is missing and [...] off monsters are roaming the streets. Let's go post missing posters! That's exactly what your love interest in the game does. Time to reconsider...there are other fish in the sea.

  Also, I want some of whatever the main character's mom in the game is on. You see, when you tell your mom your brother is missing, she sits there and says something like,""Oh are you going to go look for him? Come back soon!""  Remember Maria telling James they had to find Laura in Silent Hill 2? That was intense and filled with emotion. This, no.

  Second, the combat sucks. Just SUCKS! You have to role many times and rolling doesn't work a lot. You still get hit. Swinging a bat or another large weapon is likely to make you sit there and pee your pants in frustration as your character misses time and time again.  So what are you to do? Your best bet is to try to stab everything in the game to death with the quickest weapon in the game, the knife. (Which just so happens to be the weakest weapon.) This means you get your A** kicked many many times.

  Third, I HATE the menus. They are in a stupid circle pattern which means twice my friend and I accidentally bumped the control stick with a
millimeter of our thumb and accidentally ended up using much needed health items when we were trying to use another item. You see, in this game, one tap of the X button or whatever and it uses that selected item.

  I miss the old menus that were a straight line that you could cycle through, stop at the item you wanted, hit a button, and it asked you if you wanted to use that item.

  Fourth, the levels blow! After trudging through, some crap like a sewer level and a hotel, which a mutual friend who's also TOTALLY into Silent Hill, said looked A LOT like the Hotel in Silent Hill the Movie, we were coming to a new area...My friend was done being frustrated and said,"" If I see a coal, mine, I'm done..."" Low and behold, it was a coal mine with a fire below it! Wow, kind of like the movie!

  Fifth, TOO MANY [...] enemies. With the sewer levels, I was being charged at by like 5 or 6 white things that looked like a big headed praying mantis alien thing. Also, I went to a Dr.'s office to find like 8 nurses in there. (No, that is not an exaggeration!) After being killed numerous times, I ended up rolling, which I died a couple times doing that, too, to get through that doctor's office.

  Also, there is this stupid enemy who you can ONLY shoot in the bright, multi-colored, glowing pouch thing (THAT'S RIGHT. THE ENEMIES IN A SILENT HILL GAME NOW HAVE RAINBOW COLORS!!!) because he breathes smog at you if you get too close. Totally waste of ammo! Also, speaking of ammo, there isn't enough of it in the game! So your only option is to run away from everything and hope you survive! Which you most likely won't! Believe me, I tried!...Numerous times...

  Sixth, damn the bosses to hell! I was fighting this doll thing and kept dying because of this stupid level design, that placed a huge fan above you so that you have a huge shadow of a fan projecting down on you, while trying to roll around in a dimly lit area and hit this boss. Rolling, surprisingly didn't work here either, as we kept getting hit by this long armed retard! And since there wasn't enough ammo in the game and we had used up much needed health items (We couldn't get more anyway, because there's like a total of 4 in the whole game) we were left using our, approximately, 6 remaining bullets on the boss and then whacking it to death with a pipe for about AGAIN and AGAIN FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF!!! Every time we kept dying we were FORCED TO WATCH THE SAME CUTSCENE over and over before the boss battle because there was no way to skip it! Finally, my friend spiked his wireless controller across the room. The controller bounced off the floor and the battery pack went flying.

  SERIOUSLY, I felt like CRYING after trying to play this game. The next morning, after playing this game, I felt like I had been punched in the stomach because I was SOOOOOOOO bummed out over how bad this game sucked.  I am someone who can find something good about almost any game, not matter how bad, that makes it worth trying or playing through. This is the exception to that previous statement.

  My friend and I both TOTALLY hated this game! In fact, I asked my  friend to look up what to do in the game guide and he joked,"" You turn the page and it's a white page that says,"" This game sucks! We gave up on writing a guide for it."" Also, our mutual friend previously mentioned, ACTUALLy beat this game...and drum roll... HATED IT!!! Really, this game should have never been made! Konami is laughing all the way to the bank on this one. And is it really any wonder why this wasn't released in Japan, like the previous titles?

  And please don't try to tell me, I didn't like this game because I had grown and changed since Silent Hill 4 came out! That's bunk! I played, liked, and was very satisfied with Silent Hill: Origins. So I have nothing against new entries to the series, even if they are made by a new developer. This could've come out a month after Silent Hill 4 and I still would've hated it for the same reasons above.

  I don't currently have a PS3 or X-Box 360, but if I ever do get one, I might pick this game up if it were about $10. No rush to look though. I have a small urge to try again, but believe me...I wouldn't shed one tear if it was ten years or more until I got to play this game again.

  It sucked playing this so bad, because it shattered many great memories of enjoying the Silent Hill series. Really, if this is the future of the Silent Hill game series, I'd rather have no more games released in the series, and Silent Hill naturally fading away from our memories and dying with it's glory and reputation still intact. It's hard for me to write that, but it needs to be said.

  Overall, this game was as much fun as hearing about or watching a story on TV about a parent dying while trying to save their children. No, that's not a joke and it's not meant to be funny.

The problem is, in order to play it, you have to use this program called Steam. Steam is an attack on consumers' rights to control and access the content we pay for. Allow me to explain why this is.

I purchased a game and I want to play it online at my buddy Joe's server. No problem, right? I can just load up the game, type in Joe's IP address and have fun... or not. This program Steam requires you to contact the game publisher's server to even start the game, and it is too busy to accommodate the traffic. There is an ""offline mode"", but it frequently fails to work, delivering cryptic error messages.

So, we have a completely unnecessary, slow, advertisement-infested piece of software preventing us from using our game we rightfully paid for.

It seems that Activision released this without adequate testing (if they tested it at all on systems other than the one owned by the guy who wrote it and maybe his mom's computer). The Web is replete with stories about how to fix the audio bug-- although there's no official patch on Activision's website, and the only thing at ""prototypegame.com"" is an advertisement for the sequel. The unofficial fixes require changing component settings and removing HID devices from the Device Manager-- drastic steps which I haven't seen recommended since the days of DOS and various incompatable video standards.

I've completed the first part, which seems to be a flash-forward scene. You click various buttons and do various things, none of which are really different from any other combination of clicks. Some seem to do damage in a wide range, others directly ahead of you. It doesn't matter. Just whale on the buttons.

You can run up buildings, which is cool a couple of times, until you realize there's no point to doing that (except perhaps to escape the chaos of Times Square). There's nothing on the rooftops except generic 1990s-looking textures. Fortunately you can fall any distance without injury.

The sluggishness of the game is confusing. It'll become unresponsive at odd times, and menus are nearly unmanagable, because of the really poorly designed screens and cursor. The menu screens are almost all black, and the mouse cursor is red-- which any freshman design student can tell you is a bad choice, being invisible to a large part of the population (yes, myself included) and hard to see for the rest. Furthermore, the mouse cursor jumps about by fits and starts-- if it was smoother, perhaps you could figure out where it was, but that's not really an option. You'll have to use the keyboard.

I suppose that you could have fun with this, smashing the same cars and beating up the same passers-by (textures are very limited and everything looks like everything else) while growing tentacles out of your body, but the appeal of that is limited for me. I got a little leery. Your first mission is to kill lots of soldiers. Why? OK, they killed some mutants and a girl that might have been infected, but about halfway through I paused and asked ""OK, why am I killing soldiers? Why am I not killing the icky mutants that are attacking innocent passers-by who all look the same?"" If it had been adequately described-- i.e. if there had been a writer attached to this project-- maybe I would have gone ahead and not felt like I was a super-powered terrorist. I know the basics of the story from the box description, but it's rather turgid and inconsistent. And it really should be assumed that the player starts from ground zero-- knowing nothing and learning things through play.

If you want a good third-person shooter, pick up the Mass Effect games. If you want a really good first-person shooter, invest in Deus Ex (three installments, all of which rock). If you want an extraordinary action story set in a unique environment, get Bioshock I and II (the sequel is nearly as good as the original and has better controls). If you want to see tentacles growing out of someone's body-- well, Japanese video has lots of that. If you like changing all the options on your system to suit one game that isn't a whole lot of fun, THEN try Prototype.",Might be a decent game if it actiually worked,1329004800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I'll start this off, I bought this to hold me till reach comes out.  Everyone back in july and may were saying this game was great.  Don't buy into the hype.  I promise you if this wasn't made by rockstar it would've gotten horrible reviews.  Everything about this game is good except WHAT TRULY MATTERS IN A GAME!

There is nothing to this games free world, no destruction, no chaos to create beyond textbook GTA stuff and almost no sense of freedom besides tapping A for 10 minutes then in the singleplayer the horses are slow enough as it is so during quests you will have to hold A so your horse follows your friends who have no sense of urgency.

Let me explain so a woman is about to get executed and you and a bunch of cops have to go save her.  They're trotting there horses while this beautiful woman is about to be killed.  So while you're forced to screw around or fail the mission someone who you're responsible for is going to die.

Singleplayer is not why you play a rockstar game, you play it to run around destroying stuff and causing havoc.  Rockstar seems to think people play games like GTA for their story.  The story of every GTA I ever played has been bland and boring.

Go help this guy shoot some people, go steal this, rape these women etc cookie cutter

The multiplayer is a joke too.

If you seriously think you'll like this game buy it.  I played it till the end and can't stand this game.  It is an insult to good gaming, it's boring, lacks an escape from reality and has no replay value.  Sorry I don't want to play poker for replay value.

1.0,False,"02 28, 2012",A3URVWPFJOHT72,B004PAGJOC,zlionsfan,"When you hear ""multiplayer RPG with zombies"", if you have any interest in either RPGs or zombie games, your first reaction would be ""sign me up!"" It's what I thought when I got Dead Island for Christmas. Zombies, modded weapons, sandbox-style play, a Diablo-like skill tree ... even for someone who doesn't do a lot of online gaming, it seemed like a great idea. What could possibly go wrong with it?

To put it bluntly, everything. The map is nearly useless: neither areas nor buildings are marked, detail is poor, quest locations are usually but not always highlighted, and worst of all, parts of the map are randomly inaccessible for no reason at all, which renders most of the features useless. Sure, you can mark a single location as your target (and you'll need to, often), but if you can't move the cursor onto your target, you have to settle for marking some random spot along your path, moving some ways past your mark, opening the map again, and seeing if you can now access the area of the map you wanted in the first place. (I'm not talking about grayed-out areas, the places you haven't visited. I mean places you've visited already. The cursor simply stops at a certain point and won't move any further.)

You'll have to mark places often because the pathing algorithm is terrible. Sometimes it'll lead you to where you want to go, but frequently it won't show up at all - which makes no sense, because you can mark your destination (if the map lets you) and get the exact path you should have got from the quest itself. Other times, the path will lead you straight up a mountain or through a locked gate or an unscalable wall ... at times, it'll even take you in the exact opposite of the direction you really need to go.

There's no way to save your game: a relic of 1990s gaming. Instead, the game autosaves at certain changes in location and after completing parts of each main quest or side quest. You won't lose a lot of progress if you die or quit, but you'll be restarted at some semi-random point if you die - sometimes closer than you were to your goal, sometimes farther away - and occasionally in the middle of whatever just killed you. If it's a difficult section to escape, too bad: you can't back up and try a different approach because you have one save per game. Because of that, if something happens to your saved game, all your progress is lost. (Or maybe it isn't. At one point, my level-43 Xian just disappeared, with no explanation. I put about 5 hours into a new one, and then a few days later, the old one was back.)

There are limited slots in your inventory; that coupled with item wear is a good way to make you think about what items to carry. At one point in the story, you have a companion who'll carry items for you. She'll wait at a safe place, and you can meet up with her and give her items to store or take back ones you already gave her ... unless, that is, your inventory is already full. In that case, the item she gives you might simply disappear with no way to recover it. Was it a unique item? Too bad! It's gone. (What makes this worse is that the bug was fixed in a patch for the PC; the 360 version was patched as well, but this bug wasn't fixed.)

Even little things are off. In addition to standard achievements, there are challenges, some of which are the same as achievements. You can track your progress on both from the pause menu ... except that when you pause the game, the background doesn't change, so if you pause the game with a lot of white sand in view, you won't be able to read the white text for the challenges or achievements.

One of the challenges involves ""analog"" attacks: instead of pressing buttons, you use the analog stick to swing your weapon. (Also a relic of games past: EA can tell you all about this fad.) It seems like a nice way to do things, but it's horribly clumsy. You can only swing your weapon to match compass points - in this case, straight up or down and straight left or right - but the effort involved will make it much harder to target enemies and complete combos. In addition, the same stick is also used for aiming, so to target a body part, you have to move the stick to aim, squeeze the right trigger, move the stick again to swing, and hope that the zombie in your sights didn't move during all that.

There are a lot of things about this game that are done well - the story is actually kind of interesting, the challenge system scales pretty well and has nice bonuses with it, death is never really final, and the game-plus mode makes it much easier to go back and complete collections - but it's hard to recommend this as anything more than a dollar-store purchase. Rewarding a company for publishing such a slipshod product, patching it poorly, and releasing DLC for it rather than fixing the other giant bugs just sends the wrong message.

- The game will be locked to the initial Steam account. If you friend or family member wants to borrow the game, they will need your login credentials.

- Lack of standalone patches. This is a major incovenience as Steam will try to install the latest patch version even if it's problematic or broken. It is also impossible to backup these patches, requiring you to download them each time.

I'm not saying this to say we're Game Gods. I'm saying this because we were in utter shock that the game is so short, so boring, and so completely unlike the previous games that we loved. I can't even imagine how the company that created the previous, fantastic Gauntlet games could be responsible for this release. Maybe they lost their good programmers and were under contract to release a new Gauntlet by X date, so they had their newbie coders kick this out? I am just horrified at how poor this game was.

First, you get a choice of four charaters, of course - the elf, warrior, mage or valkyrie. However, you don't get to choose their color! I know it's a small thing, but I was ticked at that to start.

Your character has 3 main attacks plus 1 long-range attack - so the elf gets 3 sword swings plus his bow attack. In addition, there are combo attacks and d-button super attacks that you can pay to unlock over time. You then move from map to map, bashing away at enemies, killing the enemy generators and finding keys for doors. That part of the gameplay is similar to previous games. You can't shoot your friends in the back of the head, which my fellow gamers appreciated greatly. I was notorious for standing in the back area as the elf and just letting the arrows fly.

Really, the huge issue is the game's shortness. If it was 3-4 times longer, at least, it would seem perhaps worth playing. But I really found its entire layout much less interesting than the previous Gauntlet. In the previous one, you had a central area from where you could go out to various worlds, each with its own theme, going back and forth as you wished. In this one it's just a straight line, and while there are some thematic elements, it came across as a dungeon crawl that just plodding on for a few hours, then stopped.

Also, in the previous games, when you got character upgrades it was really exciting. You clearly saw the change and it was something fun to pay attention to. In this one when you get weapon and armor upgrades, you can barely tell. We would even stare at our characters before doing an upgrade, and it was hard to see anything had even changed.

The vocals really didn't impress me much. Part of the problem is that they would tell you ""elf needs food"" when the elf still had a ways to go - but then they would tell you ""starving"" and ""has died"" right on top of each other. So you were always being harassed about needing food, but never when you really needed to know. Also, with death being able to be slain with a mana blast, you pretty much were able to kill off death in .2 seconds any time you opened a chest. So Death was barely announcing his presence before he vanished again.

The graphics were good. There were many spots that looked walkable that you were magically blocked from going into, which was a bit annoying. If an area isn't open, don't put a wide open door pointing to it :)

I just don't know what went wrong here. I am extremely disappointed. Be sure to rent this game first, to see if it's something you would enjoy more than a day or two.",A big letdown for a huge Gauntlet fan,1135209600,27,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

Not only is this game completely unplayable, it looks horrible and it FEELS unfinished (and that's got to say something for such an old game!).

The info on the eShop mentions this is a 3D remastered version of the all time classic... Well, NO! It's completely 2D, nothing in the game uses 3D not even the intro movie. It wouln't be a problem, IF the graphics where of an acceptable quality: the images are completely blurry and impossible to look at sometimes. There are also some video sequences and effects that don't happen at all, leaving you wondering what just happened.

It would be passable... IF the game could be played at all! The ""action"" happens on the top screen (WHY!? It doesn't even use 3D!) and to advance you must move a cursor around with the circle pad, that would be fine, IF it worked correctly: the cursor is crazy fast and it goes back to the center of the screen when you let go of the circle pad, that means you must be incredibly precise to select stuff, and sometimes the things you must use are either very small or very hard to identify.
The touch screen has what I would consider the worst touch menu ever, it's imprecise and completely useless. It's also horrible to look at, there's not even a background!

Then again, I had paid for it. I thought I could use a walktrhough online to get through the game just to ""beat"" it. No no no no no, right after I advanced through the main world and reached the first level of the game (a ship) and looked around... The game crashed. CRASHED. That was enough, I gave up.

Second of all, they took away everything with the game play that made it so engrossing for people like me.  Storytelling.

Within 10 minutes I'm in love with this thing lol. The Vita feels SO much better holding it while in this. It's not hard plastic but more of a suede/ rubbery feel.. It doesnt' feel cheap at all, it's very solid. And very comfortable.  This is THE grip/external battery to get. The sony battery may be able to charge other things, but I didn't like the idea of something hanging off the vita while playing (then again the official cord is long enough that it probably wouldn't). However I also didn't like the fact that when playing BEFORE I got this, with the vita plugged in, while sitting in my recliner.... the usb cord plugged into the bottom was poking my groin (if you hold it in your lap instead of up in your face, which would happen with sony's charger plugged in as well). Plus this was half the price of the sony charger.

If you have no problems like I said above... you might want to also look into the PDP Trigger Grip. It's very well reviewed in all the youtube vids i watched, and the vita does NOT fall out of it unless you twist the grip while the vita's IN IT (like it's instructions tell you NOT to do). But there's no twisting with this Nyko grip, it's very solid, And it solves the problem of a grip AND the battery life at the same time. I highly recommend this.

You might want to get a extra USB cord, and a USB wall outlet adapter to keep this charged somewhere if you use the vita w/o it sometimes. The Vita itself won't charge out of a wall adapter (at least the two I have, and yes I know the vita won't charge on just USB unless it's off, although I think the vita was charging off it THROUGH this grip wile it was on.....). I'm also getting sony's stand (along with another set of cords for THAT) for just using it as a mp3 player or w/e on my desk.

I'll update this if the Grip's battery life doesn't hold up to what everyone else has said.

Edit: Been using this thing all night not plugged in (to the wall), this grip definitely lives up to expectations.

1.0,False,"10 5, 2009",A3EW2L59UBHQSG,B002BSC55M,Bruce Aguilar,"Sony's new PSP Go is an update to the venerable PSP handheld gaming device. No doubt that it's a small sexy looking device but after giving it some thought I can't think of a single reason someone should get it.

Aside from super sexy aesthetics what really differentiates the PSP Go from it's main competition (the Nintendo DS) is that it's an all digital device.  What does that mean?  Well, you no longer go to a physical store to buy games for the PSP Go because it doesn't have a slot for UMD games.  Like the iPhone it has an online store where you purchase and download all your games.  You'll be able to find PSP Mini games (smaller games that you'd find on the iPhone) as well as regular PSP games such as Gran Turismo.  Pretty cool huh?

But think about this.  With a downloaded game, you can't share it with a friend without giving them your system.  Also you loose the ability to sell the game after you've finished it or realized that you actually hate the game and want to get back some of the cash you just wasted on it. So the only real benefit of an all digital system is that you get instant gratification.  See a game on the store you just have to play, pay, download and play.  That would be pretty cool except Sony botched up wireless service for the PSP Go.

First off the PSP Go uses an old standard for wireless connectivity, 802.11b instead of the more recent and much faster g and n.  Why create a device that can only function wirelessly then use an outdated, slow standard?  But it doesn't end there.  Sony also designed the PSP Go so that if you are downloading a game and you loose the network connection for some reason (which tends to happen a lot more on the outdated b standard), the next time you connect the system doesn't pick up form where it left off but instead starts downloading all over again.  Insane!  It's not uncommon to hear reports of three hours download times for a single game.  Ouch!  And it's all because of the Sony is using older wi-fi technology.

Why did Sony choose to make getting games such a pain in the neck?  Shouldn't this, the big selling point of the device, be quick, simple and painless?  I'd rather spend the three hours driving to a store, buying a game, getting home and playing it than just sitting around waiting for a download.  Oh did, I forget to mention that when the PSP Go is downloading you can't do anything else with the device?

Aside from core functionality problems, there are other concerns.  Sony created a new proprietary connection cable for the PSP Go so all you previous PSP owners can't use any of the cables, or devices you have for the original system.  Controls are cramped and the system in uncomfortable to hold.  And of course to enjoy all the agony that the PSP Go offers you have to pay $250.  That's just $50 less than a PS3!  A Nintendo DSi is $170.  An iPod Touch is $199.  Why pay $250 when you can buy a PSP 3000 for $170 and it will do all the PSP Go does and more (like play UMD games and movies).

I've checked back every day.  But despite hundreds of reviews read and dozens of videos watched:  I have not played the game.

So WHY do I feel I can review this?  ANSWER:  The server issues alone are enough to give the game a 1 star at current time.  Some of those issue will improve, some will remain.  The game also happens to have issues outside this.  Issues agreed on by both sides.  I'll tackle those too.

Server issues:
1.  Servers being crap on launch week = Horrible, but forgivable.  Code limitations should have been ironed out in beta, and plenty of hardware should have been provided for launch.  Blizzard is NOT a poor indie company that randomly got massive unforseen demand.  Still, things happen.

2.  Servers being crap on the following week = WTF.  Again Code should have been stress tested and broken during beta.  If they didn't have enough servers a week gave them plenty of time to set up more.  Blizzard has the money, it just didn't want to spend it.

3.  Servers still having regular issues over 2 weeks following launch = No words for this.  Simply unacceptable for a company of its resources and the amount of development time/metrics they had for this.

4.  Cannot play single player offline.

5.  Server problems further destroy the single player experience.

6.  Great, now people are regularly getting hacked playing single player.  Bravo Blizzard.

Non-Server Issues:

7.  Character customization has been disintegrated.  While this offers a more flexible approach that streamlines and yes simplifies, it nonetheless robs a very important part of the game away from many people.  Also, that streamlining and the old issues could have been fixed within the old system easily.  This lowers replay.  Yes maybe YOU don't have an issue with this but people have spoken.  An overwhelming amount of people DO have an issue with this, minor or major.

8.  Items.  Diablo has always had a strong loot basing as well as being fun to play.  Unfortunately the loot distribution and balancing in Diablo 3 is broken atm.  Magic items are better than items of higher rarity because they have an inherently much higher dps.  Items also appear to be more rare in general by far.  This lower also replay.

9.  Auction House, for money.  That's ok, that's what the auction house is for right?  Oh, but ya, you're decent items will likely be selling for real world cash now.  At least, once it actually works reliably and they add real money.  So enjoy your poor itemization unless you want to pay.  Because even if you trade 1:1 value on the AH you'll lose 15%+ listing fee to blizzard.  Both sides will :).  Yay?

10.  Randomization is very limited:  While mobs randomize fairly well maps themselves randomize only minimally.  This leads to the same layout and very similar experience on additional runs through an area.  This is the 3rd thing that lowers replay.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

11.  Linear.  With the game being linear your forced down a cattle chute constantly being hemmed in and guided in only X direction.  This inability to freely roam even further limits replay.  Combined with the simplified character customization, itemization, and randomization this is a killer that has many people already burning out.  People that would not burn out near as easily on this exact same game otherwise.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

12. Graphics:  When most people including most 5 star reviews note that the graphics are last gen, I believe them.  This isn't as important to me but if graphics being lower than they should be for a game of this calibur bothers you than it's a big strike.

13.  Story:  I'm sorry again, most people even 5 star reviews saying the story is forgettable (if they are kind) and horrible (if they are mean) tells me that the story is simply lack luster.  I don't expect epicness in this day and age, but cheese factor and mismanagement of prominent characters is a no no.  Only certain genres like comic books and comedies can pull that off IF DONE RIGHT.

Overview:

Lets disregard the server issues as that would automatically fail this game as a consideration for purchase.  It's assumed these will, eventually (and apparently with the minimum money investment possible) be fixed.  Regardless it's UNFORGIVABLE for a company with the resources of Blizzard and with the testing time/metrics/sales predicitions they had at their disposal.

Is this a fun game from everything I know?  Yes.  Will it be worth playing after they get server issues lined out?  Yes.  Is it a AAA title or worth $60?  HECK NO!!  This is the level of polish, length, and quality that you should expect from an Indie developer just putting itself on the map and selling the game at $15-$20.  This is not the level of game expected of a company the size and notoriety of Blizzard.

You'd be way way better off spending your $60 on say, Fallout 1, 2, 3 and New Vegas.  Torchlight + Titan's Quest, and $20 left over for whatever you wish.  ETC.  There are way too many options to justify $60 on this game when you can make far far better use of your money elsewhere with far less frustration and likely more and longer fun.",Unforgivable.,1338508800,13,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

For me, the worst part of the game is the menu system. It's by far the most unintuitive interface I have ever seen. Nothing is where it should be, making any change to anything takes for-friggin-ever, and it's all buried under a completely asinine right stick menu (I use an xbox controller) with all kinds of ""hidden"" tricks and things most people don't want to have to play a guessing game to get to.

And since most of the people who know Tom Clancy titles mainly play on the consoles, the square peg of the RTS would have to be cut down to fit in the round hole of the consoles.

In doing so, they lost the ability to click and drag a lasso around units to order groups around, the ability to command more than a dozen units, and worst of all, the ability to move the camera around at will. In its place is a voice command system that WOULD be innovative and useful if A) it wasn't a laddered command system nightmare and B) it was trainable, so it could be taught to recognize my voice instead of confusing ""Unit 1 capture A"" for ""Unit 1 Retreat."" There is training, but it's there to teach the player to say the commands the same way every time, not to train the computer to understand us. Again, this was put in to compensate for the console's lack of mouse capability.

Aside from what I've listed so far, the game's biggest fault is the lack of strategy. The gameplay is always the same - either capturing nodes in a territory control game, or holding out against an attacking force for a certain amount of time. But between the unit's absolutely glacial movement speed, the cripplingly small amount of units and types of units you can command, their fragility, and how obvious it was that the developers really didn't care about this game, and things degenerate into a boring game of rock-paper-scissors that you always lose, because the enemy always has more units. Tank beats APC beats Gunship beats Tank. However the enemy units are always tougher, so you'd better have 2-1 odds if you want to win without heavily damaged units, and you won't have those odds. There's a system where a heavily damaged unit won't be able to move, and they have to be evacuated by helicopter or they'll die for real. It's supposed to encourage you to not throw your units away, because units that survive battles become more experienced, but it makes little difference.

The story plays out like some deranged fantasy told by someone recovering from general anesthesia and the removal of their wisdom teeth.

The game can perhaps best be summed up by a quote from the creative director, one Mr. De Plater: ""every time they cut features out, it just made the game better.""

Perhaps he's forgotten that a game needs features. Especially an RTS game.

I didn't have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity. And then I saw the second game in the series on the shelves. I said, ""I'd heard the questions aren't repeated as much"", and I decided to buy it just to see if it was true.
It's true, the questions aren't repeated as much as before. The problem is, now they're MUCH harder! It's impossible to get anything higher than $16,000 now! And since the questions don't repeat, you'll never get to the top!
But what's the worst part? That's the ONLY CHANGE that was made to this game. NOTHING ELSE!!!!! It's as if the first game had no problems whatsoever! Regis is STILL appallingly rude and impatient, the ""Fastest Finger"" mode STILL doesn't let you put the four answers in order, the game STILL quits if you take too long to do things, you STILL can't skip the introduction sequence, the Phone-a-friend lifeline is STILL worthless, there's STILL no option to make the games easier or harder, you STILL only get instructions once, and there's STILL no option to use the mouse! Regis even says EXACTLY the same stuff as before!
I bought the game out of total curiosity, just to see if this game was really any better than the first. As it turns out, it is virtually the EXACT SAME GAME. It has all the problems of the first, except for one which was replaced by another one!

That was when THQ was still in business, but alas, they are gone now and Activision has stepped in to completely smash the franchise into the undersea floor. Spongebob Squarepants: Plankton's Millionth Attempt was the first game in the brand that Activision crapped out in as late as 2013 for pretty much every console under the sun except Playstation 4 and Xbox One (BOY they dodged a bullet here), and it shows. A LOT.

If there's anything I could give Plankton's Mindnumbing Disservice credit for, it's that the opening and ending cutscenes are pleasantly animated, and the music is fine enough on its own. Everything else about the game makes me wish Activision never grabbed a hold of the license to begin with.

The gameplay consists of some of the dullest platforming ever; all the platforming elements you ever do are running, jumping, pressing floor buttons, and repeat. However, because this is Activision, that isn't the main focus; that honor goes to SHOOTING instead. Yes, that's right; even Spongebob and friends can't escape the horrors of being published by the people that market Call of Duty. The weapons themselves are fictional blasters, mind you, but they are only present for you to shoot the same two or three types of robots over and over and over and over again. And the same ""mid-boss"" music jingle plays EVERY SINGLE TIME a gate blocks your path and you must kill robots to unlock it.

Nothing ever changes other than whether or not there'll be moving platforms, floor buttons that follow a super-easy pattern, or if the scenery decides to be different. The very repetitive and minimal level design is here and accounted for throughout the entire game without evolving a bit. Sure, you can provide slight upgrades to your weapon, but is that REALLY necessary in the grand scheme of things? Of course not. The best it ever does is waste a few LESS seconds of time per moment a group of enemies stop you from progressing.

Plankton's Shameless Cashgrab also has four boss battles, but they are all simply slight variations of each other; they all do the usual boss strategies that are as weak and dull as the levels you go through to get to them. Not only does nothing interesting ever happen, but the cutscenes that occur before and after beating the boss are as lazy as they can be; let's just have Spongebob and friends standing around a giant robot and cracking up bad jokes before declaring they'll go beat him!

Overall, this game is pretty much at the quality I've expected Activision to give it when I first heard they would be the new holders of the Spongebob license for video games. Seeing how the more recent game, Spongebob HeroPants, is just this made even worse, I think it's safe to say we won't ever be able to see a new Spongebob game that's any good, let alone as good as Battle for Bikini Bottom, ever again.",Plankton's Repetitive Wreck,1444867200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I should mention that I don't own this game, I played it at a friends house. I will not buy a copy because: 1. The game play is pretty boring, 2. the concept has been dumbed-down to the level where this is a game for 12 year olds, and 3. the draconian DRM.

Now, on to the review. I'm always loved Maxis games, and own all of the sim city games, going back to the original for Nintendo. I also own the Sims, the Sims II, and enjoyed them quite a bit. So I was really looking forward to this game, and have tracked its progress for nearly two years.
I was excited about the concept, and watching as my genetic children grew to take over the universe...

Sadly, most of what was most exciting about that original concept has been stripped from the game. Now, as other have mentioned, adding more legs doesn't increase speed more than a better +5 foot. Many of the genetic options are self-excluding, because why would you pick an inferior body part even if it looked cool, knowing it would make your creatures ultimately inferior?

The game play is tiresome and monotonous. I got bored at the begining, and then the space stage is nearly unplayable. It is so boring, I find myself wishing it were more like Stelcon3D, a game that is almost 20 years old! Seriously, if they wanted to add RTS elements to the game, they should have made it more challenging and less user intensive to manage every little thing...

The previous Diablo games had offline + LAN play to complement Battlenet play. Blizzard, in their infinite wisdom, decided to remove both LAN as well as offline play. So instead of a majority of customers who bought the game getting to play it after installing/unlocking, and waiting patiently to play on Battlenet with friends later when login issues are resolved, no one gets to play.

I get it that the auction house will revolve around real-world money, and Blizzard wants to have complete control over that, which means forcing everyone to be constantly connected. But in previous Diablo games, our LAN and single-player offline characters were stored locally (on the computer you played the game from), while our Battlenet characters were stored server-side. This allowed LAN/offline players to use mods as well as character editors, but protected the 'official' Battlenet multiplayer community by keeping them separate.

I can only give this game 1 star because you have to give it at least one.

NOPE!

The way this way this controller is designed requires the base station contacts to line up with a cutout in the back of the controller in order to charge the battery.  It never lines up right.  I have tried many things, but the best thing seems to be to remove the back cover on the controller and wiggle the controller until the station lights up. Then don't move, don't even think about moving the slightest movement might set off the perfect balance you have achieved.
Got 2 controllers?  Oh boy, now you need to find two perfect balances and this time in addition to not moving, think about not breathing.

I joke, but it feels like that.

The best thing about this systems are the batteries themselves.  The controller with randomly power off, which is awesome when you are in the middle of an epic Titanfall battle and get to watch your titan get helplessly pummeled why you struggle to get your controller back on.  So much fun.

1.0,True,"01 4, 2009",A39UWRB7ZFUPJ6,B001F0L81O,Incitatus,"Impressions for the first 5 hours of play: We just finished Gothic 1 for the third or forth time right before starting this one. Interesting comparison between a decade old (almost) game and current stuff.

First, the fact that we could get thru Gothic at all without getting bored is a testament to how terrific that game was (and is).

FG loaded on my system without a hitch. I loaded both patches too. No problems running it though it does seem to stutter a bit which surprises me. Sort of a surprise given I have dual nvidea 8800's and 4 g of ram. Other techie oddity is how long it takes to load a game.

I appreciate the fact that the text is actually readable for me. We play on a 65"" home theater screen and tiny fonts are a problem. In fact, everything is clear as a bell.

At the outset the quests have been cute/interesting. It seems that the writing is a bit more tongue in cheek in this outing than in the earlier ones. I am impressed with the renderings of landscape and buildings, clearer somehow than G3.

No bugs yet and no crashes.

Seems pretty enjoyable, particularly as a filler till G4 comes along.

Impressions for the middle 1/3 of the game:

Very odd. Odd that you could be directed to kill Anton when he is still part of a quest. Or that you could be directed to take his widow ""back to Anton""

I am finding an amazing level of sloppiness in this game, that and a linearity that was not present in any of the other Gothics.

The thing that may be a killer though, is the way that the Hero has been made into a self-righteous prick.

That is absolutely a non-starter in the world a RPG. A Hero that you can't root for.

Anybody else feel the same?

Impressions at the end of the game:  The latest bug is that saves seem to be corrupted after I fight in the cave against the Summoner and his henchmen.  Quicksaves and regular saves, in the cave or outside, result in a crash to the desktop when I try to lead them.  Effectively, it seems, one must do the entire endgame in one pass.

""That isn't a bug, it's a feature!!"":D

It does not really matter, which is really a sad statement.  I noticed, as I spoke with Immanuel and Gorn that the developers didn't even bother to make sure that the person being talked to was synced with the action.  As Immanuel ""talked"" his image was active engaged in conversation with an NPC.  At this stage it seemed to me that 50% or more of the dialog was not voiced.  Also, the correspondence between the spoken words and the written finally broke down almost completely.

I am not sure what to make of this.  I sort of got over the bugs in the earlier part of the game and tried to enjoy it.  I used the console to raise my stamina to 500 so that I could actually engage in combat (I suggest that everyone do that, BTW).  I got over the ludicrous, stilted, third world sounding interchanges as well as the general prickiness of the Hero.  The game moved along and, with the console, I could ""fix"" the occasional problem.  Was not bad (not great, I hasten to add) for a while.  Now this.

Just because you call it a game does not make it one.

This was a real disappointment to me.

All I can say is shame on everyone who had anything to do with this. Particularly shame on Dreamcatcher (the US distributor). I would be VERY careful about further entries in this franchise, I fear that they might be little more than money grubbing pieces of unfinished software.",Journal made during gameplay.

Bakehorn,"Launch titles are generally hit or miss, and gamers have seen the praise corralled by Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Rayman Raving Rabbids, and a few of the Wii's other titles. One might start to wonder if there are any misses, but surely enough something comes along and proves that nothing in gaming is perfect. That something is Ubisoft's GT Pro Series, and it's a crash, a burn, and all of the excruciating pain during and after. Gamers, allow me to introduce the biggest loser of the launch, and possibly the worst launch title in ages.

Before explaining the slew of what went wrong, I'll explain the one-ONE-thing that went right. Ubisoft packaged a plastic steering wheel accessory with GT Pro Series; an accessory that could prove useful in future racing games. Well, that about sums it up.

Moving on, GT Pro Series is an arcade racer in a sim's skin. The ridiculously dry and uninspired courses seem to place emphasis on quick turns and drifts rather than careful, calculated entry and exit maneuvers. After forgetting about the plastic wheel accessory and taking note of the core mechanics, it is realized that absolutely nothing is new here-in fact, some classic games like F-Zero have more unique and interesting racing perks. You accelerate, brake, and turn. Sometimes you drift. That's it. I'd insert a Wii pun by saying ""Wii!"" with the implied sarcasm that would come from saying ""whee,"" but the Wii doesn't deserve to be discredited in such a way.

The game treats you to a few equally boring gameplay modes. First, you have the awfully dull Championship Mode that takes you through different tournaments and events. Winning these events yields new cars, parts, and events. You don't purchase anything. You simply win stuff to unlock more stuff. Outside of that, there's a Quick Race that will likely go untouched and a Versus Mode for anyone with friends willing to play a racing game as terrible as GT Pro Series. Then there's the Drift Combo Mode, which is the biggest load of gameplay slop I've seen in a racing game. Drifting controls are, for the lack of a better term, uncontrollable. Going into turns at high speeds and driving sideways should be fun, not the mess that GT makes it out to be.

There are 80 licensed cars and 10 tracks (20 if you include their mirrored versions) to race them in. Unfortunately, none of the 80 cars control uniquely. In fact, most of them, when put through the tracks and their ridiculously placed turns, will have you wildly spinning your Wii remote around trying to stay on course. Who cares if you're driving a Mitsubishi Lancer if it steers like a minivan? Speaking of steers, an enraged bull would be as controllable as GT Pro Series often is-I've actually turned the opposite direction that I was motioning in my hands. I've even driven through corners and stuck to walls. What's with the physics? Oftentimes there is no repercussion whatsoever for banging into the CPU racers that otherwise drive in a set, unchanging line. Tuning your cars fails to do anything interesting or unique, though I was curious as to why GT Pro Series lets you change the type of seats in your car when you can't ever see them through the car windows, which are tinted by default. The point is, I don't care how many cars are in your video game if the game itself is a boring one that is unimpressive in every other possible way. I'd rather look at a harmless picture of a Toyota Celica than virtually steer one into walls and get stuck on them.

Unbeknownst to me until doing some research, GT Pro Series was actually a racing game that came out in the middle of the Gamecube's life on Nintendo's last-generation console. It shows through its technical factors, especially when you take a look at the visuals. Cel shading is great and all, but GT Pro Series does it so effortlessly that it seems to be a cheap, easy exit out of making detailed physics and to-the-last-detail car models. There are virtually no special effects to be found, spare the SNES-quality dust and particles that come up when you drive through grass (it'll happen a lot) or drift through a turn. The track designs are as unique, original, and interesting as a bleach-blonde sorority girl wearing tan Ugg boots and thin, black sweat pants listening to ""Fergalicious"" on a pink iPod. At least the names aren't deceptive-""Downtown Street"" takes you through a blocky, grey urban area. Imagine that. Don't even get me started on the music that could have been created by turkeys (mm, Thanksgiving) pecking furiously on an electronic keyboard. Still, the worst of all production values are the sound effects. Probably the only thing that doesn't make one's ears bleed is the sound of the Wii's Home Button being pressed to remove this game from your television screen. Really, if under some catastrophic circumstance you absolutely have to play this video game, do it on mute.

No quality keeps GT Pro Series from the lowest dismal status I've seen in a long, long time. The plastic wheel is a nice peripheral but the circular plastic apparatus that comes with it is as worthless as the thin plastic that you remove to open the plastic game case. If you've got money laying around and contemplated picking up this smoking pile of rubble, I'd more than urge you to look at something else; for example, I mentioned F-Zero earlier. Download it for a tenth the price of GT Pro Series on the Virtual Console. To end this tea-bagging of Ubisoft's awful racing game, if this is the way that Wii racers will fare in the future, I hope that developers abandon the racing genre and Nintendo keeps their Mario Kart franchise on the DS.",Crash and burn.,1164758400,20,,

All the new features are ok in theory, but of course very few of them actually work the way they're supposed to.  Even after patching to 1.2, sometimes i'll get piles of ""gong"" all over the castle, while my gong farmers just stand around doing nothing.  The only fix for this seems to be deleting all my structures, and then starting over.

The first Stronghold focused mainly on defense, with only a few attack missions.  I found that to be a very nice change of pace, i don't recall ANY game that ever focused purely on defense before.  Of course, the second one seems to mainly be an attack based game.  The castles aren't nearly as strong as they were in the first one.  Most siege weapons can destroy even the strongest castle in a matter of seconds (as well as your brave defenders now).

========================================
Update April 2014
========================================

To those who argue the graphics are great and that negative reviewers have never played the game...

First off the graphics aren't first rate. They were back in 2008 with GTA4 maybe, but not now! At best GTA5's graphics are an incremental improvement over GTA4, but not enough considering the long development time. There are now vastly superior open-world driving titles with better graphics such as Driver-San Francisco, and even that isn't anything new. (And no, I'm no fan of Ubisoft and their DRM from hell before you ask).

The graphics are poor in GTA5 and its because they've failed to develop their Rage engine. You can see it in the frame Rate and Rendering. During a chase scene especially, the graphics of GTA lack clarity and are more blurry than Driver-SF, and this is primarily because the frame rate is much lower in GTA, and because the rendering system lacks clarity!

Its possible there are more meshes and varying terrains and landscapes with more animations in GTA. But Driver-SF is just more clever in how it renders the scene, and ultimately this is a high-paced driving game and so clarity really matters. The game could have been improved upon before release. But I think the development team have become decadent and lazy because of past success. Also, a lot of their better developers have left, especially in Rockstar North!

I played the game for 60+ hours, so I think that counts as having played it. Yes, there's a lot to do as there was in the GTA3 series and which GTA4 lacked. But its all very repetitive and not well thought out. In short there's nothing new here, and it lacks the charm of earlier titles. For example aircraft in the game still handle poorly. And while you can steal a jet from the military base and take it for a ride, you only get seconds of fuel to go joyriding! The tanks are too slow and boring too and there's only incremental improvement in the bikes and cars. I prefer driving real cars in open-world driving games, and there's too few exotic and interesting cars in this franchise to keep my attention. Who wants to drive a Truck? This is a video game, so I want to drive a Ferrari!

Don't get me started about the AI either. Rockstar just haven't done anything new in this area. Player actions on the city are non-existent also, and this is a wasted opportunity if ever there was one.

There's a lot of swearing because the game is shallow with its never ending 2-bit gangster portrayals. The earlier series had lots of swearing too but they had more charm. When swearing exists just to hide a dearth of new ideas, that's when the series becomes stale and should be dropped.",Italy?... China?... Underwater?.... Space? ...

What is truly sad though, is to think of how good this game COULD have been.  The visuals are outstanding, the speed is amazing, and all the while the frame-rate is as smooth as butter.  Paradise also boasts smooth controls and a pretty good soundtrack.  But if you loved the previous Burnout titles be prepared for a major shock... or several, as a matter of fact.  Here are my biggest complaints:

1) No Crash Mode.  Here's an idea: Lets take one of the series' most memorable and beloved features and give it the axe.  Yes its totally nixed.  Why?  Who knows.

2) No ""Retry"" option. Yes you heard me correctly.  If you screw up you CAN'T RESTART THE RACE!  Which leads me to my next complaint...

3) Backtracking.  Just lose a race?  Oh well, you'll just have to drive the five miles back to the starting point. What? You can't find the starting point again?

4) Awful navigation.  It is way too easy to get lost, and there is no way to instantly ""Jump To"" an event or location.  Furthermore, the mini map is fixed.  Anyone who plays open-world racers knows it is much easier to have the map orient itself to the direction of the car.

5) No ""Quit Race"" option. Oops, I didn't want to play THIS race.  I guess I'll just have to meander about until the timer runs down.

NOTE TO THE DEVELOPER: Thanks for taking a perfectly good series and screwing it up.  You were so busy trying to jump on the ""open-world"" BANDWAGON that you forgot why fans really loved the Burnout franchise to begin with.  If gamers want to play ""open-world"" racing, they play Midnight Club, Need For Speed: Most Wanted, Test Drive Unlimited, or one of the many others out there.

1.0,False,"12 20, 2007",AHCVWPLA1O4X8,B000R0SRY4,bixodoido,"I don't expect much when it comes to video games based on movies.  Quite often they feature mediocre gameplay, a boring storyline that sort of, but doesn't really follow the plot of the film, and pointless objectives that make you feel the developers were banking on the franchise itself to sell copies of the game and didn't care about making it something actually worth playing.  But The Golden Compass is bad, really bad, even for a movie based game.

I gave the game a chance--I played through the whole thing--but I just couldn't get over how poorly made it was.  For starters, the gameplay is dull and the difficulty varies far too much for a game intended for younger children.  At times you're pushing the button flashing up on the screen (which is fine), and at other times you're trying to keep Iorik alive while he's fighting the witch queen or a guy with a flamethrower.  This game is rated for kids 10+, but I imagine a child that age would be bored stiff with the button matching mini-games and frustrated beyond belief with the more difficult parts of the game.

The controls are fairly straightforward but the camera angle is absolutely awful.  In fact I spent as much time trying to overcome the terrible angle, when I couldn't see what I was fighting or the ledge to which I was supposed to be jumping, as I did trying doing anything else.  If the camera worked right the game would still be dull and rather pointless, but the camera angle makes this game nearly unplayable.

Part of the potential appeal for this game comes from the prospect of playing as Iorik, the polar bear who accompanies the girl Lyra on her adventures.  Playing Iorik is the best part of the game, but unfortunately the majority of the game is spent playing as Lyra, thus stifling what could, possibly, have been the game's only redeeming quality.

There are many, many better games available for the price.  Don't be fooled into buying it just because it accompanies the movie--this title is bound to bring frustration and annoyance to anyone who plays it.  And even if, somehow, someone were to enjoy the game, the entire storyline is good for about 5 hours of play--definitely not worth it.","horrendous gameplay makes this one to avoid, regardless of what you think about the movie",1198108800,14,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Update: The Sega forums suggest some solutions to the glitchy scenarios which you might want to try. The following is a list of keyboard controls which is different from (and more complete) than the game manual. HTH:

Iron Man Keyboard controls

W Move Forward
A Move Backward
S Move Left
D Move Right
Mouse Move Camera / Target Enemy
Left Mouse Button Fire Weapon
Middle Mouse Wheel Next Weapon
Right Mouse Button Afterburner
Space Bar Hover Up
X Freefall (when hovering)
F Punch / Contextual Action
Shift Dash
1 Propulsion Energy
2 Armor Energy
3 Weapon Energy
4 Even Energy
Escape Pause Menu

Left Alt: Afterburner flight

The game starts off nicely enough with a ""bash through the tunnels and kill the bad guys"" scenario. Simplistic controls, dated graphics but not bad either. Second scenario is flight and weapons testing, an overly long tutorial as you learn the basics of flight and weapons with the suit. Not bad either but then the scenario doesn't end, you can't get out of the warehouse/target range to move on to the next scenario. The walkthrough that's posted online is for the console version, NOT the PC version (appears to be major differences) and there are no patches posted, I'm writing this on May 24, 2008 and hoping that they'll fix the problem and post a patch for it. So far I'm very disappointed, I have to agree with the poster who said this looks like a ""rush job"" rather than a finished product.

What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation. You get 5 of these, then the game ceases to function and you'll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy (not call them for more activations as it should say).

SecuROM has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to CD/DVD drive incompatibility problems (usually older drives). You will typically get CRC or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive. SecuROM also maintain a ""black list"" of processes where it won't allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or running.

SecuROM is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasn't had much impact on piracy at all. In fact, the pirates enjoy greater freedom and far less headaches than the honest customer. Spore is a great example of why SecuROM is bad all the way around.

The only good things about this game is the art direction and the story.  The graphics and story are basically ""anime/manga-ish"", both of which, while not awesome, give this game alot of character and uniqueness.

However, if I wanted an anime I would have bought an anime.  I buy games for gameplay and this game is an absolute failure in the gameplay department.  Here is a few of the points that irritated me with this game and why after 1 day and only 7 levels I put it on eBay.

- Shoots that ""hit"" targets (it is obvious when you miss a target) and grenades that land 1ft from targets did no damage.
- No strategy required.  Most maps are narrow and small which basically limits you to one strategy.  You are basically limited to the strategy designed by the developers and that is it.
- A stealth mission where you are supposed to slip by the enemy to get back together with your platoon.  However, the ONE path through the level brings you in front of every trooper in the level.  Even those that you sneak behind turn around and fire on you.
- The always fun ""invinsible enemy"" level who can run all over the map in one turn and shoot her ultimate weapon that instantly kills your team.  How do you survive said level?  That's right, you have to use the one strategy designed by the developers.
- Rudimentary battlefield.  The only battle cover is tall grass, sandbags, and trenches.  However, these do not hide you from the enemy nor lower your chances from getting hit by fire.  All it provides is that it negates the auto-kill headshoot.  No protection from trees, no popping out from the sides of buildings to fire.  Basically move, shoot, move shoot.
- Weak weapon/armor/troop leveling flow chart and no weapon customization.
- No multiplayer

The difference this time is that many of the maps are open and HUGE (by CoD standards), which is nice for sniping, but if you elect not to snipe, then you're going to find yourself constantly getting shot in the back or side, simply because there's too much ground to scan while you move. On a few occasions, multiple enemies spawned about fifteen feet behind me. I've managed to shoot people who were around corners (I'm talking two-foot-thick-concrete walls with a submachine gun), and it's happened to me quite a bit as well. One change I like is the ability to lean around corners. Don't get confused, though; this game still isn't what I would consider tactical or realistic. Also, dogs instakill you and leap from about fifteen feet. However, the dogs don't even make a biting motion or anything, leaving the whole experience laughably cheesy. I'm supposed to be some kind of badass special-forces guy, but a dog jumping on my chest like I just came home from work kills me? Get real.

Single player is the usual over-the-top, generic, Michael Bay movie snorefest with zero plot, though there is a space-station battle and an underwater, scuba-diving mission that I found supremely entertaining, at least by FPS campaign standards.

The only welcome change in this game is the extinction mode, which is much more fun than the zombies modes of previous games, simply because it's boring to sit there and watch the zombies stagger their way toward you as you unload a thousand rounds into them. Extinction mode is better, in my opinion, because the enemies are faster and don't take an obscene amount of bullets to kill. The goal is destroy alien hives (which look very similar to Zerg hives from Starcraft) by planting a drill in front of the hive and defending it. Additionally, one can interact with the map, such as electrifying fences and starting fires, in order to keep the aliens in check. A major downside is that there is only one map on the disk, though there may one in DLC, but honestly, who wants to pay for that?

Despite the much-better Extinction mode, I cannot recommend this game, simply because it's too much of the same. Extinction mode simply isn't worth the asking price for the game, in my opinion. At best, this game is a two- or three-day rental, as that's probably about all the longer Extinction mode will entertain you. Either wait for Titanfall (the beta was great), or get Black Ops 2 if you have a PS3, 360, or PC.","Do your bullets even lift, bro?",1393200000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Yes, it's a Minecraft clone, but it's not a very good one. The graphics are ugly. The controls are utterly complicated. The game prides itself on the fact you don't have to equip an item. It's all context driven. The problem is when I go to water my crops the only option I'm given is to fertilize them. I can't even figure out how to build anything, and can't find a single answer online since the game is so new. Is it that the game is slow? Maybe.

* Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players.
* Online manual just says ""Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand..."", nothing on how to actually join the game.
* After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in.
* Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. Likely normal. sad. Should be a way to register the game and run the install without the disc.
* Co-op mode is terrible. It should be called something else. It is really just a single player game. If the 2nd player joins and dies. They do not automatically re-spawn, they have to wait for a timer to expire and then press a button to return.
* Camera only follows player 1 and if player 2 goes off the screen, they time out and die. If player 1 dies and player 2 is still alive, it doesn't matter. It acts like both had died and forces you back to a check point.
* For a Sony launch title, the graphics are NOT good. Feels like an older PS3 game.
* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn't good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it's one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it's just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney's Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it's better than Knack.

My pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.

IGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!

If you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.

Remember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it's a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn't good enough for a $60 new-release cost.

UPDATE: I still can't stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it's a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It's not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it's release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.

Many people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that.

1.0,True,"01 16, 2011",A2AZ2WW8ENH2XT,B001TOQ8UW,Daniel Allen Langdon,"I really wanted to like this game.  I enjoyed playing the previous Zelda game, ""Phantom Hourglass"".  The sailing part of the game was a bit tedious, but there were shortcuts and special items that let you jump from point to point.

I have no qualms with the touch-screen controls; as a matter of fact, I think that they are innovative for a hand-held Zelda game.

The action of the game is ok for the Zelda series.  Some of the boss fights, especially the later ones in the game, are rather impressive.

There are some things I could nit-pick about.  The side-quests are boring and uninspiring; especially the ""rabbit-land rescue"" quest.  I did enjoy the ""battle"" side-quest where you have to fight floors upon floors of monsters.

As I expected, this game is basically ""Phantom Hourglass"" with trains.  However, unlike the sailing in ""Phantom Hourglass"", there is absolutely no jumping from point to point without doing the slow train ride across the not-so detailed terrain, shooting rocks with a cannon and searching for rabbits for ""rabbit-land rescue"".

Remember that ever since even the first Zelda game, there have been shortcuts so that you don't have to do tedious running around (Remember ""Take any road you want?"")  Here, not only is getting around slow and tedious, but it is absolutely mandatory to go back and forth from one end of the map to the other numerous times to complete the game.  It can take more than five minutes to get from one location to another.  The mini-games and boss-fights played on the train are generally not very good, as well.  I have to restrain myself from using obscenities to describe how I feel about the train driving in this game.

I could go on and on and repeat what the other 1 and 2 star reviews say, but to sum it up, this could be a decent addition to the Zelda franchise if they hadn't made this game so tedious to complete.  I will be selling my copy and plan to never play it again.  Of all the other Zelda games I've played: ""The Legend Of Zelda"", ""Link's Adventure"", ""A Link to the Past"", ""Link's Awakening"", ""Ocarina of Time"", ""Majora's Mask"", ""Oracle of Seasons"", ""Oracle of Ages"", and ""Phantom Hourglass"", I would rather play any of them.",The worst game in the Zelda series so far!,1295136000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Infiniti Wards is a shell of the company it once was.  After Modern Warfare 2 they lost almost 60% of their top staff, pretty much all of the core game design and coder guys.  After MW3 they lost the remaining few people holding the place together.  What you were left with is the weakest of the original team put into power, holding onto only their underserved positions.  They didn't know how to make the game and didn't care half as much as they needed.  They were so used to going along for the ride anyhow.  It also doesn't help that most didn't even want to stay at the company but were told they were not wanted at the new company the original guys left to make.  To top it all off, any new talent that came in to replace those who left Infiniti have been held down and left beyond frustrated by these incapable people left in charge.

The 'AI fish guy' (the one who made a fool of himself on the internet), is one of the biggest reasons for the horrid direction of the game I've been told.  The guy was an associated producer before the company fell apart!  That coupled with a poisonous and polluted attitude clearly didn't help the game.  Can't fully blame him though, there was no on else there to help direct the game.  This atrocity that they dare call a Call of Duty didn't even have an official game director, and it shows.  It also sounds like some art guy tried to be a technical game director/dictator to replace the lack thereof, and his ideas were seemingly extremely short sighted and only pushed the game beyond limits with very superficial attempts at changes to the game in the first place.

Let's talk about the game itself.  They completely ruined what made Multiplayer fun.  Not sure if it was the direction of Mr. AI fish or the half witted MP lead, or both.  Regardless, its just plain disappointing.  Perks are no fun anymore.  You die or kill others far to quickly.  The font sizes are almost unreadable.  The maps are way to big.  The spawning is horrific!  How could they sleep at night knowing that was going to ship?!  There are some really stupid animation things going on too, like the mantling up objects, or some of the runs.  It looks retarded!  The colors of the MP maps and the character colors blend together so bad you can't even see the people you're trying to shoot at.  Almost as bad is the look of the characters faces.  They look like they have a slight 'puffer fish' look to all of them.  They should have called this damn game, 'Call of Failure: Fish'!  I'm at a loss for words besides to say, the shell of a company Infiniti Wards officially RUINED the franchise for everyone else.  It's was a sad November 5th this year for many.  If I were the top guys I would not give out any bonus payments for such a disappointment, even if the sales were good.

1.0,False,"05 15, 2011",AA78TCLHXPJOK,B0001VNNE8,Tim B.,"A few years ago, when I had just recently gotten a PS2, I was super pumped when I got this controller. It was getting great reviews, I found it to be more comfortable than the official Sony controllers, and mine was working flawlessly-- for a few months. The rubber contacts on the buttons are made out of some ridiculously cheap rubber that even the Chinese knockoff makers would probably laugh at, and it was not long before my X button started sticking when it was depressed. For fighting games like Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deception, you NEED lightning fast response from the buttons. One sticky button completely ruins this controller, and eventually all of them will wear out due to the terrible material Logitech uses.

I actually considered picking up a Logitech wireless PS3 controller at one point since it uses the same form factor, and hoping that Logitech finally learned their lesson about the crappy material, I figured it would be easy to swap out the rubber contacts from the PS3 controller to restore my PS2 controller better-than-new. However, I learned ahead of time that Logitech uses the same crappy material in the PS3 controllers, and the buttons wear out just as quickly! I will probably never buy a Logitech controller again. My official PS2 controllers still work just fine after many years of making Jak and Daxter jump platforms and doing kombos and fatalities in Mortal Kombat, and that durability is worth putting up with wires for. Logitech's terrible neglect for quality materials ruined what would have otherwise been the ultimate controller for PS2 owners.

*UPDATE*

Recently I decided to take a stab at replacing the rubber contacts on the controller for old times's sake, and now there is a new problem: the piece of junk doesn't even sync up with the receiver anymore. I have tried every single ""solution"" suggested by Logitech on their forums, and when none of them work the mods are always extremely evasive and simply start ignoring the people who are having the sync problem. Maybe not everyone is as unlucky as me as with these controllers, but I can say with confidence that a great many of them were sadly not built to last. There is no way to repair a faulty wireless transmitter as far as I can tell, so now I have a wireless controller with perfect buttons that doesn't do anything except sit their and look pretty. Logitech really dropped the ball with this controller and I feel like the terrible experience I had has soiled my opinion of their gaming products in general. Perfectly crafted ergonomics doesn't count for anything when the device simply does not work, and even my ugly Pelican wireless controller that has inferior ergonomics to the official PS2 controller still works like new, while the Logitech one has become a pretty looking brick that I have sunk too many hours into trying to rescue.

Logitech only had the official Playstation license for these controllers during their initial run, and then Sony revoked their licensing agreement, causing Logitech to release their final batch under generic branding with no Playstation symbols on it. Now we know why. Sony makes products that last for years, and Logitech's quality control and customer service did not meet the standards needed for an official Playstation product.","Promising controller, terrible quality control!",1305417600,,,

An addendum -- players might want to make a backup copy of their savegame file periodically...mine somehow got ""corrupted"" midway into the game and I had to start from the beginning which meant sitting through those agonizingly bad cutscenes a second time...that's enough to cause one to consider suicide as a viable alternative...

Also, if the developers happen to read this, why is it not possible to simply provide some decent maps -- maps large enough that Max could pick and chose how he wants to solve whatever problem he is faced with?...all this down a hallway -- bang, bang -- down an alley -- bang, bang -- up a staircase -- bang, bang -- gets pretty tedious after about five minutes...allow the player to get onto a roof, get into a sewer, use a backdoor and let him blow up something, drive something, fly something -- anything but repeat the same thing over and over and over again and again....

Having completed the game, I thought I'd post an addendum...my previous assessment that it wouldn't get any better was dead accurate...nothing but duck behind cover and shoot over and over...another gripe concerns the stupid ""collectibles""...what purpose do they serve?...the clues supposedly offer some additional information to help understand the ""mystery"" but does nothing to alter the game...pretty much ditto for the ""golden"" gun parts...collect all the parts to a gun and supposedly it increases the damage by 10% (whoopee!) and ammo capacity increases...but there are so many of them and if you choose to spend time looking around, you usually have to listen to someone nag you about hurrying up...also, some scenes, after you kill the last bad guy, automatically seg to the next scene and you can't go back unless you want to reply the entire scene over again...

...then there was my ""favorite"" (sarcasm to the infinite power) collectible -- the ""tourist locations""...collecting these garners you a ""sure know how to pick a place"" achievement award!...oh, can you bear the excitement?! (more sarcasm!)...and what this appears to consist of is finding this middle aged retired cop in Brazil doing missionary work and engaging in an absolutely meaningless conversation that contributes absolutely nothing to the game but which lasts what feels like an eternity and which you CANNOT skip!...

...finally, there's the plot...well, I still haven't figured out the plot...in the beginning, Max gets roped into bodyguarding in Brazil by a former acquaintance...initially, someone is trying to kidnap the wife of one of the characters but for no apparent purpose other than ransom...interspersed between the next several Brazilian episodes are scenes that are flashbacks to Max bing chased by thugs in New Jersey because he killed some mobster's son -- none of which has anything to do with the previous Max Payne games nor with what's going on in Brazil (I imagine Rockstar had some extra scenes from some other game and thought they may as well use them somewhere)...anyway, Max saves the wife but she goes and gets kidnapped again; this time with her sister...Max tries to save them but no luck for the wife and one of her husband's relatives...no clue at this point as to why anyone is going to so much trouble to kidnap or kill anyone...somewhere in there the husband gets killed and his office building is blown up -- why isn't clear at that point -- during which the player has to guide Max out of the burning rubble at a pace that is so agonizingly slow and BORING that one is tempted to let him roast...

...now somewhere in there a strange subplot emerges about someone selling body parts...Max finds this exceedingly offensive and feels obligated to bring it down...coincidentally, this operation is somehow linked to the main bad guy who was also the individual who was atempting the kidnapping -- something to do with him winning an election...somewhere in there Max gets to go on a ride through the Panama Canal and shhot a few people -- I have no idea how that part was relevant to the story but by that time I wasn't paying much attention -- I just wanted to get it overblows up the body parts building and ultimately works his way around to nabbing the main bad guy after one final plunking down behind cover and having to deal with at least a hundred of the usual bad guys with the usual weapons, the only difference being that one of them has a grenade launcher and you also need to shoot the grenades out of the air before they blow you up...

...the one positive thing I can say is that the bad guys were aggressive...unlike a lot of FPS games where the bad guys just dance around in the distance waiting for you to pick them off, in MP3 they come after you...unfortunately, in this game, that just translates into you being forced pretty much to shoot from cover until they're all gone...and that simply isn't very interesting -- at least not to me...",At least it couldn't get much worse...,1338768000,16,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I installed it for my PS4 racing games.  Right out of the box it does some kind of test by rotating the wheel as far right and left as it will go, making a loud clunky noise.  I knew this wheel has gears but I didn't realize how noisy and clunky it would be.  It has good force feedback, but the gears just take away any positive experience.  After trying it for a while, I noticed that when I turn on the ps4 it would turn the wheel full left and right and make a horrible sound, which may have been faulty from the factory or maybe this is normal.  Either way I was not happy with this and I returned it and got the Thrustmaster T300.  Wow, what a difference, night and day between these 2 wheels.

The T300 does the same wheel test but it's smooth and relatively quiet, because it is belt driven.  I played some project cars and hit the wall and the wheel almost took my arm off....lol.  I had to turn down the settings, because my arms were getting tired after a few laps.  This is definitely the experience I was looking for.  I would say this wheel is for kids and the Thrustmaster is for adults.

I did enjoy the leather wrapped wheel, and the pedals were amazing, but in the end the better product wins.  I wish they did sell the pedals by themselves, because they are fantastic,  but I got the T3PA pro pedals and they work great also.  I can't really give a full review because I think the wheel wasn't working right out of the box, or maybe that's just the way the gears are supposed to sound.  Just in my opinion, the Thrustmaster gives a better feel of road bumps and crashes and an overall better race experience.

1.0,False,"10 16, 2013",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B002EE1PBS,Aiex Halo,"Starting off with, I'm a gamer who frequently plays games in windowed mode, as I like to have easy access to my desktop and messenger and e-mail while gaming, and my monitor is big enough to accommodate.  There is absolutely no excuse for a modern game like this one to not have a Windowed mode of any sort.  Even Grand Theft Auto 4 had windowed mode.  At the very least, Dead Rising 2 can be forced into windowed mode via a third party program, but it makes the mouse cursor disappear, forcing you to navigate by keys alone, or blindly.

But that's the least of the frustrations inherent in this game.  It's also the first game that's caused me to angrily smash my keyboard and scream in frustration since I stopped being a child and mostly grew up.  For reasons I cannot begin to comprehend, the game has no autosave feature, and you can only save at bathrooms, which are shockingly not nearly as common as they are in real life, so any time I get trapped in a big dumb horde of zombies and killed, or the game decides to crash, or I fail a mission by running out of time, I have to re-start from my last manual save.  On four straight occasions, I had to redo the same set of missions due to exactly this.

Getting it out of the way early, the story.  I'm only about two hours in, and I already could not conceivably care less about anyone here except for two survivors I picked up, LaShawndra and her pusillanimous husband Gordon, and I interacted with them for all of a 4 minute miussion.

I have no idea what they were intending with the characters, but they come across as stereotypes at best, and grating irritants at worst.  In particular, the women.  Video games and misogyny have a fun and delicate relationship, but I must have been lucky to go so many years without such a startlingly blatant, on-the-nose, completely un-self-aware example in a game (Duke Nukem and the like are obviously comic over-the-top nuttery) such as I've found in this one.

There are two main female characters I've encountered thus far:  Stacey, the activist leader of C.U.R.E. who are against abuse of zombies for some odd reason, and portrayed without a hint of irony as a strong-willed, spirited dame just looking for a big strong man to tame her.

The other is Rebecca Chang, whom they've gone so over the top with making her a Femme Fatale that she comes across as a complete and utter raging bitch.  It gave me no amusement at all when a cutscene had her blatantly bending over and a subtle zoom in on her butt, and she spends the rest of her time constantly berating you and acting 'sassy' and blas when a huge horde of zombies swarm in on us.

The only other female characters worth mentioning are the twins from the prologue, reinforcing the misogyny by being intentionally designed to be complete and utter raging bitches, with nothing but insults to the main character, regardless of whether he wins the opening Terror In Reality game or not.

Then there's the cutscenes.  For the prologue and first mission I literally sat through more cutscene time than game time.  There's way too many cutscenes, which flow poorly, drone on with background mess and clutter, sometimes interrupting gameplay sequences, and overall could easily be replaced with a quick text notification.  In particular, the cutscenes advertising the first maintenance room where you can combine weapons actually took longer than it did to actually combine two things into a new weapon.

At the very least, these cutscenes are all skippable, but when they hit right in the middle of action, they can be distracting.

Now, to the gameplay.

The concept is good, and most of the time, picking up random garbage (sometimes literal garbage) and hitting zombies with it (or throwing it) is fun, and there's a real incentive to actually ""upgrade"" weapons, such as combining nails with a bat or tying a machete to a broomstick, but the fun only lasts as long as the weapon does.  And the weapons always break.  And there's absolutely nothing you can do to repair them or make them last longer.

In fact, given the sometimes arbitrary nature of some of the combinations (as in, you can attach a machete to a stick, but not any other blade), and other combinations that are little more than funny gimmicks, like combining fireworks with a lizard mask, and putting it on a zombie so the mask shoots fireworks.  The amusement lasts only as long as you realize it does no damage and actually draws more zombies towards you.

I've literally had instances where I completely gave up and dropped my newly-crafted weapons (like the Snow Cannon, fire extinguisher plus super soaker) for a big wooden stick because it's just not good enough for the situation.  The weapons are frilly and gimmicky, but when the game throws scores and scores of zombies at you all the time, especially this early in the game, it's not worth dicking around with a weapon that is one-time use or only hits one zombie at a time when you need large area-of-attack weapons like sledgehammers or tomahawks just to get across a hallway.

Similarly, a lot of the combat animations seem poorly chosen, made just to look cool at the expense of gameplay or logic.  For one, when a zombie grabs you from behind, your characters makes the highly questionable choice of throwing his own body back to smash its head on the ground.  Most of the time, this means your character is throwing his own body back INTO the large group of zombies he was running away from.

Other animations, particularly certain special attacks, require an extra half-second or so for the character to do his wind-up dance, or the stupid recovery time from certain cool-downs or missed attacks.  And given the annoying nature of zombie grabs, it means that you're practically guaranteed to be grabbed by a zombie if you try to use a frilly special weapon that takes too long to ""deploy"", such as the Power Guitar.  Adding to the frustration is that to escape the zombie grabs, you have to wiggle your mouse side to side, and most of the time, you will lose a health point as soon as you're grabbed, meaning you could end up dying while trying to run through lines of zombies, and end up having to reload back to wherever you last manually saved.

For a big budget game charging full dollar, this is a bit much, though I would deem it all tolerable and yet still fun if not for the TIME LIMIT.

The basis of the story is, the military is coming into town in 3 days, so everyone just has to sit and wait, with Chuck maybe going out to save some survivors left out in the strip mall.  Except that Total Bitch Rebecca Chang airs a news report that implicates Chuck as a C.U.R.E. terrorist who unleashed the zombies on everyone, so Chuck has to go and find evidence that proves his innocence somehow.  As well, his daughter is infected, and needs daily doses of a medicine called Zombrex which bitten people can take and keep living as humans.

This time limit doesn't even run in real time; I went running from one end of the mall to the other, then outside, then to the arena, and rescued a redneck couple.  It took me at most 15-20 minutes total.  In-game, 3 HOURS had passed.  Even spending a few seconds saving to a new save slot had several MINUTES pass in-game.  And unlike games like Grand Theft Auto, the countdown clock doesn't display minutes as passing like seconds, but appears in allegedly real time.

As well, there's a time limit on every mission you're given, from the main quest to secondaries to rescuing survivors.  There's even a time limit on having NO MISSION AT ALL; in between two main mission quests, it said ""Stacey has nothing for you at this time"" and to wait for her to call me.  This tidbit was running down its timer even with no mission at all, and went down into the red before I received a text message from her calling me back to base, with barely enough time to go out anywhere from the starting area.  And the mission wasn't even urgent!

It makes sense to add some layer of realism in terms of survivor missions (as in, time is running out to save group A, while group B is closer, but if you go after group A, you might run out of time to save group B), but it creates for ridiculous issues when you start running out of time for non-emergency missions, or when you fail the entire game if you're 1 second late to your destination, literally at the door.

If it weren't for those damn timers, in a supposed sandbox game, I would've given this mess 3 stars.  Overall, it's a mess, and the graphics on the zombies and gore look rather cheap for a 2010 game.

On the plus side, the Psychopaths are absolutely perfectly written to be some of the absolute worst scum of the earth deserving to die in the absolute most slow, painful, vicious ways possible, as well as making them some of the most disgustingly unbalanced, overpowered bosses in the game.",Cheap mess,1381881600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I think this is a product that's either a sure-thing 5 stars, or sure-thing 1 star based on your hearing sensitivity, annoyance threshhold, and mic usage. If you have sensitive hearing, get annoyed easily, or use the mic a ton, this headset is likely to be a really bad experience.

There's an annoying buzz in the right ear of these headphones whenever the microphone's ""room ambiance cancel tech"" is active. Because the mic is so sensitive, this tech will frequently enable and disable itself, which made me even more aware of it. And as soon as you're aware of it, it's stuck permanently.

Worst part? It's not just a lemon or a problem with the headset - this is part of their firmware and built into every single one.

If you don't have sensitive hearing, you might be able to totally ignore it and love these headphones. And if you don't use the mic often, they might be great too. They're very comfortable and easy to use. Battery was great. Stand felt great.

1.0,True,"09 27, 2016",A6I14JYCIPSPE,B00KPM9BWQ,MEATY,"UPDATE: After only 4 uses and less than a week, the controller no longer works correctly. The R2 trigger is intermittent and works when it wants to. So it was useless as a mod controller, and now is 100% useless as a standard controller. Sending it back.

Let me start by saying that I'm a casual gamer in my mid-30's, and my intended game of choice for this controller was for Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 1. I assumed that many of the ""skilled"" players on multiplayer must be using some type of modded controller to advance in the game as I found myself shooting others long before they shot at me but I would always be the first to die in the game. With that, I thought I would try to level the playing-field with a modded controller. I wanted a standard-looking controller that would allow me to shoot faster, aim better, and give me that advantage and while it seemed to-good-to-be-true; it was.

[Arrival and first thoughts] It was packaged in the standard Sony packaging like any other controller that is store bought. It appeared brand new, and there's no doubt that it was only opened by BlackZone to be modded. Controller didn't have any scratches at all indicating it was used or even opened so I will say that the person taking these apart is taking extra care not to chew up screw heads or scratch up the plastic. The instruction booklet references Xbox 360 buttons and copyrights, but shows PS4 pictures and diagrams. There's only 4 pages to the manual, and honestly it was a little frustrating trying to flip through the book while gaming so I wrote the information on a single sheet of paper. This ""manual"" could have easily fit on a single page for quick-reference for those attempting to learn it. While the commands to activate and store the desired function seem a little cumbersome at first, I believe that if the mods were effective enough to be worthwhile, you could memorize them easily with time.

[Effectiveness] Again, this was tested on BF4 and bought it on the premise that it works with BF4. While rapid-fire WORKS, it is useless. The game has delays on all single-shot weapons that do not allow you to fire it faster than a certain threshold. Your finger can fire the single-shot modes just as fast as the rapid fire function can. Automatic weapons set to ""single shot"" mode do not fire any faster than when left on ""auto"" mode & recoil is the same. Perhaps if you want to run around rapid-firing a pistol for the entire game this controller will work for you. Sniper Quickscope mod is useless. All it does is make the trigger that is used to aim down the sight fire the gun when you release it. It doesn't enhance anything, it's basically a function that automatically hits the right trigger when you let go of the left. Dropshot is also useless. It does in fact drop you to the ground when you fire, but the way this works is: it fires a shot or two at your enemy, THEN it drops you to the floor creating a delay, then you have to re-aim upwards at the enemy and it continues to shoot again. Each time I used it I was killed just after making it to the ground due to this long drop delay.

[Issues] Let's say you DO find a weapon in BF4 that the rapid-fire mode will actually enhance your experience by using it. Well, you'll have to be quick with enabling and disabling rapid fire if you ever need to switch to a gadget that requires a long press (for example the engineers repair tool; it needs to be HELD to activate and use it, you can't repair anything by rapidly tapping the trigger on it). Enabling and disabling mod functions requires you to hold a trigger and tapping the d-pad. Doing this while in battle switches your weapons or fires them in the process.

[Final Thoughts] I was excited to receive this controller, but only to be let down completely. I find myself just switching all the mod features off and leaving them off. So at this point it's just an overpriced regular controller. Maybe it will work on another game in the future for me, but at this time I feel like I completely wasted $119. Which brings me to my next frustration, the day after I purchased it for $119, it dropped to $109. Knowing what I know now, I honestly wouldn't have paid much more than $60 for this controller.  Don't expect this thing to give you any advantages in the Battlefield series of games, maybe it will work for other games but I seldom play much else.",Battlefield Players; PLEASE READ,1474934400,21,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71igY+Js37L._SY88.jpg']

The sloppy physics and lack of realism didn't seem like as big of an issue since the game was mostly focused on crazy stunts like Takedowns and Crash modes.  I considered the game more in the same vein as Twisted Metal, vehicular combat, rather than true racing -- and that was okay.  Burnout Paradise did what it set out to do and it did it very well.  I highly recommend that game.

Then Criterion Games produced Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.  And although a lot of people railed on it for being too radical a departure from the series, it was its own IP and rather than get upset over how un-NFS it was, I viewed it as what it was, Need For Speed: Burnout.  Almost everything about that game from the stage selection on down was copied from Burnout.  It wasn't bad but wasn't the experience I had been hoping for from NFS.  I had loved Shift, I think it was one of the best NFS games ever made, but Shift 2 was a sore disappointment due to a combination of mindless drone AI and the tendency to spin out at the slightest tap from the drones.  After churning out another arcade racer, The Run, I figured the next NFS game would a simulation racer.  You would think they were due for another sim racer now, right?  At the bare minimum I thought it might fall in the middle as the original Most Wanted wasn't pure sim or pure arcade but somewhere in between.  Wrong, what we got was another Burnout.

Need for Speed: Most Wanted should truthfully be called Need For Speed: Burnout 2.  Setting aside the fact that this is absolutely nothing like the first Most Wanted game, frankly I'm just getting sick of playing Burnout.  I'm just tired of the sloppy, unrealistic car movements.  It's a mockery of how real cars handle.  Burnout cars just doesn't feel like cars.  You're controlling these things and they are vehicles and they move around but they're not cars.  Unlike many previous NFS games, you can't choose how realistic you want the cars to handle, like every Burnout game in the past, you're stuck on CARTOON physics.  I really wanted to like this game, the backgrounds look amazing, the graphics look great, but it has as much realism as Mario Kart.  I could be playing this, getting frustrated at why the vehicles can't corner properly, or I could be actually developing real skills playing Gran Turismo, Shift, or another sim.

It perfected the genre of Survival Horror and created a cult following immediately. Even today it is one of the most successful franchises in game history and definitely a large part of the bread and butter at CAPCOM. However it did not achieve this status for nothing. With every CLASSIC game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system. The Resident Evil series from the beginning was developed with exploration and puzzle solving in mind. Then the graphical presentation was developed to supply enough detail and interest that a person would actually want to explore it. The setting, in a mansion full of horror story influences, was perfect for the type of game style that was being developed. At the time they used static backgrounds due to the fact that the Sony Playstation system couldn't display enough polygons to make a believable environment. But doing it this way also proved to make the graphical presentation much smoother and more detail rich. Later the series would try full 3D in Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast, and then return to it's roots on GameCube in perhaps the best looking game to date. Resident Evil Gaiden for GBC was perhaps an unrealistic attempt from the beginning. The gameplay has completely changed so dramatically that it becomes a new game with a Resident Evil logo. It resembles more of a Metal Gear 8-bit Nintendo game from the 80's than a Resident Evil game. The battle system is completely boring and overly hard. It is more like a game of golf because you have to hit the button at the right time on a progress bar that scrolls left to right before you can shoot a zombie in combat mode. It's tricky and timing is everything. But, more importantly it just doesn't fit the RE universe and it is a poor attempt to port a name over to a dead handheld system with way too little power for such a detail/exploration latent game as RE. The graphics are horrible even for GBC standards and the battle system is poorly developed and there is no since this is even a RE game at all. Invest in something else, anything else. For 20 bucks more you could have RE for GameCube, the best RE there is. Stay away from this game I promise you will be taking it back the next day to trade for something else.

It's overpriced with no quality control so you're paying for the Corsair name being on it rather than a high price because it's a good product.

The way the headset fits is uncomfortable and will cause headaches / become painful unless used in small amount.

The volume adjuster on the cord really breaks easily/overheats a lot so it's best not to leave bare skin exposed near it.

The mic is trash and constantly has buzzing/static whenever you try to use it. I paid for a headset not just a nice pair of headphones and at this price having only half the product work right is really not acceptable. I shipped back and tried replacing this headset 3 times and each time it had the same defect that Corsair likes to pretend doesn't exist and at $18+ each time you have to return this defective piece of crap to them it's easy to double the price you actually pay for these trying to get a fully working pair.

Pros:
The headphones themselves are actually very very nice with great sound quality but that's the only good part and you could easily find a cheaper headphone only pair by someone else.

Other Thoughts:
In the end I fell back to using my Logitech USB Headset H530 and even held together with tape the mic still works better than this one so it's only been used literally 8 times since I bought it a year ago on the rare occasion I wanted to make use of it's superior headphones.

I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.

Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.

I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change.

The game ended in a big disappointment. In Cod4 multiplayer games, I always get 1-3 in place every match so you can say that I don't suck at fps, but this game just gave some high blood pressure problem throughout the gameplay. A lot of stuff is unreasonable.

AI is stupid. Your team can barely hit anyone, but the enemy can pretty much snipe you with a handgun over 50 feet and more. Your team doesn't do crap, one time the enemy walked up to one of my guy and they both just stood there. And you can never tell where you're being shot at, so forget it if you get shot once, you'll be dead before you find them. There is also no timeline sort of thing where your military higher-up goes ""forward!"", and the battle will go on as long as it has to (the flood of the enemies will just come not stop), unless you risk yourself and go forward----only then your teammates will actually forward and story goes on (for the most part anyways).

Anyways, there is a lot of bullcrap like many other reviewers stated, and I as well ended up cursing, shouting, and scratching my head throughout the gameplay. Don't buy this game if you don't the patience because this game isn't quick-and-clean fast paced fps game like cod4 is. Also don't buy this game if you got a anger problem and trying to take it out on a game because you'll just make yourself more angrier. I want my money back now.

THIS IS AN ALMOST NEW VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL."" i say this because i have the sega cd version along with the sega cd strategy guide and the levels have been changed completely and the difficulty has been AMPED! random encounters have been eliminated completely, which, in this case, ends up being a very, VERY bad thing. once you kill the visible enemies on the screen in a dungeon, swamp or mountain terrain, the enemies disappear completely. even when you move up a floor and then go back, they are still gone. this means to level up(AND YOU WILL HAVE TO LEVEL UP!) you have to walk ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE ENTRANCE, THEN ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TOWN, AND THEN ALL THE WAY TO THE STATUE TO HEAL! THEN YOU HAVE TO RETURN TO THE FIGHTING SCENE AND KILL THE ENEMIES ALL OVER AGAIN! this is very bad as there are only 3 different types of enemies per area which makes things mind-numbingly monotonous. i spent 6 hours leveling up my characters near the city of vann to only barely avoid death with the following boss. it will be that way the whole game. no matter how much you level up, you will BARELY escape death with the bosses and that's only if you've dedicated 4-6 hours of grinding for each section. also, the enemies 30 hours in the game give you the same amount of experience points and almost the same amount of money as at the beginning of the game. that's what makes this game so damn frustrating and boring. you have to run through an area to kill 10 enemies and then leave, heal, and re-enter when the enemies only give you 20 experience points per fight and you need to build up 9000 experience points to move on. also, i'm using the same magic 30+ hours in the game that i used at the beginning. the new spells you learn on the way are total crap and are weaker than the spells you start off with. how is it that i'm granted a majic spell at level 21 that's weaker than the spells i had at level 1? i wouldn't be griping about this at all if they would have just left the random encounters in the game. atleast then the makers could justify the unnecessary ""new and improved"" difficulty level. it would have made grinding so much more tollerable and far less time consuming. this game was so much fun when i bought it back in 1994 for the sega cd. now, i'm so bored with it that i'm quitting. it's taken me over 30 hours to get to a spot that only took me one evening on the original. i will give it this, if you want character development, this is the lunar to get as they have beefed up the story and have vastly improved the translation. this leads, however, to this lunar being completely, COMPLETELY different from the original. i know because i have both. if you need proof, just look at the sega cd strategy guide and then look at the manual for this game.

The game has troubles with support for any hardware with an on-board graphics processor, along with a dedicated GPU (such as an NVIDIA or ATI card).  The game will install fine, but upon launching it an error code will pop up.  After searching the web for a long time, I stumbled across a solution that will bypass the error by simply adding a line of code through the ""Launch Settings"" option in Steam.  Unfortunately, the game will then launch using the on-board GPU, and what a disaster that is.  You have to set everything on low or off, and at that point you might as well buy it on console.  In fact, my console version runs better and looks better than it does on my Qosmio X875-Q7380.  I've tried actually gone into device manager and disabled the integrated graphics, so then the game would be forced to use the dedicated card, but it still solved nothing.

I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.

For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.

WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.

The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.

It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.

Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault.

Two Worlds was something I had waited for.  Touted as The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion on steroids, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this; and as most things that get over hyped this one, too, fell on it's face and left a nasty mark.

Pros:  There are not many.  Character customization is simple. Game play is simple, press the button and bash something.  You can create your own weapons by combining two like weapons or adding an item, such a gem, to make the weapon stronger.  This also works with clothing (armor), and you can make your own spells by picking ingredients (if you can find them) in the wilderness.

You can not die, well you do, but instead of having to reload a prior save you are instantly ""resurrected"" at one of the many, many shrines you find along the road.

Cons: Story, if there is one somewhere, is your typical Fantasy fare.  You are the heir to a magic thingamabob, only you can use said magic thingamabob, bad guys want magic thingamabob, kidnapped your sister to force you to comply and go get / find magic thingamabob, blah-blah-blah, yawn.

The graphics are sub-par for what one has come to expect from the next-gen consoles.  You'd swear you were playing Gauntlet (arcade style graphics) or Baldur's Gate.  YIKES!  People look melted and backgrounds, although nicely done, tend to be muddy and mush into one big blob of grey-green space indiscernible from one area to another.

There is no tutorial, so to speak, and the on screen text will make you go blind, it is so bad you CAN NOT read it.  Legibility is the key to making a game fun for me!

The in game map is as close to useless as one can get, with no text or the same illegibility problem, navigating the rather large world takes some doing.

The voice acting is terrible!  I play with MUTE on!  I'm sure they tried very very hard and such a valiant  effort, but it is difficult to take all the ""Forsooth""-ing and ""Varlet""-ing when it is used in every sentence, it just kills the game.

Some people might think this is unduly harsh, but the video gaming talent pool is unbelievably high. However, GTA V is more like Hollywood and its endless cycle of reboots, reshoots and sequels.

Sure, the GTA V map terrain is a little more detailed, the mountains have higher peaks, and the cars look and handle a bit better. But Driver-SF still pips it with a higher frame-rate, and Saints Row III is just more fun. The rest is just bland, bland, bland.

========================================
Update April 2014
========================================

To those who argue the graphics are great and that negative reviewers have never played the game...

First off the graphics aren't first rate. They were back in 2008 with GTA4 maybe, but not now! At best GTA5's graphics are an incremental improvement over GTA4, but not enough considering the long development time. There are now vastly superior open-world driving titles with better graphics such as Driver-San Francisco, and even that isn't anything new. (And no, I'm no fan of Ubisoft and their DRM from hell before you ask).

The graphics are poor in GTA5 and its because they've failed to develop their Rage engine. You can see it in the frame Rate and Rendering. During a chase scene especially, the graphics of GTA lack clarity and are more blurry than Driver-SF, and this is primarily because the frame rate is much lower in GTA, and because the rendering system lacks clarity!

Its possible there are more meshes and varying terrains and landscapes with more animations in GTA. But Driver-SF is just more clever in how it renders the scene, and ultimately this is a high-paced driving game and so clarity really matters. The game could have been improved upon before release. But I think the development team have become decadent and lazy because of past success. Also, a lot of their better developers have left, especially in Rockstar North!

I played the game for 60+ hours, so I think that counts as having played it. Yes, there's a lot to do as there was in the GTA3 series and which GTA4 lacked. But its all very repetitive and not well thought out. In short there's nothing new here, and it lacks the charm of earlier titles. For example aircraft in the game still handle poorly. And while you can steal a jet from the military base and take it for a ride, you only get seconds of fuel to go joyriding! The tanks are too slow and boring too and there's only incremental improvement in the bikes and cars. I prefer driving real cars in open-world driving games, and there's too few exotic and interesting cars in this franchise to keep my attention. Who wants to drive a Truck? This is a video game, so I want to drive a Ferrari!

Don't get me started about the AI either. Rockstar just haven't done anything new in this area. Player actions on the city are non-existent also, and this is a wasted opportunity if ever there was one.

There's a lot of swearing because the game is shallow with its never ending 2-bit gangster portrayals. The earlier series had lots of swearing too but they had more charm. When swearing exists just to hide a dearth of new ideas, that's when the series becomes stale and should be dropped.",Italy?... China?... Underwater?.... Space? ...

Anubis II, however, actually has some more differences to it than just the graphics. Anubis II actually has completely different level designs, with the exception of the intro level, and there's actually more than 4 levels this time around!

Unfortunately, this game has even more problems than others of its caliber.
Like before, you have to use a god-awful control scheme. The Z button is to jump, and you have to shake the Wii Remote to attack if you don't want to jump on an enemy, hoping you'd hit it either way. Btw, the game never tells you you can jump with Z, rather does it want you to shake THE NUNCHUCK to do so. You can also do a shooting attack, but not only do you stop dead in your tracks, but it is as equally unreliable as your other moves.

While the levels in the other Conspiracy atrocities may have been hilariously bad, they were at least in a linear sense and not difficult to complete! Here, it's a frickin' chore!

Maybe they can never dream up more creative ways of generating suspense and mystery other than the ol' ""Who am I?""  XIII's main character is so devoid of colour, so boringly voiced and humourless, that even if the game itself were fun, the very fact that you have to play as an utter nerd for a main character just cripples the experience.

But this game isn't fun, either.  Half of this game is an example of just how horribly wrong a stealth game can be when the elements aren't right.

As a shooter this game fares somewhat better, but not much more.  Enemies strafe even faster than you and reloading takes forever, and their shots are so accurate that taking cover doesn't really help.  This game is also extremely stingy about giving you ammo (an average enemy drops maybe two shotgun shells and 10-20 bullets).  Frustrating, but at least there's action.  The stealth part, on the other hand, is plain garbage for a couple of reasons:

- Who came up with the idea of helmets?  I can't remember another single stealth game where a headshot doesn't kill an enemy.  In fact, the very concept of stealth games is impossible without headshot kills -- unless you have alternate methods of distracting or killing the enemy (Metal Gear Solid's choke/neck-break and noise distractions, for example).

- I don't know where main character ""Number XIII"" learned how to shoot, because even un-helmeted enemies seldom die with a headshot.  I've tested this by activating an invincibility cheat code, walking straight up to an enemy, and blasting him in the face.  Nope, still alive and kicking.

- No radar.  The ""sixth sense"" in this game which is supposed to replace this basic function is useless, because it tells you where enemies are by means of the ""tap, tap"" of approaching footsteps.  Which means you won't be able to spot an enemy who's a foot to your right, just offscreen.

- When special events occur, they use a ""window-in-window"" technique which is interesting visually (a comic-book device), but unhelpful to the player.  You don't know where these events take place in relation to your current location.  And sometimes, you hear an important conversation that's somewhere in your vicinity, but the game doesn't tell you where it's coming from.

Give me No One Lives Forever anyday, if first-person stealth/action shooters are your thing.  Cate Archer can kick ""Number XIII""'s butt any day, and say more interesting things along the way.  I bought XIII from the bargain bin and wish I'd gotten myself a nice dinner instead.

I thought this game would be similar to the sims 1 and the sims bustin out. Instead they tried to be ""hip"" and ruined the whole game. The best thing about the game is that it is really short and the black eyed peas did the music.

The loading time is very long,in fact I bet if you added up all the loading time, its longer than the actual gameplay. You carry your furniture around with you and the furniture is different in every district which I thought was annoying.

Every district is different. There are the goths, the artsy people etc.. When you go to different districts you get a job. I thought this was going to be cool because in Bustin' out you didn't get to see your sim at work. But it all turns out to be boring. You press different buttons on your controller in different combinations to perform your tasks. Some of the jobs were cute and funny (like training pet ferrets) but the button pressing was very boring and repetitive. They missed a perfectly good opportunity to be inventive.

Its all about climbing the social ladder, impressing people, and proving how cool you are etc Every night each district has a party at a club but you have to have the right reputation to get into the club and wear the right clothes or you won't be able to get past the bouncer. So for example, when you come back from the artsy district don't think you are going to get into the hip hop club dressed like andy warhol.

Changing your outfit when you go to different districts was very annoying. If you wear the wrong clothes in the wrong district the natives will insult your clothes. But if you have a great rep they will start dressing like you. I thought the whole point of having the different clothes, hairstyles, etc was to be able to make your sim look the way YOU wanted?

At the club a dude dressed like a Run DMC reject will teach you a power social move that will help you impress others and get a reputation faster. But the characters all are exagerated stereotypes with stupid names. The game tries really hard to be funny but its just corny.

 Unlike in the other games your character couldn't even get married and have kids which I thought was lame. There were no real goals in the game, its all about fitting in and impressing characters that were irritating.

Unfortunately this game is by far the worst game I've played on Xbox 360.  Viva Pinata and Lego Star Wars are better than this game.  In fact I can honestly say this is the worst game I've EVER played. (and I have a pretty sizeable game library)  I'll start with the good, since there is so much wrong with this game.

Pros:  1) Breaking the sound barrier while flying.  Hands down this is the best part of the game.  If you want to experience this, download the demo on XBL.
2) Huge open ended city.  This city is designed to be seen from a distance.  If you look closely you'll notice the programmers used copy and past for a lot of buildings and textures
3) Easy Xbox 360 achievement points.  You can unlock all of the achievement points in about 12 hours of gameplay.  (even less than that if you don't go for the ""12 hours of gameplay"" achievement)
4) Ummm... that's it!

Cons:  1) REPETATIVE!!  The bad guys in between bosses are all the same!  There's no variety!  The main bosses all have about 3 lines that they repeat over and over and over again!  To quote Will Ferrell from Zoolander, ""They're all the same!!  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!""
2)  Not fun!  This is the greatest sin a video game can commit!  The game started off fun, but after 6 hours of playing I'm so frustrated I can't take it anymore.  My wife even commented that it's not even fun to watch.
3)  Poor controls.  The controls are great if you're just flying around exploring the city, but once you get into a battle things quickly devolve.  The lock on system is terrible.  If you lock on to the wrong thing (a pedestrian or car instead of the bad guy) you can't just cycle through the available things to lock on (like every other game where you can lock on to things) you have to unlock, get your curser right on the guy you want and try to lock on again.  As bad guys are constantly moving this quickly becomes a game of trial and error.  The super speed button is great when you start flying and want to go straight up.  It's also great for flying far above the city, but trying to use it while close to the ground or during a battle is horrid.  For these situations it needs to be more of a gradual speed up.  You're going 20 mph one second and 200 the next.  It's very easy to fly right past your target and run into cars and buildings.  That's another complaint!  If you're superman, the man of steel, flying faster than the speed of sound and you run into a building, that building won't stop you.  You should fly right through that building, not the case with this game.  You simply leave a small dent in the building as you come to a complete stop.  It's the same story while running and being completely halted by cars.
4)  No story!  In between fighting the same guys over and over you see clips from the movie.  (They're not really from the movie; it's animated but the voice acting sounds like the stars from the movie)
5) Did I mention how repetitive this game is?

To sum things up, breaking the sound barrier is fun; everything else about this game is NOT!  Now that Superman Returns is in the bargain bin, it MIGHT be worth it if you're really hard up for quick easy achievement points.  But those points come with a price; it may be the longest 12 hours you spend in front of your TV.  For the same monetary price I'd recommend Lego Star Wars.  It's a lot more fun!

- not really completely wireless. this is more likely MS's fault than anyone else. if they're not going to figure out Bluetooth then they need to figure out a no latency wireless protocol or other tech to get rid of ALL the damn wires. They get tangled up when you store them away and it's REALLY annoying. The additional adapter that plugs into the bottom of the controller is additionally annoying. It's 2015, figure it out.
- no feedback/monitoring (you can't hear yourself). MS's own headset also has this problem. Again, it's 2015. What the hell is this about? You'll be yelling to hear yourself. People that are hard-of-hearing do this. It's annoying to you and you'll be annoying to other people so that's doubly annoying.
- the color scheme / style doesn't really feel like it matches that of the Xbox. The black might pass, be the other colors don't make any sense. The green stripe in the white set doesn't match any Xbox green in their color scheme...like some jackass in marketing just said ""what color should we make it?"" and some other idiot said ""green....those xbox jerks like green."" ""what type of green?"" ""bah, doesn't matter...let's just shove it out the door."" I guess this is nitpicky but I'm not sure why? not many after-market brands out there seem to be able to figure out these very difficult concepts like color and paint.

CON
- firmware was necessary just to get things working somewhat (didn't fix the mic problem however). for a  $100+ set, this seem rather lousy.
- The mic is not near your mouth so it would need to be EXTRA sensitive. It isn't. They screwed this up so bad they had to release an extra attachment to get it to work properly. I registered 2 of these headsets at polk.com, but over a month later, nothing arrived. I had to call to get them to send something and they still haven't. It would help if they would show a picture of this boom mic thing so I could see what it looks like and try to conceive of how it might help (or be yet another additional problem). Since the original mic is designed to be retractable, I assume this boom attachment will stick out and render the retractibility useless.
- Separately from the mic's insensitivity is the pressure required to get it to retract or release. I nearly sent my first set back because I had to press down so hard to get it to stick (retract inside) I thought I might break it. I thought it was broken because it wouldn't stick. A 2nd set also had this problem.
- For whatever reason, the mic didn't initially seem to work at all on either set. Flat out no response. Then after retracting and multiple times it magically worked. Will it stop working at some point? Is the connection loose? It's really hard to have faith in this product.

I tested this set with what everyone uses: Call of Duty, regular Xbox chat, Titanfall, Halo, etc...

NOTE
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU READ IN OTHER REVIEWS OR THE Q&A, NEITHER OF MY 2 HEADSETS CAME WITH THE BOOM MIC. BOTH WERE IMMEDIATELY REGISTERED WITH POLK BUT I HAD TO CALL THEM TO GET THEM TO SEND AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO AUTOMATICALLY SEND IT TO YOU. POLK REQUESTS/REQUIRES PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS WHEN YOU REGISTER. WHY PHONE NUMBER? THAT'S EXCESSIVE.

For 15 days before I bought the 500's and tried them but the interference was awful, plus they didn't have built in rechargeable batteries.

I contacted turtle beach about how tight the 300's were and they said this was by design, so I was reluctant to try the 510's. I haven't experienced the same problem however so I kept them. I have experienced two other issues that you should consider before buying these and TB should not be proud of.

Issue 1) Auto Shut-off: These headsets turn off if the source of audio is ""too quiet"". I have these hooked up to my computer via creative's DDL with optical link and blue-tooth. With this sound card any digital hook-up has zero volume control. Instead it sends sound out at one volume that cannot be adjusted, which in my case happens to mean that my music on media player must be set at 10% or higher to keep the audio level ""above the threshold"" for the auto-shut off timer. This is a problem because sometimes my games don't play sound above that threshold, which means I need to keep media player in the background just to keep the headset on. Which is distracting, and no one should ever have to make such compromises on such an expensive piece of equipment. The auto-shut off is non-programmable.

Issue 2) Audio: if you plan on using these for computer, when you're not actively listening to something, the digital processor at the transmitter turns off IMMEDIATELY, and takes seconds to turn back on. This translates to: the first few seconds of any song you play, or any game, audio test, ANYTHING is cut-off because the transmitter simply isn't on. To fix this I must keep music playing in the background at 10% at ALL times if I don't want to experience this. This headset wasn't expressly made for pc, but TB had to know that a $300 headset wouldn't sit at one console in its life cycle.

Remember that to use these for computer you will need something with DDL, and a blue-tooth adapter on the pc.

Programmability: Now on to the rest of the review, the reason I bought this headset was for the programmable microphone. See I play at night on the Xbox a lot, so I have to whisper. Almost all headsets don't pick up on whispers though, so I hoped these could be programmed to. They are, but it's not simple at first glance. Specifically you must turn up not the XBL and BT output volume or even the silencer threshold, but for XBL and even computer games to pick up on your voice you need to boost the equalizer. When you do this you will be able to whisper now. 5 stars

As for the rest of the programming options, I haven't got into that because it's complex and from the looks of it you can do almost anything you want. Very promising potential to adjust it exactly the way you want. N/A stars

Comfort: they don't hurt, unlike the 300's. I have worn them for hours on end without issue. 4 stars

Audio: I'm no audiophile so I can't say much. They work, and do have bass. They seem fine. 4  stars

Blue-tooth: this works on my phone, on my computer, google voice, and so on. Seems to work like a blue-tooth should.  Everything I've tried works and without interference. 5 stars

Wireless: I personally don't experience much issue with the interference on these headphones. Sure occasionally I get static or something here and there but it's never been an issue and some of it is to be expected. I have noticed that it does work better when the left ear cup is closer to the transmitter. 4  stars

Transmitter: I like the stand for the headset, but Issue 2 is a problem for me. I wish there was still a headphone jack for friends. For issue 2 I give it 2 stars, because I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to keep it working right.

Microphone: It's programmable in any way you want, what's not to like? 5 stars

XBL adapter: it works without issue so far, sometimes I accidently bump the button on it with my belly while gaming so watch out for that. 4  stars

Charging cable: it's long and it works, but you can feel it pointing down on your shoulder. Makes me worried that I might wear the connection port out one day from this, 4  stars

Data Cable: it's a little too short, you'll need a laptop or move you xbox to your monitor to use this. 3 stars

Surround Sound: it's not breath taking, but it's nice. Honestly I didn't fiddle with this too much and feel that it could be better. But again, I didn't play with the settings on this speaker positioning enough on this to give it a fair review. So I'll just go with 4 stars for now

Overall I'm happy with the headset. I didn't experience issue 1 while on the Xbox. I haven't used it on the PS3 yet, save for Netflix. While browsing on Netflix the auto-off did kick in, and it's F annoying. However during console gaming and actual streaming I had no issue myself.  I would buy these again, but if someone made the same thing without issue 1 I wouldn't.

sorry for the long review

UPDATE: 6/1/2014

It turns out, these aren't worth it. I'm playing Hitman: Blood Money on the 360 with all the game sounds set to %100 and the power saving feature keeps turning my headset off, so I have to leave my wireless headset plugged into it's charger just so they stay turned on. so everything I said before about it being decent is now debunked because it won't stay on. Turtle Beach screwed up, anyone who tried this for an hour on a handful of games could have quickly spotted this before releasing the product. The device is properly setup, i am 100% sure it is not an error on my end.

The setlist is incredibly weak, and 40 weak songs is definitely not worth my $50. The only redeeming factor is having a Jimi Hendrix song, which they cleverly included to get people to buy it.

I think this is clearly shown in the contents of this game, most of which consists of shameless self-worship by Ferrari, but little else.  Certainly not a playable or enjoyable game.

I'm a huge fan of Ferrari:  the kind of irrational, annoying fan you don't want to get into a conversation with.  (E.g., I've been to the Ferrari factory in Maranello.)

But this game caused a lot of confusion for me:  how did it pass Ferrari's quality inspection?

If you drive around Italy, you won't see a bunch of Ferrari stuff all over the place:  stickers, magnets, t-shirts.  Oh, no.  That stuff's carefully controlled by Ferrari:  they're very jealous of their brand image.  Sure, you can pick up a bunch of Ferrari kitsch, but only at authorized retail outlets, such as the Ferrari gift shop in the Venice airport.

And while the junk you can buy at such pre-approved venues (e.g., pens, mousepads, keychains, etc.) is of little interest to me, you've got to admit, it's high-quality stuff.  Ferrari doesn't want its carefully nurtured brand name tarnished by a bunch of cheap junk.

But, having said that, how could they have authorized this game to be released!?  It's pure crud!  Man.  Thank God for places that let you rent video games before you buy them (wish I had availed myself of one).

Get a whiff of the several problems with this one:

1.  Steering feels all wrong.  I happen to own a Ferrari and it handles much better than the cars in this video game.  True, mine is one of the Kyosho Ferraris, but still.  The action of the car seems to come entirely from the nose, as if you don't have any back wheels at all.

2.  Did you ever dream of being able to drive a Ferrari?  Would be nice, wouldn't it?  But you have to admit that it'd be kinda dumb if everybody else in the world had Ferraris too.  That's exactly what happens in this video game.  Everybody has Ferraris.  It's not like some of the drivers have Porsches and Lamborghinis, no.  You're just gonna be staring at Ferraris until even the most ardent fan is sick of them.

3.  A related problem:  since every other driver has a car just like yours (or better), and since they never make mistakes (e.g., taking corners too wide), there's no way for you to win races.  This game is far too difficult.

4.  You can't crash your car!  I find this more than a little absurd.  You can hit a solid wall at a jillion miles an hour and your car won't accordion, or even flip.  Rather, it'll look like it's just been waxed.  I guess Ferrari didn't want people with visual memories of scratched-up Ferraris?

5.  This game should have been called ""Pininfarina,"" since Pininfarina designs the bodies of Ferrari, whereas the Ferrari company only designs the engine and the chassis.  I say this because pretty much the only virtue of this game is staring at the back ends of those beautiful cars.  But Ferrari didn't even make those!

6.  But even that isn't so great in context, since the game designers didn't seem to put much effort or attention into much else:  graphics, variety, etc.  There are other games (e.g., X-Box's Forza Motorsport 3, or GT5) where you can drive a Ferrari that at least feels convincing in the context of a game that is worthy.  Nothing approaching that experience is to be had here.

7.  Unlikely you'll be able to drive your favorite Ferrari in this game.  Find a list somewhere and you'll see that the Ferraris included in this game are not popular favorites such as anything in the 308 or 328 series, but instead racing workhorses such as the F348 and several clones of it.  When they released this game, the gamemakers reportedly promised there'd be ""50 cars"" available to unlock or download.  Unsurprisingly, given the slip-shoddiness of this game, they haven't even come close to delivering on that promise.  Disloyalty to fans.

1.0,False,"02 23, 2012",AIR57G6ARRC5P,B005EZ5GQO,waterbowl,"I am dumbfounded why so many people give this game glowing reviews. What is wrong with this game? Plenty.

Monsters level with you. Items level with you. Shops level with you. Dungeons level with you. This means, everything in the world depends on what level you are. Where's the feeling of my character being stronger, when I can go back to the easy areas and fight the creatures that once gave me a hard time? Where's the challenge of fighting creatures that are twice my level? A good RPG lets you fight tough battles so you have to think of a tactic to win, with multiple reloads. A good RPG lets you fight weaker battles so you feel more stronger and feel a sense of achievement in your characters development. Where's the feeling of finding a good item in a dungeon? You can't, all the items you find are leveled with you as well.

Combat is a click-fest. This is not a PC RPG. It's a console game that tries to act like a PC game, with console features and console combat. Click the mouse button as fast as you can to win. There is even a glitch that I found, when holding a torch and casting a destruction spell, I can actually cast faster than normal. With a game that won so many awards, bugs are all over the place. You don't have to think or plan to win any of the fights in the game. Can you run around and click the mouse button? Congrats, you just won. I prefer some thinking involved that you find in a PC RPG.

Lackluster NPC's. They all sound the same with the same voice actors. What a bore. How can a game get so many rewards when they stick every person in the world with the same voice actor. It gets annoying when everyone you talk to sounds the exact same. There are beggars in the game, they are used for several quests. When you talk to them, they try to sound ""poor"", and are quite annoying. But that's not all the beggars do that's annoying. When you talk to them, they will try to convince you that they're ""poor"" with their voices, but when you ask them a question about something else, their voices change to match everyone else in the world! This game is ridiculous when it comes to the voice acting. Not only do all the NPC's sound the same, they actually change their voices during conversations.

Arrows tell you where to go. If you get a quest, you get an arrow on your map that shows the exact location where you have to go. In a PC RPG, you have to figure out where to go, you have to stop and think of how to solve a quest. Because this is a console game, you get arrows pointing all over the place showing you how to solve every single quest in the game. You don't even have to listen to any of the NPC's, not a single word. Ignore them and skip all their dialogue, follow the arrows and you solve your quest without knowing what's going on. In a PC RPG, you have to take notes and think how to solve a problem. Having arrows point to exactly where I have to go makes doing quests pointless, and you could even say the game plays itself without me. What fun.

Maps are pathetic. You can't even type in notes on your map. Ultima Underworld got the auto-map done right, you could type in notes and everything was perfect. How can a game that comes out 14 years later not even include the basics of what a PC RPG has to offer?

A.I. is dumb. There's no other word to describe it. Sometimes you get A.I. companions, they run in to fight without any tactic or thought to their well being.

The interface is clumbsy. You don't even get a spellbook. All the spells you learn get thrown into your inventory like items do. It's not even organized properly. If you're a magic user, you want every spell you can get a hold of. It's not fun when you have hundreds of spells in your inventory, and you have to cycle through them all everytime you want to find ones you want to use. I'm a spellcaster, I want to cast lots of spells, what's wrong with wanting a spellbook like a normal mage. If you get a lot of items, you'll have to do a lot of scrolling up and down just to find what you're looking for. How hard is it to get inventory management done right in today's age? Even budget games can do it right. There isn't even a key ring. Key rings have gone back for years in PC RPG's. It helps you keep all your keys in one place, so they don't clutter your inventory space. Well, no key ring in this game. If you get lots of keys, prepare to do lots of scrolling.

You can be good at everything. What makes a good PC RPG? Diversity, challenge. When you're good at everything, you can't overcome your weakness. You can't use your strengths. You become the best at every skill, you can join every single guild with one character. You can do *everything* there is with one character. Not only does this kill any replayability in the game, since there are no classes, no diversity in any type of character development, it also kills any fun in creating a unique character.

Leveling up is too easy and simplified. Instead of gaining levels through defeating creatures and solving quests, you gain levels by doing the same thing over and over again. You can become a high level without ever leaving town, cast the same spells over and over again, and before you know it, you're level 30. Leveling goes up fast regardless of your character level, so it only takes slightly longer to reach the max of each skill the higher you go, but it's still fast. Go from 30 conjuration to 100 conjuration in less than a few minutes. Summon a skeleton in a tight corner and cast the undead spell on him over and over again. I much prefer using a PC RPG's way of leveling, this console way is too easy and boring. I even heard about people using a rubber band on the mouse so they can do something similiar while they are at work or school, just to level a skill up high while they are away. How lame that is, have games really sunken this low? PC RPG's do it so much better.

There are 2 good things about this game, it lets you create your own spells and enchantments, and it's an open world. Creating your own spells is fun and done well, but you can't make any complicated spells. PC RPG's have been open world going back 30 years, so this game does nothing new in this regard, it's just nice to see. You can explore lots of places, anywhere you want to right from the start. But know what? Every dungeon looks the same. All the forts, caves, ruins, all have the same look. All ruins look alike, all forts look alike. You go inside one cave, you've been in all the caves. They even have several copy and paste rooms, with several rooms being the exact same in different areas. There are unique rooms here and there, yes, but what's the point when they still look the same and have copied areas? It's the same as it was in Daggerfall, only here it's not ""random"".

This game doesn't deserve all the awards it got. It is a console game, not resembling a PC RPG at all. It's bland, boring, and requires no thinking on part of the player.

1.0,False,"06 5, 2013",A1KGQ2E9VNWVJO,B00027CXEM,Tstops,"Knights of the old republic 1 was one of the greatest games and stories every in videogames.  That's just my opinion but any rpg fan,  Star Wars geek or just any gamer that enjoys a deep story will agree. I think I've beaten the first game six or seven times. I was really excited for knights of the old republic 2 Sith Lords. I remember  the day I got it. I installed that bad boy and with wide eyes and a smile I created my future Jedi guardian. My wide eyes and smile turned into shooting daggers and grinding teeth and me saying ""wait....what"", ""huh, who this guy talking about"", ""wait, why am I here?"", ""what was the point of that"", ""this can't be the only dialog choices they give me"", ""that cut scene makes no sense"", ""what kind of garbage ending was that?"" , I've beaten kotor 2 three times now, and it's obvious this game is completely and painfully unfinished.
  So lets talk about this poop shoot game first. It's 100% playable and combat is an exact clone of the original. So if your a fan of combat from the first game you'll be happy but like a double edge sword this is a freakin sequel, it should be enhanced but they didn't change anything at all and I mean anything,including skills.
  The main problem with this game is the most important thing with a game like this, the story.
Now first let me explain something. Bioware is the company that made the first knights of the republic. Bioware is also responsible for making other great games like baulders gate 1&2, neverwinter nights 1, jade empire, and most notably the mass effect saga. Now, after bioware made kotor 1 they immediately began work on jade empire for Xbox. Lucustarts wanted them to make the sequel to kotor, unfortunately their developers were tied up with jade empire. So lucustarts turned to obsidian, a well known company that made such hits as icewind dale, neverwinter nights 2 and fallout new Vegas. Sounds confusing doesn't it. Obsidian is well known for picking up sequels that bioware and Bethesda don't have time for. But they're still a great company. Unfortunately when they took on a sequel for knights of the old republic it's obvious that they struggled with it and lucustarts really rushed them on the project. I think....no...I know that obsidian couldn't have done better than bioware. The story was to much for them to take on. Unless they could've gotten into the minds of bioware and gotten more time to work on the project I think fans like me would've been much more satisfied.
  Just like in kotor 1 you wake up on a a ship with no memory and you have to relearn your powers....gee...off the bat this game sucks. Are you serious ?! The further you get in this game feels like a cheap rip off of the first. Except your an exiled Jedi they call ""the exile"".....wow the cheese is strong in this one. You have to go around the galaxy looking for the rest of the Jedi which are almost driven to extinction by the Sith. Hmmm that's funny,  in the first game I destroyed the Sith armada. It doesn't matter. Kotor 2 didn't follow the plot to first (which it should've) but it does desperately try to name drop from it. Kotor fails to follow its own plot. Each story quest is a struggle to get momentum going and the events that happen within move the arc of the plot further away. The boring characters who join you all have lack luster and generic personas. You won't want to befriend any of them or romance them. Each character in the first game all had a story to tell and a quest to boot. In kotor 2 the characters leave you scratching your head and going ""mmmmkkkk, I guess since I have no more dialog options ill go see what the droids are up too"". It's really frustrating when this happens. Once I noticed I was headed towards the endgame, I knew it was almost over. I had more questions than answers and strange cut scenes started playing. A boss fight later and credits rolled. My jaw dropped and curses flared out. I immediately started another game....same thing....third game...same. This games plot is just a wreck.
  Some people agree with me and some people say I'm to hard on it.  We should be hard on sequels to great games. It's one thing if the sequel isn't ""as good as the first"" but it's an insult to just give up and send an unfinished product to the consumer. Obsidian pulled a fast one on us. Many well known magazines praised this game as ""good"". How this happens? I don't know but I do know that knights of the old republic 2 Sith Lords is an unfinished game. And unfinished games do not deserve praise no matter what the title of the game is. If you never played knights of the old republic 1, you can get it on steam for cheap and even on iPad. If you want to play the sequel, find a box, write "" this has lightsabers"" on it, dump in used kitty litter with a glow stick and that's about as good as knights of the old republic 2 Sith Lords is.",Well....it has lightsabers.,1370390400,,,

One of the ear cups on my XP500 Turtle Beaches broke off and it was done for. That model was great, and I never ran into any problems with it. While going to buy another pair, I noticed that there was anew model (XP SEVEN) and decided to buy it. This product DOES NOT WORK straight out of the box and is not an easy set up. Turtle Beach DOES NOT mention in the instructions that all the speakers in the headset are turned down. What you have to do, is manually turn up all 4 speakers on the mix-amp provided. After that, you turn up the master volume.

Now, this doesn't sound that big of a problem right? Well, on my pair IT WAS STILL TOO QUIET. The audio also cuts/drops out when there is faint sounds (This was the only thing I fixed on the headset. Reviewer one had great info on this, but it didn't help fix the product). Extremely frustrated, I did more research. I eventually got to the point of having to download WinRar, going to Turtle Beach's website, downloading the Advanced Sound Editor, opening it with WinRar (Because it's the only way to open it), Installing it, and tried to increase the volume. The Sound Editor improved the sound a little bit, but the sound quality sounded muffled.

I don't know about you, but when i pay almost $300 for a product, I expect it to work once you follow the instructions for setting it up. Not having to do research and downloading programs trying to make it work properly.

1.0,False,"08 1, 2011",ANNLCGS4PI9WX,B00006F7S8,John L. Guest,"This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its ""owners"" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a ""cash cow"" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or ""crash to desktop"" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain ""habits"" in the play methodology. If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.

The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed ""Simcity 4 Deluxe"" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive now&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SimCity-4-Rush-Hour-Expansion-Pack/dp/B00009V3NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack</a>.

This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the ""networks"" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of ""transportation"" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.

There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game ""stubs"" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so ""support sites"" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.

The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a ""strategy"" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't ""an answer"" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single ""regional development"" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.

The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running ""game support"" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.

In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0000C0YW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;or the downloadable version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition-Download/dp/B00457VJ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download</a>] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-SimCity-Box/dp/B0014468XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The SimCity Box</a>&nbsp;I have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it. The downloadable versions should be ""pre-patched"".

Be VERY CAUTIOUS buying a used version from eBay, etc as you MUST have the registration membership in the EA/Maxis web site to update the game with it's patches.. only buy if you can get this membership with its User Name and Password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered... many people have been burned on this matter Even buying ""new"" versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report ""already in use"" even though you ""bought it"" as ""new"". Get the seller to guarantee the version is register-able

2)""Adjustments"" made to the game to ""balance"" it help ""wallet warriors"" even more - you have money for gold ammo (yes in addition to premium acount which is $15/month and premiums tanks that go for up to $80 you can buy gold ammo for EVERY battle)- you win !!!
3)They talked a lot about making the graphics look better - well they do a little bit - still game looks like it has about 8 years not 2.

When I first started playing my Collectors Edition TPP, I was having lots of fun. Four star worthy at best, because while it was fun, the storytelling was a lot less solid than any previous Metal Gear, and the gameplay was so different that it felt alien to MGS.
About 60 hours in is when I started to really dislike this game. The graphics were all well and good, and while the game was getting pretty redundant for all the features it contained, plot flaws kept popping up like breeding rabbits. The continuity line of Metal Gear Solid started to break.
81 hours in, I finished a special mission with Quiet, and that mission bred more plot flaws. The game became a real grind to achieve the ""True"" ending.
91 hours in, finally achieve the true ending. And let me just say, as a huge fan of this series, with every MG and MGS game owned as well as patches, shirts, and a little Solid Snake Clayboy, it was a real kick in the pants. I am certaintly not the only fan of this series who was hurt by this ending. Kojima retconned the entire series, and the only untainted characters are Solid Snake and Otacon. I felt very downtrodden, and tempted to throw my stupid Collectors Edition cardboard ""leather"" box out into the night.

1.0,False,"04 18, 2010",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B000ZK9QCS,Caraculiambro,"Seems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me. It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, ""How is it played?"" and I respond, ""Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!"" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.

Anyhow, here's some other things:

1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?

2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.

3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.

4. The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.

5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.

7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!

9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., ""Bow of Apollo,"" ""Claws of Hades""), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies.

10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!

11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a ""BLOOD OFF"" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?

The game lacks any depth whatsoever. It's NOT a strategy game, but more like a lame hybrid between diablo 3 and overlord

General concept:
-You start off with a dungeon heart and few imps (similar to DK3) and your main character that you can control (THE ONLY thing you can control). The character runs around placing pentagon's that summon various monsters and increase your area of influence. There is no need to strategically dig around to create cool looking rooms as you won't need them.
-Objective of the game is to lure the heroes in, let them wander around for a bit and then prevent them from leaving with your money. Most of the time you will end up doing that with your character as you can't control other monsters and even if they end up fighting the heroes they are really too weak to do anything about it.

This game to me personally is only worth $20; The gameplay is laughably pathetic and the storyline is not too creative. Sure the idea to put you behind the scenes of Raccoon City was perfect but the execution was done poorly. The guns on this game provide little to no value within itself, when you saved up for that sweet desert eagle you expect fire power but instead you have little ammo for the gun and barely do much damage to any special infected. No it cant even give you that satisfaction. The combat system is very rough, it takes multiple rounds to kill the notorious Hunters of the RE series which in fact gets tedious when you're given 6+ of them to take down. The boss battles are uninspiring, they provide no entertainment when your just pumping a tyrant full of lead with no particular strategy in mind. And knifing on this game is not worth mentioning. This game fails to relive any recent Resident Evil title.

The only good things about the game is the idea of playing a special squad set to destroy evidence of the Umbrella Project and to experience the chaos of the original outbreak. The cons of the game brings me back to the inventory system, there is NO SYSTEM. You only have your primary weapon and your secondary handgun. Your offhand items include 1 first aid spray and a couple of grenades. To new resident evil players this game is too easy to pick up but to true veterans its just a spin off thats making a profit just off the name of a beautiful franchise.

It seems that Microsoft has chosen to add a copy-protect program-- ""SafeDisc""-- to render the CD-ROM incompatible with every single drive I have. A readme file included with Mech Commander warns the user of this problem, when it is too late.
Unfortunately, Microsoft neither includes a warning on the box, nor posts a list of incompatible drives on the Web-- as of this writing. Those who have not yet purchased Mech Commander 2 should be aware that, among many other drives, the CD-ROM fails with the following: Sony CDU5211, Sony CDU77E, Acer CD-624a, Memorex CD-RW2224, Plextor CD-ROM PX-32TS (SCSI), Sanyo CRD-256P, and the Yamaha 2216E, 4416SX, and CDR6416S-VK. The full list is probably much longer. Microsoft does indicate that the Sony CDU77E should work if it is configured as a master drive, but all of the others listed are right out.
I am personally going to contact Mircosoft about getting a replacement disc. I suspect a patch will not arrive, since this is a hardware issue, and Microsoft obviously will not do anything to override a system they just spent money to install and distribute.

 I wasn't expecting Mario to be jumping out of the screen at me, but this game really doesn't look any better than Double Dash. I'm using a hd tv with component cables. The game could have been a bit more polished.

Game Play:

cheapness factor-
 The computer LOVES to time its Lighting, Spike Shell or POW to make sure you fall off a ledge or make it possible for you to lose your first place slot.

 Whats up with the rare weapons like Lighting and Spike Shell coming up multiple times in a race? In former games those were few and far between. Three lightnings in one race? WTH nintendo?

 I don't want to lose a race when I have done nothing wrong. That just seems to happen a lot in this game though. Multiple spike shells FTL!

 My brother and I enjoyed this feature in past games. This is huge step back for the series.

However, now that a few more people have weighed in, I've decided to write a more comprehensive review of the product.
Checkered Flag is a follow up to the popular Atari Lynx game by the same title.  Whereas the Lynx game used mode 7 graphics, the ""64 bit"" (cough, cough) power of the jag allowed for a full polygonal engine.  This was an important release for Atari, as it was one of the few Jaguar games with any name value at all.
What was released to the public still stands as one of the worst racing games of all time.  Virtua Racing on the 32x, or even the genesis, looks and plays better than Checkered Flag, and there is simply no excuse for that.
Like many Jaguar games, Checkered Flag lacks any form of texture mapping.  The polygon counts are insanely low, many objects in the environment are nigh indistinguishable.  The framerate is absolutely criminal, the game often dips to what seems to be below 10 fps, and never feels above 15.  This makes the ultra-sensitive, untuned controls even worse.  Navigating tight corners is almost entirely guesswork, as the game often seems to give you five frames or less to see where you are as you peel through the turn.  It's possible to get somewhat of a feel for it, but if you can get through a single lap of any course without crashing at least once, then you are certainly a better man than I.
The developers seemed adamant about having the cars go 189 to 200 miles per hour, the poor framerate isn't traditional ""slowdown"", the cars maintain their rapid clip as the frames jerk quickly to catch up, often leaving the driver completely disoriented. The game is close to unplayable.
To make the game extra sadistic, the tournament mode requires you to do ten to fifteen laps per course.  Finishing takes over an hour of painful tedium.

In addition, this new ""slam"" mechanic is awful. It's mapped to triangle, the same button as grind, so you can only guess how that feels when you're trying to hit a rail and instead you press it a second too soon or something and just slam to the ground instead.

The one positive? The physics actually feel good this time. Gone are the crap physics from THPS HD. So that begs the question, why would they improve the physics to feel more like the originals, therefore pretty much nailing the gameplay of the old games, only to completely ruin the flow of the gameplay with the slam move? It boggles the mind.

Also, the soundtrack sucks. Absolute, unadulterated trash from what I've heard.

As much as we've seen made of the glitches on the internet, I haven't experienced those. I experienced some goofy ragdolls, though. That said, what ruins this game is not the glitches, nor the physics that tarnished THPS HD, but it's things that could and should have been avoided but weren't.

Pros:
Physics feel correct, therefore the gameplay isn't as off as in THPS HD
While real bad, it's still better than those crap peripheral games like Ride and Shred

Cons:
Level design is absolute trash
Slam mechanic ruins the flow of the otherwise decent gameplay
Framerate is all over the place
Graphics, as we expected, are low-end PS3/Xbox 360
Soundtrack isn't memorable like the earlier games and is full of stinkers

Guys, this one's bad -- like real bad! I could forgive the crappy slam mechanic, a bad soundtrack, and some performance hitches and mediocre graphics, but when the level design is so amateur and slipshod, why even bother playing it? These levels feel like they were made in the level creator without any care or thought put into them at all. The level design alone is enough to earn this game a 1/5.

I'm not a super harsh person, and I often enjoy lower budget games, so I was willing to give this game the benefit of the doubt and thought that perhaps it'd have some redeeming qualities even if it had a lot of flaws, but the level design alone completely makes this game a waste of your time and my time.

Well, below is the review I wrote after a couple of hours of gameplay. As someone else said, it starts out slow and then the story develops. Later in the game you get couple of new guns and new ""FREAKS"" show up!
-It seems someone did not pay a lot of attention to detail for the weapons. If there are 3 rounds left and i push in 5 more rounds to make total of 8 rounds..you don't need to pump the shotgun..a round is already in the muzzle. You pump the shotgun if you completely run out of rounds and feed fresh 8 rounds, now you need to pump one into the chamber before you can fire.
Apparently...this is something simple and should be expected of all FPS by now. ITs little things and attention to detail that make all the difference between a 3 Star and 5 Start FPS

Most importantly,
This game is the most ""SCARY"" game ever. (period)

-----------------------
-----------------------
Overall, this game is weak!
The only good things about this game are the Graphics.
The Game play is bad, same old going through levels and shooting bad guys. Same old guns that make sad sounds. You are playing the whole game is darkness...but if you need a Flash light you need to switch to Flashlight and then switch back to the weapon you were using. ""what the heck, can I not have my flash light taped to my gun"".
and them, you are at a Top notch research facility (Weapons research and what not ) but there are is no Night Vision goggle's. You fire the same old guns...that ofcourse look different but are no better.
Let me put it this way:
Half-Life was better than this game (except the Graphics)
and lets not even start comparing it with HALO, cause this game is not even close to HALO.
oh and did I mention, this game has to RE-PLAY value to it.
Do NOT buy this game, you'll just end up wasting your money. Wait for Half-Life2 and HALO2 to come out, I can bet they will be better than this piece of junk.",Weak - updated to (OK STATUS),1091836800,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

as far as the graphics, they're very nice.  however, the text on the screen is very small.  this might not be a problem if you have a newer TV with good clarity.  mine is older and i had to get close to the TV to read the text.  which brings me to the next issue with dead rising...  it has a bunch of stories and quests and stuff.  to me, this doesn't make much sense.  if i wanted stories and quests, i could have played Oblivion.  it's obvious they should have done quests in a simplified manner, by pointing out where to go on the map with an arrow and having you fight through zombies to get there.  that would have provided simple honest fun.  instead, they give you like a quest journal and a freakin' map!!  i don't want to press an extra button to follow a map around in a game like this.  they should leave the maps to silent hill or world of warcraft.

another thing - they have voice acting in the cutscenes, and then when you start playing, the characters only talk in text.  HUH?!  this is 2007, this is the powerful 360, and you're telling me we're still using TEXT instead of VOICE?!  it screams ""this was a rushed game.""

there are too many complications to getting into the zombie-killing fun.  if they had simplified this game and improved the controls, i would have liked it.  but i got bored before 30 minutes of gameplay.

oh yeah, how could i forget the save system!!!  as you can see, everyone hates the save system, and for good reason.  i'm not the kind of person who has to save whenever i want, but in place of that i at least want a good checkpoint auto-saving feature.  instead, when you die here, you have to go way back before the part you were playing, to the dialogue etc. before it.  that is really annoying to me.  every other game out there has a good checkpoint auto-save system but this one.  again, it screams ""this game was rushed.""","killing zombies with a bunch of stuff.. how could you screw that up, right?",1172966400,12,,

I liked it at first, though I kept getting the same four maps and would sometimes be sent back to the dashboard for seemingly no reason.

This happened in early December and since then I have been completely unable to get a match. I have tried a multitude of methods, I have all the patches, my internet connection is fine, the game just DOES NOT WORK. It's that simple.

I regret having spent this much money on a game that I haven't been able to play for nearly two months.

Not all remotes have that rubber coating, but the ones that do, they are more expensive.  So if you gonna use this charging station, buy remotes without the rubber protective overlay.

It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.

As of 12/1/14:

* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.

* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.

* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.

* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.

* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.

* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.

* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.

I'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up. If they fix the problems and the price goes down to $30ish, you should buy this game.

(This is going to be a rather long review, so I'll put a TL;DR verson at the base of it)

Single Player

The reason I was so psyched for Homefront was because of the premise of the Single Player campaign. The premise sounded incredible: 15 years in the future, Korea has unified, causing problems for the US. The US is abandoned by its cowardly allies and is eventually hit by a massive EMP and invaded and controlled by Korea. You are a pilot named Robert Jacobs fighting in the Resistance trying to make headway against the Koreans.

Sounds like a unique, slam-dunk plot, right? WRONG.

To start with, the single player is ridiculously short. If anybody tells you it is a 5 to 10 hour campaign, they are SORELY mistaken. The single player campaign contains 7 levels, each lasting a half hour at most. 3 hours later, just as you get into the game, it's over, just like that.

Now, a short game is fine if the story works... but it doesn't. As you play, you meet 4 other main characters, but you learn virtually nothing about any of the characters, yourself included. There is no clear motivation behind anybody in the game. This results in you realizing that you really don't care about any the plot in general. Then comes the factor that the plot line itself seems to jump around between levels with little explaination, and then abruptly ends with no resolution.

Controlls are similar to CoD in that the same buttons are used to reload, switch weapons, crouch, etc. However, the controlls  are much more sluggish than in CoD, which will quickly drive you nutty. And your AI teammates are just as slow as you are, which gets frustrating as you get stuck spending 5 minutes waiting for him or her to open a door or go up a ladder in front of you so you can continue on with your mission.

Graphics are strikingly low-quality. I saw comparable graphics last gen on my Gamecube. Now, I usually don't care about poor graphics if the gameplay and story are fun, but if they aren't, lousy graphics prove to be just another nail in the coffin.

Also, a side note: when you load up a new campaign in a shooter, you expect to be able to choose your campaign difficulty, especially when the game has multiple achievements related to completing levels on ""Guerilla"" difficulty. Halo does this, as does Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead, Gears of War, 007, and just about every other shooter I've ever played. Homefront, however, doesn't tell you what difficulty you're playing (normal by default). Instead, you have to actually seek out the difficulty settings below 3 levels of menus from the main menu. I didn't find this until I beat the game, and at that point I had absolutely no desire whatsoever to load up the game again.

Overall, the single player was probably the biggest letdown I have experienced in a very, VERY long time.

Multiplayer

After my very brief experience in single player, I continued on to multiplayer, hoping for a better experience. Needless to say, I was shocked by what I found.

Let me start off by saying I played a very small amount of the multiplayer. Some of the systems of the multiplayer did intrigue me, and I considered playing more, but I didn't. And here's why...

As it turns out, in an attempt to curb reselling of their crappy game, the developers included a single-use code for multiplayer access in the game. This means that, if you get the game used, borrow it from a friend, or rent it, you're screwed. You are allowed to play enough to get your character to level 5. You then have to BUY access for your profile to the game for 800 points. They are actually forcing you to buy access to content that 1) comes standard in most games, and 2) is something that we already pay for as Xbox LIVE Gold members. Also, over 300 of the retail 1000 gamerscore is multiplayer related, yet many people who pick up and play this game will immedialtey find that they can't get any of these achievements. You're essentially being forced to pay for a DLC pack just to be able to get the retail 1000 points.

TL;DR Version:

I can honestly say that, before Homefront, I had never played a game where it seems like the developers are actively saying ""SCREW YOU"" to the consumer, but Homefront said that and oh, so much more. The campaign does not deliver the gripping story promised but rather leaves you feeling bored and restless, and the multiplayer system gives the finger to anybody who borrows or rents the game.

There's no option you can see to exit the main menu (you have to use the X-Box B key, mapped to right mouse button, just like the zoom and robot firing functions are)? There are separate screens for Options and PC Options? The speeder doesn't work on the PC because they only mapped the reverse key, not the one to go forward?

I have two computers that are far above the minimum requirements for the game but I could not make the game work in one of them no matter how hard I tried. From my research online I guess this is a major issue with many people. I even had trouble with the installation itself (the now famous redundancy error).  I cannot accept that they released a game that doesn't even install correctly.

Second the game itself.  It is an incredible step backwards from Sims 2.  We lose the load screens which indeed sucked, but we lose SO much more. The Sims very animation is poor, they always look a bit fat and their heads are too big (actually their faces are too big, their heads are ok). Those faces on the cover were generated on Photoshop, and no way they were a result from the game.

The jobs and needs were actually improved, but they are implemented on a game that lacks all that which made the previous ones great. The Sims seem more stupid and reluctant to follow directions. The number of objects is really small and the expressions and body language are the same from Sims 2 but the difference in color and animation only serves to remind you of what you aren't playing.  The greater loses are with the female Sims they never look feminine at all. It is very strange.
That and some crashes made me place the game back on the shelf.  In a couple of months I'm sure there will be a patch (or more...) that will reduce the crashes and the number of objects will larger with downloads.

The mouse also feels pretty darn good in my hand.  Comfortable and ergonomic enough. After getting through a bit of the Chinglish (poorly written English, from China) I got the mouse installed and working.  This is where things start to get bad.

The smooth plastic footing was stuck on crooked and was peeling up in two places.  Not a huge deal as they provide a replacement with the mouse.  The tuning weights were also not included with my mouse.  There is a black container but not metal weights in it or the mouse.  :(

The most important thing for a gaming mouse (imho) is the ability to track well as well as programmable buttons for MMO.  The list of features, and price, look good but the tracking is pretty bad.  I am using an expensive gaming mouse pad and thought this might be the problem.  I tried it on a wooden desk and also with a plain black mouse pad.  Long story short there is significant lag and jittery movement.  I restarted my gaming rig, I tried re-installing the software, etc... It would work well for 20-60 seconds and then the cursor would hop around.  I have a hard time believing this is true 16,400 DPI.  I have no way of figuring this out.  If it is a true 16,400 DPI mouse it must be using an inexpensive sensor.

1.0,True,"01 22, 2014",AD8M3PE8J2G86,B005QWYKOE,S D,"The worst Nintendo console I've ever owned and I immediately sold it after a few months before anyone else found out what I found out about it and before it got any cheaper than it already was. The worst thing was that I got a KU version of the Wii which wasn't backwards compatible with Nintendo GameCube games, controllers, or memory cards. I was so looking forward to it, judging by all the hype and positive things I heard, all the lies, I thought that I was going to finally enjoy a great gaming experience with fluent motion controls, but I was dead wrong. The Nintendo Wii is an underpowered, inferior console with graphics on par with it's predecessor the Nintendo GameCube. Even with the component cable bringing it up to 480P it still looked like a generation before its time. This thing couldn't even compete with the PS2 or Xbox let alone the PS3 and Xbox 360. When it came to graphics, gameplay, or anything else, the Wii was way behind.

The gimmicky, HORRIBLE, ATROCIOUS, controls of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk are so awful that they've ruined games which had so much potential to become classic Nintendo titles. The thing that bothers me the most about the Wii is the few options available for controls. You HAVE to use the Wii Mote and Nunchuk for most games. The Classic Controller isn't utilized for any of its ""good"" games and is mostly used with the virtual console games, not that the Classic Controller didn't suck as well because it did and the GameCube controller was far superior and felt far more comfortable in my hands. The Wii classic controller is really small, has awkward placement of its buttons, is extremely light and feels like it was made from very cheap plastic with no rumble feature, the trigger buttons are awkward, the joysticks are weak and can easily break, and the DPad is stiff and gets stuck during gameplay. The Wii Classic Controller is complete garbage compared to the amazing Nintendo GameCube controller that came out years and years before it.

If you have played The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess on the GameCube, than do not buy a Nintendo Wii and play the Wii version of that game. The Wii controls for Twilight Princess absolutely destroyed a somewhat decent Zelda title. In the Wii version of Twilight Princess you have to keep a floating fairy that corresponds to the position of the Wii Mote with the TV and Sensor Bar, dead center in the middle of the screen or else Link will walk off in another direction and you'll constantly fall off annoying ledges and it will slow you down and reduce the quality of your game play significantly. It'll also make your wrist tired from having to keep it constantly aimed at the center of the screen. I AM APPALLED BY THE AUDACITY, OF THOSE ADVERTISERS ON GAME TRAILERS AND IGN, WHO LIED OUT OF THEIR TEETH ABOUT THE NINTENDO Wii. They made the Wii appear to be something that it was the complete opposite of. They advertised Twilight Princess and made statements about how wonderful the Wii Mote controls are and how good it feels to swing a sword around. LIES! You don't swing a sword around in Twilight Princess, you flick your wrist around and Link moves the sword in correspondence to a predetermined set of directions. The sword doesn't move in the direction you aim it in, it goes in the directions the game aims it in, which is the same exact predetermined set of directions. Using the shield is also annoying because you have to punch with the Nunchuk and it doesn't always work unlike the GameCube version where you press the R button to hit with the shield. Fishing becomes much more needlessly challenging and horseback riding is much worse all because of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. Fishing doesn't feel like fishing at all, despite the lies of the advertisers on IGN and Game Trailers. All you're doing is reeling in the lure by rotating the Nunchuk in a circular motion with the annoying cord of the Nunchuk, I preferred the control stick and A button from the GameCube version. Horse back riding was also destroyed by the Wii Mote and Nunchuk since you have to keep the on screen fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else the horse will move in another direction slowing you down and running you into obstacles and cliffs. Same thing when controlling the wolf.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl is another major disappointment and without a doubt the worst addition to what was a decent fighting game series. Brawl is awful, especially when compared to the original Smash Bros. for the N64; and when compared to Smash Bros. Melee for the GameCube, Brawl is complete garbage. I recently got Brawl and was playing it on my recently purchased Wii U (which is another garbage console but I'm not here to review the Wii U). I had to pay $20 for a Mayflash Nintendo GameCube to Wii U controller adapter (which is another piece of garbage as well) just to play Brawl with ""decent"" controls because I was playing it with the Wii Mote earlier before this adapter arrived. It's so unbelievably boring and I completely refuse to play through the subspace emissary, all you do is side scroll fighting weird creepy enemies that look like dolls stitched together from old throw pillows (Primid). The adventure mode in melee was much better and much cooler. There's new characters in the game that are completely obscure and uninspired. All the problems that existed in Melee are back tenfold in this game like the clone characters (Ganondorf, Captain Falcon, Fox, Falco, Wolf, etc). Melee's Link was much cooler since his design was based on the Ocarina of Time Link, Brawl's Link is based on the very effeminate and wimpy looking Twilight Princess Link. The graphics hurt my eyes and I'm playing on a Plasma Screen 40 inch Samsung with the Wii U HDMI cable. The way Brawl plays just feels sluggish and slow. It feels like the frame rate has been downgraded immensely and slowed down from Melee. There's no fun factor in Brawl, I've technically only played it for 1 day and I'm ready to sell my Wii U and everything that came with it. I thought for sure this would be the one decent playable Wii game, but it's just as bad as all the others and I won't sit through this abomination. Brawl is virtually unplayable, especially if you've experienced Melee or the original Smash Bros.; Brawl is a disgrace to the series.

I was lied to about the Nintendo Wii and no one told me how terrible it really was, otherwise I would have never bought it. All the so called ""good"" games on the Wii turned out to be complete failures because of the awful Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. When playing New Super Mario Bros. and Metroid Other M, the control is even worse than in other Wii games. You don't use the Wii Mote and Nunchuk, you use the Wii Mote flipped on it's side. It's like playing with a remote controller, a thin remote control, using no joystick just a dpad. It isn't fun and it's a major step backwards from the GameCube controls. Had they given us the option to use a regular controller like any other video game console uses, those games could have been classics like the Wii version of Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Skyward Sword, Metroid other M, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, New Super Mario Bros., etc. Instead, these games are virtually unplayable and will go down in history as Nintendo's biggest disappointments to their true fan base.

Using the internet browser in the Wii was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. It uses the crappy Opera internet browser and weak Flash Player Light. It was slow, sluggish, and lagged immensely even with a fast internet connection. The YouTube App is the worst version of a YouTube app I've ever seen on any electronic device. When searching for a video, it automatically spells the words for you and more often than not, it's a word you didn't intend to search for. It doesn't show the correct search results anyway; even when you can manage to type in the words using the awful controls of the Wii remote. When typing in the words, you have to aim the Wii Mote at each character, you can't use the Wii classic controller or plug in a keyboard, you can't use the DPad from the Wii Mote or the control stick from the Nunchuk to select the characters. When aiming at the characters the Wii Mote vibrates with each character the pointer runs over. More often than not, you'll accidentally select a character that you didn't want because it's so hard to get the pointer to focus on one single character and you won't be able to simply backspace that single character to make a correction. Selecting backspace deletes the entire word and you have to type it all over again all because of a simple mistake. The search results are never correct, it never returns accurate search results and you can never see official music videos. I think there was some kind of copyright issue where Vevo won't allow their videos to be seen on the Wii. The same thing happens with the P.S Vita (another garbage system) and its YouTube app and internet browser.

Owning the Wii was the biggest disappointment of my life and all because of the lies and the over-hyping of the entire YouTube community. The entire YouTube community is guilty for making this garbage system seem like anything other than a glorified Nintendo GameCube with virtually unplayable controls that destroyed games with the potential of being classic Nintendo titles.",This is without a doubt,1390348800,2,,

I really wanted to like/love FF14, i even bought a 2000$ gaming pc just for this game, i ended up wasting 2000$ :(
I'll try to find good pc games at least i guess since I'm mostly a console gamer, anyway

SE released incomplete game and they know it, there are so many bugs and i expect them to be fixed sooner or later (you can't sell junk to npc lot of times, get reallly annoying when your bag is full, Cure RAISE you from death, cant see party members hp/mp, etc so many bugs)

In this game you will be fighting the user interface mostly not the enemies ! everything is slow and horrible, you will die a lot because of the horrible UI not the enemies and I'm not kidding sadly, so many times it get locked and you can't cure yourself, sometimes the monster attack you and you can not attack him saying ""your target is engaged by you"" yet i can not draw my weapon or attack it.

There is no content whatsoever and the 3 main starter cities combined are smaller than sandoria alone (Sandoria is 1 of the main cities in ff11)

Believe it or not there are ZERO quest in the game, no npc give any quest (no story quests/reward quests to get armor or weapon etc)

The only thing available in the game right now is the guild leve missions and you can only use few every 2 days, there are not a lot of variety in environments, there are 3 cities and 3 BIG field areas mainly (which look really boring after a while, SE decided to use 3 big fields that look exactly the same from start to finish instead of using various fields connected to each other with different music, the bit 3 fields are really huge, as big as a region in ff11 but it look the same in every corner with the same 2min soundtrack getting repeated again and again,

Right now the only ones who are enjoying the game are the ones who enjoy ""leveling up"" so they wear the higher level gear and that's it.

If you want to buy it for storyline don't bother, there are 3 story missions per city and that's it (you can't even watch the story of the other cities because there is no way to switch your main city unlike FF11) pretty much 30min of story content and they will update it over the years i guess just like with FF11.

I really wanted to love the game but atm it's ""leveling only"" i feel like it's a job instead of a ""game""

Leveling take MUCH more time than FF11 that's for sure don't let the general thoughts of leveling in FF14 trick you ! can you solo EXP? YES you can but is leveling faster or on par with FF11? HELL NO, leveling your class is based on skill not exp so you can kill 10 monsters and still won't advance anything at all, it's luck based, sometimes you kill 10 monsters and get 0 skill, and sometimes you kill 3 monsters and get 200 skill points for your weapon, your level depends on your weapon ""skill"" so you can say FF14 leveling system is like ""skill up parties"" in FF11 but worse !

Also crafting is a big part of the game unlike FF11, you have to craft in ff11 or know a friend who can help you with crafting, because armors/weapons/etc BREAK in this game and get damaged SOOOOO FAST, and only crafters can repair them (you can use the repair npc to fix your stuff but he charge WAAAY too much even in early levels, basically you can buy the armor NEW from crafter for the same price as repairing it from an npc)

Also when your weapon get damaged in the field you will have to run back to the city to find a crafter to fix it (which take a lot of time if you don't know a crafter) people even carry multiple weapons/armors now to avoid going back to the city to fix this weapons

As you see too many bad things to say about this game and so little good to say, the only good thing is the graphic in my opinion.

There is no AH house in the game and SE have no plans to add one, they only plan to enhance the bazaar system.
you have to go through so many characters to check what you want to buy (require so many buttons through a laggy UI, you can't just /browse a character. most people don't even check the bazar area anymore because you can basically spend 5 hours checking bazaars and ended up not finding what you were looking for to begin with.

I have decided not to pay for the game once my free first month is over, i will keep looking at the game and will properly return when they actually add content OR anything to do in the game, atm it's a grind fest which does not interest me at all, to me grinding in ff11 was the worst parts but it was worth it because you end up doing a lot of great content that actually require those higher level jobs unlike ff14.

Hopefully SE will fix this game sooner, if you read other reviews here you will see so many issues that i didn't even mention yet every ff14 player suffer from.

I don't know what SE were thinking when they released the game at current state, i will keep the game in my radar for its upcoming updates/expansion but right now the game is not playable for me and whenever they decide to fix it i will definitely play it again because it does have potential.",FF XIV Review from FF11 player,1286150400,15,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

1.  The animated backgrounds.  This is a killer.  Everything on screen is trying to distract you from playing the game.  Just a static image on the sides would have been great.
2.  The spin bug.  You can rotate a piece once it hits the bottom as often as you hit the button.  This means you can just keep spinning a piece around until you need to drop it.  No challenge.
3.  No battery.  A huge part of the game was trying to beat your old scores.  Also this means you can't save settings.
4.  Far too permissive default settings.  You get to see the next 3 pieces, and see an outline where the piece should go.  Want to change the settings?  You can, but you can't save it, so you have to do this *every time* you play the game.
Everything about this game feels wrong.  The floating cube head mascot, the annoying backgrounds, and the lame attempts to change the gameplay.  I still use my copy of Tetris DX instead!  I just wish I could get a copy of Tetris DX in a gameboy advance cartridge, as it sticks out of my gameboy advance sp.

I can certainly hear them, because I've been listening to them for the past few years. I will admit, I was excited to play this game at first, seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008...but honestly, I wish I had never played it at all. Why? Well, stick around, sit back, shut up and read.

STORY: 2/10
Atrocious. Simply atrocious. You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud (default name, seeing as you have the option to name your main character), who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE. Why these groups and names have big, capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me, seeing as they don't stand for anything. Along the way, you'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you'll be doing in the current area you're in, get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters, and finally come to the climax of the game, facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes...but not because it's hard. It's not. I have so many problems with this game's story...okay, I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD. You get a total of 9 characters in your party, and guess what? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever! The only reason they exist is for party-filling, seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to...well, ANYTHING. Two of them you don't even technically have to get in your party to begin with! You can literally beat the entire game--all 13-17 hours of it--with the drooling retards you pick up along the way. The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story, and everywhere you turn, you can see something you can bitch about for hours. Party members included.

GAMEPLAY: 1/10
Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time. There's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game. It's the same boring, lazy turn-based system you're used to, except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable. The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched, and every time you use an attack, skill, or spell, you'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass. Oh, and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia...well, I certainly hope you stocked up on food, drinks, and toilet paper; you'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.

PRESENTATION: 0/10
What are you talking about? This game is CLEARLY not even finished. Do you know how many glitches, bugs, and excruciating errors I found while playing this game? Hundreds. The sickest part? I didn't go out of my way to find them. They came to me. The character models look ridiculous, nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game, the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise's name, and you'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two. Or ten. Not only that, but the game is WAY too easy. I literally played through the entire game--story and all--in less than 20 hours. In that time, I never once died or even lost a member of my party (if you're not counting Aeris, seeing as she dies in a cutscene). And hey, if you're having trouble with something, just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls, gain infinite money and items, level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight, deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit, or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats, items, and equipment you already have. But seriously, who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once? This unfinished, broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.

SOUNDTRACK: 0/10
What soundtrack? It's just a bunch of clicks, screeches, and otherwise infuriating sounds. It's not music. It's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds, or your money back! GUARANTEED!

OVERALL RATING: 1/10
This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did. It's especially lucky that Amazon.com's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars. If it was a standard 1-10 rating, I'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10, seeing as I can't stand this absolute travesty of a video game. It's a downright abomination to the world, and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy, like myself. I'm glad I didn't play this game until years after it came out. If I had played it back then, I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time. You can't rate a game based on how well it sold, and you can't rate a game depending on the graphics. Why? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review. I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon.

By the time I got my seventh gen console, NHL '12 had been released, so I wasn't missing this game.  Yet I was strolling through the video store (yep, still have one out here) where I found NHL 2K10.  I wondered what the PS3 version of the game was like.  I wish I hadn't found out...

The menu is clunky and clumsy feeling.  Instead of scrolling through a list, you have to hold the directional pad towards the option you want to select and then press it.  So instead of pressing up and X to start a franchise mode, you have to hold the L paddle up and then press X (Why, who knows?)  Trying to do basic functions seems maddening.  Before, you could scratch players right in the roster menu, no big deal.  Now?  You have to go into the edit line function under the coaching options to swap the person out with another.  Was there a reason why that function had to change?  Also, there doesn't seem to be anywhere where you can edit your minor league team (you could at least see their lines in the sixth gen console games.)  It's understandable that the licensing was missing for the actual teams (meaning no game play) but it's actually devolved from it's sixth gen counterpart.  They also took away the practice skates that built chemistry and could reduce fatigue if you completed a drill (and if it was there, it was so buried to the point where I couldn't find it.  Whereas before, it was a daily option.

Then there's the gameplay that seems rather jilted in favor of the CPU.  Taking faceoffs is quite a challenge.  You go on the attack?  The CPU skates back to defend faster than you on turbo.  Your CPU-controlled teammates will follow the offensive strategy, but make absolutely no effort to move or cycle if they're completely covered.  Most of your one-timers will go completely wide.  But what about when the CPU attacks?  In that case, your defensemen get sand in their skates and leave the goalie alone on breakaways (which is an automatic goal.)  The CPU goals come from just about anywhere except for the narrowest of angles.  Seriously.  After four games, my team's goalie (Cam Ward - Rank 89) had a 6.35 GAA and a 67.5% save percentage.  There was never any fighting, just roughing penalties for hitting too much.  Also, changing lines used to be faster because you could cycle through, but now you have to select the line with a corresponding button (which sucks when you're trying to attack or defend.)  Also, you essentially have to set line changes to manual to have any control (semi-auto doesn't work for some reason.)

The menu's clumsy and the gameplay is terrible, so I can't recommend anyone get it.  If you're adamant about playing a 2K10 title, go play it on a sixth gen system like Playstation 2.

STORY: WEAK

Who is Ozgar? Who are the Arkonians? Why do they hate each other? Why does Ozgar hate you? Is Ozgar really Darth Vader or does he just act like it?

These questions, alas, shall go unanswered. I don't think I'm willing to buy the second game to see if there're any new revelations.

Graphics: Mediocre

Am I unique in not liking when when the resolution is better during movement cutscenes than when you're standing still? I don't think so. ""Wave that picture around, I need to get a good look at it.""

PUZZLES: What?

Much too simple and uninventive. What is all this stuff and what's it for? If I can figure out a code simply by trying random combinations, it's too simple.

ENDING:

You get one screenshot. It doesn't even move. That's your reward for slogging through this awful game.

Puzzles and environmental obstacles have always been a part of Silent Hill design. These puzzles aren't always good, and it seems that Silent Hill Origins takes all of the most irritating and time consuming elements of the previous games and collects them into one disappointing package.

Actually, this moment sums up Silent Hill Origins to me: There's a key in a bathtub. For whatever reason, the water in the tub is so hot that our character refuses to put his hand in the water to get the key. The only option the game gives you is to pull the stopper and drain all the water knowing that the key will wash down the drain. I have a 3 or 4 foot long 2x4 in my inventory, but I can't use the 2x4 to fish the key out. I have a sledgehammer, but I can't bust the side of the tub and let the water drain out. I can't even stand there and let the water cool on it's own (because apparently this is super demon hell water that never cools down). So, I pull the plug and Travis (our main character) watches the key run down the drain. Travis is carrying all of these weapons, but it doesn't occur to him to use any of them to keep the key from going down the drain. That's really my problem with the game...apparently Travis is a total moron, and the game designers use Travis' idiocy to artifially lengthen the game.

The Review:

-Same old boring gameplay as the original release in 2000
-Same depressing uninspiring game world of Termina
-Same boring nonsensical NPC's
-Same circular boring nonsensical world of Termina with horrid re-worked/re-mixed Zelda overworld music that somehow manages to make the traditional Zelda overworld theme sound awful instead of inspiring as it sounded in LTTP.
-Same lack of a true Zelda game's feel (no Hyrule to explore, no Ganon, no Princess Zelda, no Hylian mythos...what makes this game a ""Zelda"" game again exactly?)
-Though the time system is indeed garbage and universally panned even by Nintendo's most ardent sycophants the game like all Aonuma dreck erroniously labelled Zelda remains so utterly easy in the challenge department even a lobotomy patient could complete it.

Verdict: 1 star because to my knowledge Amazon won't let me rate it any lower, the game is horrible, avoid if intelligent.

Commentary:

Nintendo as always for the last decade plus continues its dissapointing trend of not only keeping the hack no talent ""Jimmy Fallon of Japan"" Eiji Aonuma employed (for some strange reason despite his games not selling) but also re-releasing the same old boring dog vomit they released years ago knowing well enough that their sycophantic gaming audience will be stupid enough to continue to buy their re-packaged turds over and over again because that is what insane people do or rather it is the very definition of insanity to do something over and over again expecting a different result.

Well Majora's Mask was a garbage universally panned/reviled game upon it's original release around the year 2000 and not much has changed as per it's quality with it's re-release now on the 3DS.

The game is still garbage, still not a genuine Legend Of Zelda title (the world and theme are totally wrong and off).

The moon is still goofy as hell, the world is still not scary and the story is still boring all these years later.

Really the only thing that has changed is the online community.

Back in the year 2000 the online gaming community was populated by a ratio of 85% sane people and 15% crazies which are comprised of anime freaks, pedophiles and weirdos.

Since 85% of the people you'd see on the online videogame message boards were of a far saner stock than today you'd mostly end up getting the correct summation of a game's value or lackthereof if you perused said forums before engaging in your videogame shopping activities.

Well anyway upon it's initial release (the year 2000 or thereabouts) the sane 85% of people that existed in the videogame online forum communities of the time utterly rejected Majora's Mask and it bombed in sales figures because Aonuma utterly abandoned Hyrule, it's lore, it's mythos and it's whimsical nature (mixed with just enough darkness to make the land feel tainted by an evil that must be overcome) to Majora's boring trainwreck of a world known as Termina whose world lacked whimsy and genuine darkness and a feeling of real evil to be fought and instead replaced it with a feeling of grinding depression which the 15% of rainbow hair colored ""social justice warriors"" (Orwellian term) a.k.a Communists a.k.a ""Hipsters"", who have become the new 85% majority on the online gaming message forums in the year 2015 to the detriment of ALL, are all too familiar with (in addition to the plethora of other mental illnesses from which they suffer) hence they have relegated this piece of garbage Majora's Mask, this utterly forgetabble turd of a game, to cult status, solely because they identify with it's inferiority and Aonuma's hackish ""try hard"" nature which is reflective of they themselves and their own life struggles to be more than they are which only end in resentment for their betters leading to their terminal victim mentality which made them become self styled ""social justice warriors"" a.k.a neo-Communists to begin with.

They laud Aonuma's polished turd Majora's Mask with undeserved praise even though it will soon be collecting dust on their shelves going unplayed like the rest of the Aonuma dreck that they always momentarily and frothily praise, only to eventually come to grips with reality that Aonuma's games simply are not fun or at all compelling to play.

The so called ""Zelda Cycle"" that they bozos spend so much of their time prattling on about isn't really a ""Zelda"" Cycle at all since Zelda was killed by Aonuma the moment ""Wind Waker"" was unveiled.

Since Majora's Mask was Aonuma's first attempt at destroying the Zelda franchise it is more appropriate to speak of the Aonuma cycle and what does a cycle do? A cycle is something that goes around in a circle, it spins around, thus follow me with this imagery here.

""Zelda"" as a unique and beautiful midieval sword and sorcery epic whose core was it's arcade combat mixed with light RPG elements began circling the drain of the commode the very moment the hack Aonuma was made producer/director over the series beginning with Majora's Trash.

So ""Zelda cycle"" no...

More like ""Aonuma cycle"" and the Aonuma cycle ends in the septic tank where all feces belongs which of course translates to real world terms and those of course are Aonuma's ""Zelda games"" (whatever that means) don't sell anywhere near the degree they'd need to for Nintendo to continue to justify to it's shareholders to keep on making them. The series is in very dire trouble and for whatever insane/cultural/corporate/friendship reason Shigeru Miyamoto/Nintendo simply refuses to pull the plug on Aonuma's involvement with the once great Zelda series which is the only thing at this point that could possible make it rise from the grave and shine brightly again.

Pull the plug on Eiji Aonuma's career Nintendo/Miyamoto.

End Zelda's suffering and ours.

To the gamers that loved LTTP, OOT, Link's Awakening, Zelda II and the original LOZ on the NES and any sane individuals who have come to realize my words are true and that Aonuma is a hack and the grand ruiner of the Zelda series, I beg of you to save your money if you at all care about the Zelda series ever regaining it's quality and mass appeal as it had with Link to the Past and Ocarina Of Time and even the first and second Legend Of Zelda games on the NES.

As long as Aonuma remains employed by Nintendo the Zelda series will remain ruined and games made by other companies that do the job Zelda used to do the best ie open worlds, sword combat, magic combat (which is all summed up as arcade action adventure gameplay mixed with light RPG elements) the new games of the Elder Scrolls series, The Witcher 3, Grand Theft Auto 5 and on will continue to outshine Aonuma's turds erroniously labelled ""Zelda"" and the Zelda series will simply continue to fall into irrelevancy by the gaming community overall.

Help send Nintendo the message to fire Eiji Aonuma by not giving them your money to buy his garbage. Email Nintendo and ask them politely to fire Eiji Aonuma and put a man of actual talent who understands the Zelda series on the project instead and that man's name is Yoshiaki Kozuimi (A writer of many of the pre-Aonuma Zelda game's stories) as well Mr. Kozuimi was behind the much loved Spaceworld 2000 realistic Zelda demo before we were bait and switch betrayed by Nintendo/Aonuma with the atrociously ugly slap in the face kiddy abomination that was Wind Waker.

In closing I suffer (playing and buying Aonuma's dreck in order to review it) so YOU the amazon customer and gamer don't have to.

Please don't let my sacrifice be in vain.

Sporting games, in particular, will appeal in different ways to different people, so find something that's compatible with your likes and dislikes. This game was certainly not for me. I'm a big fan of World Series 2K1 & 2K2 for the Dreamcast, and only hope they pump out a version for the XBOX. Here's a few rants that turned me off immediately.
>>> Corny music.
>>> When you're at the plate, the hitting indicator shows you where the ball is going to be pitched! Granted you don't know if it's a curve or a two-seamer or a sinker, but still, come on! Doesn't this take some of the challenge away? Is the catcher letting you know what's coming or something? ala, Crash Davis from ""Bull Durham?"" ""...here comes the deuce, and when you speak of me, speak of me kindly...""
>>> Is it just me or is this some kind of ""midget"" league? The players are proportioned like infants, with extra large craniums who appear to be looming at a mere 4'9"".
>>> Bad sound effects. The crack of the bat (which the Dreamcast simulated beautifully) sounds anything but.
For me, these CONS jumped right out at me and I was unable, in good conscience, to proceed any further. These are some basics that are critical in simulating the most realistic play possible. GOOD NEWS:  I just read the May XBOX Magazine and they are collaborating with WORLD SERIES BASEBALL (SEGA) for an EXCLUSIVE XBOX release in May.  How cool is this --- this is far and away my favorite baseball gaming package, and they're dissing PS2 on this release.  They're utilizing the full graphic capablility to create the finest baseball game yet.  I won't even rent this one --- I'll be buying immediately. Baseball is a huge part of my life, and a solid game is a must have for the season ahead!!

The game is glitchy, still, months after release.  To the point where less than 2 hours in I've had to restart missions because of getting stuck on scenery.

Lemme say that again.  I got stuck on scenery.  In a game designed entirely around climbing on scenery.

Early on, half of the people walking around were buried up to their waists in the street.

The awesome animation that the main character does when he's moving through a crowd?  Yeah, that's gone.  Entirely.  It looks like he is just shoulder checking his way through everything.  It's the exact same animation in every game. But for whatever reason they were having problems with copy and paste over at ubisoft.  Oh yeah. This is a game developed by people in french Canada, and France.  You'd think they'd spend just a little time getting some french accents maybe?  No.  It's lazy as hell. They recycle a bunch of British actors from the last game.  Then they have these british guys rattle off random french phrases for no reason whatsoever, and they even do that with english accents.  It's so weird.  There's a halfassed in game explanation for that, but you won't be thinking about that when some guy with a cockney accent yells at you for the 47th time.

The story is lazy and uninteresting.  In one of the most interesting historical periods in the franchise to date, they managed to screw it up. The big historical events get glossed over so badly that you wouldn't even recognize they were happening unless you were a history student, and then you'd just be disappointing.

It reminds me of a game I picked up awhile back, forgot the name, but on the back it said it was a 'Diablo like' game.  It was in really big letters, and I was jonesing for Diablo 2 which at the time hadn't been released.  Get it home, and put it in, and its a turn based strategy game....  Yeah, Diablo like my foot.
I describe Pool of Radiance: RoMD like this, a very slow Baldur's Gate.  My main problem is that the game plays very slow.  Second, multiplayer seems to be a huge joke, where DOES the multiplayer take up at, and does it have a story at all?  Third...well, the Third Edition rules.
This is my first contact with them, and I was really hyped to see them at work, since some friends of mine want to convert some of our all time favorite campaigns over to NeverwinterNights.  After this game, we may skip NeverwinterNights altogether....  To put it lightly...why in the heck is the Mage's spells based off of Charisma, can anyone explain this?
All in all, the game is a let down, its nothing more than a really cheap rip off of Baldur's Gate, yet turn based with the characters being so big that you can't see very much of the map at the time.  The upswing is that it is all 'seemless' in the fact that you don't have 'zones' per say, the areas can be very large in scale, so it makes exploring more interesting.
Final word, if you like playing with the 3rd edition rules, and can stand very slow game play, then nab it, because all in all, it actually is like sitting down and playing it pen and paper style, taking turns with initiative.

It has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it, especially if I have someone to play it with.  My girlfriend decided she'd dive into some game or another with me on the PS2, so we'd be playing together on one screen, sitting together on the couch, nice fire going in the fireplace, and so on.  I happily dug out this dungeon crawler that I'd gotten some time ago, but never played.

If you want only to know if Champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game, then you can stop right here, because this will take awhile.  The answer is ""yes,"" it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should.  You have a few different classes, you have a few different locales, you can kill things and take their stuff, and you can keep on doing that for hours, as the game offers three successive difficulty levels, each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges.  It supports up to four players locally with multitap, and has a client/server network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer running.

A few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes; healer, tank, ranged DPS (damage-per-second), and magic DPS, as well as a hybrid melee/magic class.  However, though they hit all the right notes in concept, execution is sloppy, to be polite.  The tank class, while quite hardy, has no real tools for managing aggro (who the enemy non-player characters are attacking), which means that the healer isn't really free to heal, since they're defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank.  The magic DPS class doesn't really do much damage, considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focus.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay, but it's frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings, sit down to play, and discover that there's really nothing like what was described in the manual, insofar as gameplay, anywhere in the actual game.  It's not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawler.

Champions makes use of a pre-patch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diablo-2/dp/B00002CF9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diablo 2</a>-style skill tree for each of five classes.  When I say pre-patch, I refer to the fact that when Diablo 2 first released, one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higher-level, and presumably better, skills later in the tree.  Towards the end of the game's life, later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree, such that ""maxing"" those skills, or raising them as high as the game allowed, wasn't necessarily a waste of points, since it improved the function of a descendant.

No such luck in Champions, as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them, but skills that often seem as though they're only in a certain part of the tree because there wasn't any better place to put them.  With a little digging online, you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level (some classes share a skill, but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each).  However, the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard, as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does, and the next level, if it exists.  There is also a surprising lack of skill-boosting gear in the game, at least so far as we've played it.

Combined with the all-sales-are-final approach to skill point management, the game progressively feels more and more punishing, as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly.  Not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of 20, such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns, but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in, only to discover you wish you hadn't, well.  Too bad.

In action, skills are assigned by means of an eight-way radial menu, managed with the D-pad, in concert with either the Triangle or Circle buttons.  This menu can be arranged from the character sheet, and used while playing, without pausing, to assign skills to either button.  When the action ebbs, it's a passable enough system, which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny, tiny buttons.  But when the blood and gore are a-flyin', its clumsiness is exacerbated.

Say you're a Cleric, for example, which often lives or dies by its numerous self-buffs, skills that improve stats in various categories for their duration.  For each of them, you must press and hold the D-pad in the direction of the skill you wish to assign, press the button to which you wish to assign it, then release the button, then release the D-pad, then press the button to actually cast it.  Then you get to repeat this process for each buff, all of which start with impossibly short durations, before finally re-re-assigning the button to a more regularly used active skill, like Holy Strike, a ranged spell attack.  Annoying enough when you're not even in combat, but potentially lethal to your character when you are.  (According to its manual,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Champions-Return-to-Arms/dp/B0007CGBDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Champions Return to Arms</a>, the sequel, solves this problem by allowing the player to press the Square button in combination with the D-pad to simply trigger a skill at that location, in addition to the assignment model from this game; a vast improvement, but that's another review.)

Like any other dungeon crawler, Champions is very loot-oriented, with the rapid cycle of kill something, take its stuff, equip it, and repeat generally making up the entirety of the game.  A storyline of sorts is sprinkled about here and there, but it's really just an excuse to change the backdrop and offer more things to kill, because those things have stuff you can take.  Whenever you're full, you use a gate scroll or one of the portal stones scattered about the landscape to return to the town for that act, sell what you don't want, keep what you do, resupply on health or mana potions, arrows, throwing spears, etc., and then return to the fray.

Unfortunately, the encumbrance system which limits how much you can carry (with the exception of quest items, which are uniformly weightless, regardless of how absurd that often is) is unbalanced and half-baked.  The answer is to raise your Strength stat, which directly increases the amount of weight you can carry, and/or to put points into a passive skill that every class shares, which increases the amount you can carry as well.

Naturally, this is a pretty useless skill for the Barbarian, which has a combat-based reason to raise Strength, as Strength impacts melee damage output.  On the other hand, this means it's also not really a problem for the Barbarian.  Unfortunately, our poor friend the Wizard has to decide where he wants to be wasteful; with a skill that has no impact on his already pathetic damage, or with a stat that's equally without value in all other regards.

Champions does make use of a slotting system, also very reminiscent of Diablo 2, wherein various items that have no purpose on their own can be irrevocably attached to an equippable item, provided it has enough slots to accept them.  These items can raise base stats like Strength or Intelligence, add elemental damage, provide resistance to such damage, etc.  Each comes in five tiers of effectiveness, but there is no mechanism by which lesser types can be cashed in for greater.  There is also curiously no level bar, or any other bar, to using them, although you cannot stack the same type multiple times in the same item.  That is, if you slot a rune into your sword that raises Strength by 45, you cannot put another one into that sword.  You can, however, put one into every single other piece of equipment you have (provided it does not already have a Strength bonus), effectively raising your Strength by over 300 right at level 1.  (For scale, your starting strength is anywhere between about 25 and 50.)

There is also no storage area, so if you find something that is for a Cleric but you're a Barbarian, and you think, ""I'd like to make a Cleric and use that item,"" you will need to survive the obstacle course that is Champions' save and load system.  While your current game is indicated with an asterisk in the save and load menu, the rest of the data is almost uniformly worthless.  It tells you to which difficulty the game is set, it tells you the date and time it was saved, and it tells you the area in which it was saved.  No character names or levels, nothing to tell you who's actually in there.  That wouldn't be so bad if the entire save and load system didn't take so long or occasionally crash the system.

If you are careful, though, you can work around the lack of a vault by spawning endless copies of mules, characters who serve no purpose other than to store loot.  And since you can load any character into any game at almost any time, regardless of difficulty, you can also make as many copies of that loot as you want.  While this makes for some insanely overpowered items when slotted with infinite copies of socket items, it simultaneously neuters the cool-sounding ""unique"" items.  Ordinarily, if you couldn't make infinite copies of everything, finding a named chest plate, for example, that has a couple so-so mods and one free slot would be a boon.  However, given the choice between that item, or one with a similar armor value, and three slots, the decision is obvious.

The resistances, which can also be acquired on some jewelry, range from the very obvious (fire) to the completely obscure (magic).  But, much like the skill tree, since it's never really clear exactly what resistance does (whether it be reducing your chance to be hit by the damage type, or reducing the amount of damage you suffer from it), and in some cases, it's not even clear with which damage type you're being attacked (unfortunately, ""not fire"" isn't a category), the advantage of having some is equally murky.

And then there's presentation.  Voice actors don't seem to be sure what sort of accent they're affecting, and sadly, however unsurprisingly, a clear gender bias is present throughout.  Leave a female Shadow Knight idle long enough, and she'll let you know that ""if you keep looking at me like that, I'll have to charge extra.""  Because she's... already charging you to look at her?  You know, like a woman.  Take her into a lava-filled cavern, and the first thought that pops into her head, predictably, is that ""this place is hotter and steamier than I am.""  But, aren't you also really handy with a sword?  Sure, but who cares about that?  Hot and steamy!

I realize this game is now over six years old as I write this, but even today, this remains a real problem with this industry in general.  I understand target markets and all that, and I don't see anything wrong with visually pleasing characters of either gender being used to draw an audience.  At the same time, however, for the gaming industry to muse upon the mysterious, illusive female gamer while simultaneously and needlessly filling the huge majority of games with any sort of violence with such shameless sexism is hypocritical, not to mention lazy and pathetic.  Its degrading to women at large, and insulting to male gamers as well.

For the meat of the gameplay itself, there is some faint glimmer of elegance, as upgrading the speed of your weapon by way of a misty globe series socket item will change the pace with which you may use it.  That does not mean, however, that you can get away with just mashing the button as fast as possible, and capitalize on this.  It means instead that you must find the precise rhythm your weapon's speed requires (at the default speed, and each of the five varying tiers of misty globes), and tap the X button accordingly.  If you manage to do so, you will be rewarded with that increased attack rate, which offers potentially significant boosts to your damage.  It's not much, but frankly, in one of the worst dungeon crawlers I've played in years (and that's saying something), it's a welcome relief.  A game that was made bearable almost entirely because I was playing with my girlfriend, as we at turns shook our heads in disbelief at some aspects, and laughed at others, sometimes because we just didn't know what else to do, was elevated somewhat by the discovery of a crude semblance of challenging gameplay.

On the other hand, faced with more than two or three enemies at a time, at least in a two-player simultaneous game, the engine chugs, and there is noticeable slowdown.  This of course impacts that timing in a way that isn't quite sporting.  Mind you, it's still painfully easy to slog through the enemies of this game.  Player deaths are few and far between, and owe in equal measure to tactical error, a random itch now and again, and the occasional sudden appearance of absurdly cute little kittens in various unexpected parts of our home, the latter two of which we have found far more interesting.  The discovery that there was actually some challenge to aspire to meet anywhere in the game at all was a godsend.

I could go on for hours about everything that's wrong with this game, and cover what's right in just a few short sentences.  But, as I said, I'm generally pretty easy on this kind of game.  Can I kill stuff?  Check.  Can I take its stuff?  Check.  The graphics are as good as anything else on the PS2, so I should be good to go, right?

First, the story.  The cutscenes look great, but the whole premise of a writer who lost his manuscript pages and is trying to find his supposedly dead wife is really BORING.  There were not enough thrills, chills, and gore in this game for me to really enjoy it and classify it as horror.  At best, it's like an Are You Afraid of the Dark? episode from Nickelodeon.

I followed the instructions and successfully ""calibrated"" the cable on my family's downstairs TV first.  Then I hooked up my Wii via the cable to my computer monitor.  Please note that you need another VGA to VGA cable in order to hook it up to your monitor.  Luckily, I had one of those on hand...

So after setting it up, both audio and visual worked, and the colors looked fantastic.  However, after a few minutes of playing, the screen would suddenly fade to black for 2 seconds, and it kept on doing that every few minutes.  It's VERY annoying!!  This seems to be a common complaint for a lot of consumers, and after scouring the Internet for answers, I could not find any.

I know the problem can't be my monitor because it's top-of-the-line.  My Wii settings were all set perfectly at 480p, widescreen or standard (doesn't matter, I got the same 2-second black screen).  SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM??

My guess is that the cable is faulty or built incorrectly.  Maybe that extra VGA to VGA cable you need is screwing up the transmission somehow?  The connection is a little loose there, too..like you can't screw in the male VGA into the female VGA tightly enough since there are screws on both ends.  The problem definitely is not with my monitor at all, that's a fact.  I'm not sure what alternative I have left...maybe purchasing a VGA to HDMI cable (although I read that's impossible without also buying a converter)?  I don't know, but if I don't get an email response and a definitive answer within a week from Sewell Direct (where I bought it from), I'm returning it for a full and unquestionable refund.

I'm going to be moving next year, and I really don't want to have to purchase a TV just to play Wii through the component cables (I don't need cable television since I have Netflix on my PS3 through my monitor).  So when that time comes, this thing HAS TO work on my PC monitor; otherwise, I won't be able to play Wii at all.

This review will be updated again.  If I get an answer that allows me to stop the black screen fades, then I may add a star or two.  If I don't get an answer or the problem continues, I'm downgrading this review to one star, getting my refund, and filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against Sewell Direct for selling faulty equipment to the American consumer and charging him/her for it.

UPDATE:  I notified the manufacturer about the black screen issue, and they told me that it's due to the Wii overheating and that Nintendo has done nothing to address this problem.  I'm not sure if that's just a blame-game type of maneuver, but I wound up emailing Nintendo, and they told me to call them.  I don't know why they couldn't resolve this through e-mail and tell me what to do.  The black screen only lasts for 2 seconds every 4 minutes or so...not that big of a deal really.

Yes we all know past games of the series have had dislikes but this new installment is an Adventure of Disappointments.  Now I am not saying this game needs to go into file 13 (the trash) but I would say rent this game first or wait till the price is more worth its true value.

  The adventure starts in the floating city of Cocoon.  Humans are protected by a mysterious race called the fal'Cie.  Once Cocoon's government targets humans from Pulse (after actions of a rogue fal'Cie) the world underneath Cocoon, a mission to resuce a friend begins.  Now lets talk about the characters!  Well we have six primary characters.  Overall I would say these characters are my least favorite of the Final Fantasy Series passing by Final Fantasy 9's heroes on my list.  First we have Lightning that gives of bad feelings with overtones of menace.  Hope is an orphan and I would have to say very whiny!  Snow thinks he is a stud and Vanille is not only spacey but runs at the mouth a lot.  Now Sazh seems to be a big fan of Chris Tucker in the way he acts and he appears to have the most level head out of everyone in your group.  Last but not least is Fang (female) who gives off some exotic appeal.  So in my opinion Sazh and Fang are the most colorful characters that keeps the whole group from being a total irritation.

  For the first 23-25 hours! (not an exaggeration) your characters are put into groups of two/three and go about exploring Pulse.  The story is strictly LINEAR!  That means no towns to vist and no interesting side characters.  Here is what you do:  walk, fight, walk so more, fight some more, check out some noninteractive cut scene, fight again and then save your game.  Now don't get me wrong because FF 13 does have some bright spots and it is time to mention some.  EYECANDY!  If anything can be said about Final Fantasy it is that the graphics seem to always get better.  I guess this is why it takes them so long to bring out the next game in the series every year.  The landscapes are breathtaking and the character animation is vividly lifelike!  You can say in the graphics that Final Fantasy XIII is poetry in motion!  I am also glad to see the vast assortment of human villains and monsters to fight.  NOW! If you can hold out through about 2/3 of the game the action will start to flow out beyond the straight-ahead path and you will see how characters' stories coalesce.

  Battles leave you in control of one character and the computer plays as the others.  However, you can still give some help to the other characters and change their specialties when needed so you can survive battles!  Over all I would have to say the battles are more at a faster pace which is why you are mainly taking care of one character during battles.  I always enjoyed having total control of my characters during battles but I can see some pros in this new battle system because it still demands various levels of strategy.

  All in all, Final Fantasy needed to make a big impression on gamers for the current generation of high-definition consoles.  Final Fantasy did on the graphics and did so-so to alright on the battle system but it failed on adventure.  I don't want to be mean to ""Lightning"" but I would have been happier with Cloud or Auron-like characters taking her spot.  I believe the loyal fans of Final Fantasy will endure through this title and take the good points of this game as you would food from a vast buffet.

First off, this is a wired controller. I personally don't mind about this since you don't have to worry about batteries dying on you. The cord is braided and long enough to play from several feet away so this wasn't an issue to me. As a side effect, it seemed like the rumble feature was stronger, since it doesnt have to worry about battery life and the rumble draining it.

Going with the weight of the controller, it feels a little too light and flimsy. The plastic shell feels kind of cheap, though the rubberized coating is a nice touch. Its about the same size as a Microsoft controller, though less rounded with more straight edges. It felt roughly the same in my hands though.

The analog sticks on the tournament edition are adjustable which let you twist the sticks to adjust the tension. A good idea in theory, but executed poorly in this case. When tightened the movement just doesnt feel right and is uneven where you have to apply more pressure the further you push the stick. It just makes the analog sticks feel worn out and old doing this. However, when loosened all the way, the sticks did feel fine so I just left it at this setting.

The 2nd feature of the tournament edition which the standard didn't have, was the light up A B X Y buttons. It seemed like a nice feature until you realize that its very distracting when you're playing in a dark room and the buttons are very bright. Its like going to a movie theater and having someone whose got their cellphone on a few rows ahead of you. It just takes your attention away from the screen where it should be. The buttons themselves get some getting used to. They're a lot lower than the standard controllers buttons and instead of having to push down on them until the rubber part clicks in, its instead the same as a mouse button and takes little effort to push down until it clicks in. I guess its more of a preference of which style you prefer.

The triggers seemed ok for the most part, although I did not like the way they were angled. It would have been more ergonomic to angle them further down so when you pull the triggers, it pulls in horizontally toward you, instead of vertically with the controller. The LB and RB buttons are different on this controller, and it takes more pressure to push down on them than the standard controller. They felt a bit cheap. The interesting thing is that the LB and RB buttons are behind the programmable buttons which to me was a bit confusing, so instead I just mapped those two buttons to the LB and RB functions, so I have two buttons that do the same thing.

The start and back buttons are poorly place on the bottom of the controller and you have to reach fairly far to get to them. Theyre flush with the shell so its a little difficult hitting the button sometimes.

The DPAD, unfortunately, is the absolute worst part of this controller. The way this controller was designed apparently, was to only play games that use the thumb sticks to move around and use the DPAD just for action buttons like changing your weapon and things like that. The DPAD consists of four separate buttons that are raised up very high. If you want to play a side-scroller or fighting game with this controller, you will have A LOT of difficulty doing so. The DPAD was just a horrible idea. Even as action buttons, the standard DPAD on the Microsoft controller does a better job.

In all, I suggest trying this controller out first if possible before buying it. The two features of the tournament edition- adjustable sticks and light up buttons, are not worth the extra money. This just feels like a cheap cash in, and Ive read a lot of complaints of the controller failing after a few months and Razers support being awful. At its price point and with all its shortcomings, I just cant recommend this controller.  2/5

The cord has a special plug on the end so it can't be replaced with a longer USB cable.

First and foremost, the load times, even if you install this game on your hard drive, are unacceptable. And in nearly every mission, your traveling across 4 maps there AND back. Factor in a bunch of cut scenes and half your time is spent just waiting to play.
Which brings me to the next issue, Saving. The save points can be tough to find, the map can be a little tough to navigate, you can't set waypoints on it, and theres NO autosave function. Which means when the rediculously hard boss you stumble across tears you a new one, you have to do everything over, and wait for all the cut scenes to load again.
Since were on the subject, the boss battles are VERY difficult. It's like they set it up so that you basically have to cheat to win each battle. Especially since they are all much stronger, and about twice as fast as you are. But beat them quick because your on a schedule!
That's right, There's a time limit for EVERYTHING in the game!! So run across 6 maps, kills the boss, rescue survivors, search or weapons and health, but do it quick because if you don't, opportunities to get special items and will disappear forever.

All that seems to have changed with the New Motion Control is Fade.

You have little control over power, the swing gauge come up after you swing? It only puts a percentage (%) on screen and that's it.

Sure you hit as hard as you can on TEE OFF, but its when you get close to a hole or putting is where it has no accuracy what so ever, pops up like 72% your supposed to hit..? How?. You have no way of knowing.

You can hit it soft or hard it makes no difference on the distance. I don't know how many times on the Green I was 10 yards away from hole and it went 25 yards past the hole, or the ball went 2 feet using the exact same swing.

Expect frequent over shots over the holes and under shots as well.

Mini games are ok if your playing with someone because they have to play with the same poor, inconsistent control scheme as you, which makes it even.

Frisbee game, you throw it hard it goes 90 yards, throw it soft it goes 148 yards?? Throw it real soft and it fall at your feet. Poor quality.

Its fun to be able to swing your arms like a real golf club, but when your in a tournament and one hole you get par the other your 8 over and have to start over again it gets disappointing and annoying.

As mentioned in other reviews the home and power buttons are extremely hard to push. The + and - buttons are somewhat hard to push and the 1, 2 and A buttons are easy to push but you still will be pressing the cover to push the button.

Even though there was already a hole for my rechargeable battery I can't use it since the cover prevents me from putting it in the charge station.

Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2 is the sequel to Star Wars Dark Forces. It follows the story of Kyle Kataarn. A young Jedi straddling the line between the Light and Dark side of the Force.
I realise that this game is over seven years old. But still when held against games such as Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (which was released the same year) this game looks graphically challenged. The characters are rather stiff and rigid looking and the environments are extremely bland. The gameplay fares no better. It esentially consists of running around blasting and hacking various non-descript bad guys (and later Stormtroopers) with little rhyme or reason. Occasionally there are Boss battles but those are often frustrating. Eventually you are rewarded with different Force powers, none of which seem to work very well. The controls will often have you fumbling to find the right key for the right weapon or Force power. Also, our man Kyle is not exaclty the heartiest hero on video game. He is often easily overwhelmed and collapses in a heap making you restart the level. The level map is not very helpful either.
All in all I have to say that the game's biggest downfall is it's age. It just hasn't held up well over the years. Unless you're a collector or a Star Wars fanatic, it's best to stear clear of this game. It wasn't very fun to say the least. Spend a few extra bucks and either pick up Jedi Knight 2 Outcast or even Jedi Academy.

2.0,False,"02 16, 2011",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B004BJ4HDC,Lisa Shea,"A spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series, ""Dungeons"" gives a good attempt but misses out on a lot of the things that made DK great.

Like Dungeon Keeper, Dungeons is a game about, well, building a dungeon. In DK, the goal was to set up an ecosystem by keeping monsters happy, harvesting gold, and killing heroes who intruded on your underground lair. ""Dungeons"" takes a different approach: the goal is to make the heroes happy, thus raising their ""soul energy"", and then killing them when they're happiest. Therefore, while DK focused on building different rooms to accommodate your monsters, ""Dungeons"" has rooms to attract heroes based on their differing needs.

There are three major resources in Dungeons. The first of these is ""prestige"", which is gained by placing atmospheric items, such as flickering torches, dusty coffins, and piles of bones, around your dungeon. Building up prestige unlocks new items and objects. The second resource is ""souls"", which is gained by killing happy heroes and is used to build prestige items. The third resource is gold, which is used to buy things like monsters and room accessories, but can also be set out as a lure for heroes (though it's best to kill them before they escape the dungeon with it).

One thing that bothers me about Dungeons is that the setup leaves little room for creativity. Unlike Dungeon Keeper, where rooms served a direct purpose, the purpose of rooms in Dungeons is to lure in heroes - warriors will try to steal things from armories, wizards will peruse libraries, and...that's about it. There's no sense that you're actually building a working dungeon, it's just a dungeon-themed park. Monsters show up as guards or speed-bumps for the heroes, but their involvement in gameplay is limited to plopping down a spawn point. There's no sense of actual management, which makes it tactically limited.

Most of the ""choices"" the game offers have to do with a new addition to the game - your avatar. This is an armored, Sauron-like fellow who the player upgrades with better stats and spells. The majority of upgrades apply to him - carrying out sub-objectives grants him better stats and more spells, and not much else. This character receives far more focus than he ought to, especially given how limited the actual dungeon-building is. He feels totally unnecessary - all the upgrades that go to him should instead go to the dungeon, which is far too limited as it is.

The game looks and sounds reasonably nice, but it's just impossible to get into it. It feels like a waste - they made all these nice graphics and designs, and then threw them into really awful gameplay. The dynamic is so simple that it's ridiculously easy to run out of things to do, so the game just builds up more and more in terms of levels without adding anything of substance. Overall, I wanted to like Dungeons, but it just wasn't going to happen. Fans of Dungeon Keeper should understand that there's really nothing that the games have in common except for the fact that they both take place in dungeons.

2.0,False,"08 2, 2009",AN81JUYW2SL24,B000X9FV5M,Dr. Speed,"Farcry 2, where to begin? First, the graphics and overall visuals are exceptional. There are limits to the amount of damage you can do to the environment. Only certain things burn or break off, and it is really cheesy by the time you get the hang of it. You can't just set fire to the entire forest because even dry bushes burn out by themselves. Pyromaniacs will be disappointed.

The gameplay and weapons physics are the worst parts of the game. Weapons seem to rust and jam very frequently and it takes the reliability upgrade to make the weapon last longer than 2 missions. There is no lean or prone command for your character, which reduces the tactical nature of the game.

The worst aspect is the brain-numbing traversal system. Going from Point A to Point B is awful. If you drive a car, you run into a technical within a few minutes. The checkpoints are always hostile. This game offers no satisfaction in maintaining a reputation level since there aren't any true allies. You might as well walk from point to point, which takes even longer. You cannot get rid of enemies at checkpoints on a permanent basis. They always respawn.

The Jackal character pisses me off. His voice acting is horrible and he makes you do the stupidest things to progress in the game. The missions are linear and idiotic in nature: blow this pipeline, take out this convoy, etc... The ending has to be one of the worst game endings in history since it offers a really dumb choice for the character. The malaria system makes the gameplay boring, not exciting.

The weapon selection isn't terribly exciting. The primary weapons range from sub-machineguns (like the MP5SD) to rifles (A modified M16, AK47), to sniper rifles (Barrett M95, Dragunov SVD), and even a semi-automatic Milkor MGL 40mm grenade launcher made in South Africa. Secondary weapons are mainly pistols (Desert Eagle .50, Walther, Colt 1911) but also include the M79 grenade launcher, flare gun, and IEDs. You always get a machete, but a special weapon choice is also available. Here you can choose from a PKM machinegun, the M249 SAW, RPG, or a Carl Gustaf M2 anti-tank weapon (think Bazooka) that you can guide like a TOW missile from Battlefield 2.

Overall, the visuals are only so-so. They might appeal to gamers that think Crysis was amazing, but it still isn't very realistic. After playing Farcry 2, I think I will skip out on playing Crysis and Crysis Warhead because both of these games seem to focus on style over substance. It would take one heck of a plot and unique gameplay to convince me to fork over money for Crysis Maximum Edition.

Bottom line, Farcry 2 has a sub-par storyline, poor voice acting, horrible gameplay, and I wanted to just get done with the game ASAP. It is that bad. The game also crashes intermittently about every hour of gameplay. I know several other people that tried Farcry 2 and they all said it was a frustrating experience. The game just plain sucks because I did not feel any type of connection to the characters or the plot. I didn't care what happened after 50% of the game because it was just a lackluster overall experience.

To improve the game, they need to revamp the checkpoint system and enemy AI. They should also import the tactical system and weapon handling system from Rainbow Six Vegas/2.

Pros: Decent visuals, some nice explosions and brushfires.

Cons: No substance! Horrible: gameplay, characters, storyline, etc...

The story is very badly told. It is uninvolving and uninteresting, at all times. Four chapters into the game I still have no idea what's going on, what happened, who I am fighting and why the characters are fighting. (except that they die or something if they don't complete this impossible mission, or something gay like that.) All the cutscenes and CG scenes make no sense. The game throws random terms at you like fal'Cie and ""The Purge"", with no explanation as to what they are. I think you are supposed to learn about them as the story progresses, but I just plain don't care anymore after 4 chapters.

Music is as unmemorable as ever. Very generic and uninspiring sound. There is nothing profound or touching. Maybe I'm not far into the game to hear the main theme? But FFX draws you in with To Zanarkand right from the beginning, FFVIII opens with the powerful Liberi Fatali, FFVI has the opera Maria and Draco, and FFIX opens with a very soothing prelude to Melodies of Life. For the most part the music in FFXIII is like generic elevator music, it just doesn't help with the story telling at all.

Combat. Combat was designed to distance you further away from the characters - you don't even get to control them. You just set up ""paradigms"", which is like preset AI script. Each one focuses on ""healing"", ""physical attack"", ""magic damage,"" stats boost, enemy stats down, etc etc. You get to only control the team leader, but even then all you do is select ""auto chain"" and watch the animation.

The combat is unexciting and slow. In chapter 4 where you don't have ANY form of physical damage output, it takes about 5-10 minutes just to kill one single enemy, and every encounter has about 2-3 enemies. And all you do is smashing ""auto chain"" the whole time, occasionally switching from magical attack to healing.

During the past few months I've forced myself to load the save and continue playing, but I could never make any progress.

I know that modding these games is a full time job but I did that with Oblivion and I shouldn't have to mod a modern game to make it decent.

First off the game has some faults to begin with, the graphics are a bit dull if you ask me.  The characters are kind of on the blockish side, they walk around as if they have spoons up their behinds.  This might pass on the PSX but it's not acceptable on a console like the PS2.  The characters and visuals seem pretty stale when compared to the sheer romantic artistry and beauty that goes beyond explanation of Final Fantasy X, but of course what doesn't.  That's why Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy and Xenosaga is... well Xenosaga.
The Xenosaga plot seems pretty interesting so far, but again this is an RPG and interesting might not be enough.  When I first started Final Fantasy X, I will admit I wasn't too trilled but then something happened.  I can't pin point the exact moment but it was pretty early in the game when it just grabbed me and never let go. Can't say the same for FFX-2 however.  Moving on, I have a feeling Xenosaga has a super great plot, but unfortunately I may not get to experience it because the gameplay has one huge flaw that I don't think I can handle.
I was interested in Xenosage because it was supposed to be an epic RPG.  I play RPG's for the involvement in an epic storyline, I don't play RPG's for gameplay.  I feel sorry for anyone who plays RPG's for the menu selections, if you want gameplay there are better genres out there.  I always scratch my head when people complain about too many cutscenes in an RPG or that the game doesn't have enough exploration.  If you want gameplay and exploration go play something else.  That's the problem with Xenosaga, it's not just an RPG it's also an adventure platformer and not a very good one at that.  The platformer part of Xenosaga is suppose to be the second hand focus of the game and the quality of it shows that, but there seems to be too much of it.  There are too many enemies to be avoided by actually using your skill with the controller.  There are too many keys to find, too many doors to unlock, and all sorts of rooms that will get you lost.  It's not like it's there just incase you want to look around.  Nope, you find out you need to go somewhere but the map doesn't show you where, you have to search for it yourself.  This is just not what I look for in an RPG.  If this doesn't change in Xenosaga soon, I'm afraid I'll have to can it.",RPG or adventure platformer?,1052179200,2,,

Blacksite: Area 51 is more or less a follow up to the aforementioned game, in which you play a soldier and find yourself searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, only to uncover an alien conspiracy.  The first thing you'll notice about Blacksite: Area 51 is that the game is boasting some spectacular graphics.  The characters, aliens, areas, and environments are beautifully rendered; making the game a joy to look at, but that's about it.  The use of squad tactics doesn't work very well, and you'll mostly find yourself engaged in battles with your squad not doing much to lend a hand.  It should also be noted that there are a fair amount of glitches and bugs that occur now and then, ranging from graphical glitches to bugs in the gameplay elements.  The single-player campaign is decent enough, albeit much of the shock value and scares that were featured in the last Area 51 game are absent.  The multiplayer mode is uninspired and boring to say the least as well, which is even more disappointing.  For all its flaws though, Blacksite does offer some solid moments of intense action, and the political commentary does conjure a smirk.  All in all though, Blacksite: Area 51 is a disappointing FPS that could have been so much better than what we get here.

Seriously, Ubisoft: fast travel is a step in the right direction, but all of the horse riding in AC3 STILL managed to bore me into tears. And who thought HERDING PIGS was going to be fun, of all things? Even the hunting part of the game, which showed promise in the previews, turns out to be a trivial and repetitive exercise.

There are too many negatives about playing Grand Theft Auto III due to numerous useless and pointless missions, limitedness of freedom, repetitive playing, constant use of X button, lack of ability to save the game when needed, and ridiculous storyline and miscellaneous information. Let me get the positives out of the way first. For one, Grand Theft Auto III looks cool for its playing features, and the ideas of what to expect are of high level. There is a plenty to do around each of three islands. It took me about a couple of months to beat Grand Theft Auto III, so more bang out of the money. Several special types of missions are fun such as rampages and unique jumps. Now for the negatives as they are many of them. Novelty of a game can only wear off that it's no longer replayable. Grand Theft Auto III is no exception to this case. I beat this game a while ago, and I showed some interest in playing it again few years later. What I had forgotten about Grand Theft Auto III is how monotonous the game is. I perfectly outlined my objectives for each island of three: Cab, Fire, Cop, Jumps, Packages, RC Rampages, and Missions. Each of them (not the RC anyway) takes too damned long to finish. The worst aspect of Grand Theft Auto III is the dreadful Ambulance mission. It takes a good two hours to finish this one; there are twelve levels (level 1, save one person; level 2, save two persons; etc.). If the ambulance is either flipped over or shot up, I am back to square one and must do it all over again. In the midst of this, there is no allowing of saving at any point of the mission. It has to be completely done from start to finish. Actually, I reached level 12 and saved nine people. Then suddenly, I flipped the ambulance over not because I wasn't paying attention but my thumb literally got tired. Of course, my mind got numbed, and I grew frustrated at the idea of doing it again. I understand that those missions along with cab, fire, and cop are to familiarize myself with the geography of each island. My suggestion to improve the game play, why not just have 20 cab missions on one island, 20 fire the second island, and 20 cop for third island? Maybe ten levels of ambulance are okay and allow me to begin at the highest level possible where I screwed up. Whenever I am doing something on each island, ninety percent of the time my thumb is constantly on the X button. It gets sore after a while. The tedious driving around and going from point A to point B can be thought of preliminary stages of Alzheimer's. It's no fun. As for the real missions, they are all right for RPG but nothing special. The storyline is ridiculous at best; why not get the main character to make a name for himself as he rises to the top as Mafia hood boss or something? Speaking of the protagonist, who is he? What is his name? What does he really look like? What can he do? What is he interested in? The statistics are helpful, but must I know how many inches of rain fell, or total people wasted, or weight of explosives used, or total amount of money paid by cops? When I pointed out limitedness of freedom, mainly I have objectives that I must complete and when I am in midst of them, I feel the rigidity that I must follow this way and no other way. The game is not actually hard to beat, but it's not that easy either. All in all, Grand Theft Auto III is full of cycles repeated to death until 100% completion is reached. When that is accomplished, is there a sense of satisfaction? Not really.

I must be owed the entire planets weekly income times 100 by now. Remind me to send another complaint about not receiving my Price Is Right Prizes for this game.

Finally you get to start your game. You can chose to either play a 1 player game against the computer, or a party game which just means 1 to 4 players using the same DS. No WIFI game to chose? ... oh well, that makes sense I guess.

Then you get to choose your well thought out and brilliantly designed contestants that consist of a fat red neck woman, a limp wristed blond guy, a little old lady and the ever so popular army man, or general, or some dork everyone was screaming out to be a selectable character for a video game. But even worse, these are your only 4 to chose from, they really should have come up with something a lot better then these 4 sorry sacks of polygon.

So, into the game. You start off with 4 contestants, and quite remarkably, it's the same 4 all the time, it's the same 4 you get to chose as your character, imagine that! Ratings for this show would be through the roof every week seeing these four returning all the time.

So you get to see a picture of something to guess the price of it. They could have chose something more then grainy pictures as the prize to bid on, cause it always look like something you wouldn't pay 50 cents for, but everyone else bids around $1500 for it, so you enter your bid and if you win, you win and go to play the next showcase. If you lose, you get a strike and play the next showcase anyway.

Then you play 1 round of something from the show, some of them are ok to play, and some are damn right boring. But there is about 10-15 i dunno, could be 20 games to play all up. Then if you win you go to the big wheel, and if you dont, you get a strike and go to the big wheel anyway. And then either you or the computer spins to get closest to a dollar, and this thing you probably would expect you could either spin the wheel lightly or hard, to have a random chance of what number it falls on... but no, tap it lightly, or drag the stylus as fast as you can, it don't matter, it's going to spin and the same speed anyway. Which does not exactly make it fair as you let the computer decide what numbers your going to get.

Then if you win, you go onto the last round, and you see some more grainy pictures and bid how much ya think it's worth. Who knows, cause the game claims a couple of grainy pictures of chicks in bikinis are worth $37,000 and I got it way off by bidding 1 cent. Man, I could have sworn it was going to tell me I was correct. I usually just let the computer make it's bid and then bid the exact same number. Got a 50/50 chance of it working, but there's only a 40% chance of that.

If you lose, you go back to the opening round to bid on some more pixolated girls with grainy smiles holding a cane with a clock attached to it. In which there is no point playing, cause if you get it wrong, its your 3rd strike and game over, so you start again and play that same round with a new stupid picture of a toilet roll with iceypole sticks through it and a lady smiling and taunting you like, ""you have no idea what this prize even is, so how can you get the price correct""

So overall, i'd say if this game could show you a picture of itself, and say the item says 10 dollars, and should you bid higher or lower, i'd say bid much lower.

Also, admittedly, I'm used to playing co-op in more combat-heavy RPG formats (DIablo III, Dungeon Siege 3), so this game was a bit of a departure.

Pros: Yes, it has beautiful graphics. I'm glad to see so many people blown away by them, but they don't impress me all that much. Another pro is switching between characters during gameplay, which was very necessary during co-op play.

Cons: MONOTONOUS. Almost every single puzzle we encountered in our (co-op) hour of playing this game involved the wizard creating a box and moving it around. Somehow this is supposed to require creativity and be interesting? Hmmm. We found that one of us pretty much always had to stay the wizard for each level to create and manage our boxes to beat the puzzles. Also, the thief and wizard characters are weak when it comes to combat and die quickly. The wizard has no defense whatsoever, and the thief has a hard-to-wield/shoot bow. The controls for the weapons on the characters are not intuitive, and require a lot of effort in terms of aiming, etc. Characters die easily. Many a death occurred when one of our characters accidentally landed on spikes. Also, I'm not really sure why you need a thief given that in most of the levels so far, her skillset has been useless (grappling, shooting bows).

To be fair, we've only played this game about an hour so far, but I'm unimpressed, and am confused as to why so many people love this game when it feels like the solution to every puzzle is box creation and/or to float someone on top of the box to get somewhere. This game is not very intuitive weapon/control-wise and to me, it feels like the creative team spent way more time on the graphics than the puzzles or the characters.

If your character is Claire you can make fishing poles but can't use them, bow & arrow but can't use them, even diving has to be done by the males in your group.  I don't even know why she is able to make half the stuff available if she can't use it and none of her group will either.  She can't make rope, rafts, or furniture without a guys help.  The only thing the males can't do is basket weaving...and that is left to the only female character in your group that you don't find till much later in the game.

It is unrealistic to think a female stuck on a deserted island wouldn't/couldn't do these things herself.  Being so far into the game I don't want to start over as a male, but I hate that I am missing out on these other features just because my character is a girl.

I can only give the game 2 stars for their decision to limit the female characters in an unnecessary way.  If it weren't for that one major flaw the game would be 4-5 stars.

2.0,False,"10 9, 2012",A35VJC424AGADX,B0050SY4DG,MikeB,"Resident Evil 6 is not a bad game, but it is a disappointment. I thought RE4 and RE5 were great games, and I was looking forward RE6 taking it all a step further. Instead it feels like 5 steps backward.

STORY:
The game is separated into four campaigns, each starring different characters in the RE universe, some new, some old. The stories are all intertwined and you don't get the big picture until you've completed them all. This sounds cool in theory, but unfortunately the problem this causes is that each story has a fuzzy intro and then you're thrust into the middle of a s***storm with no context. Throughout most of Leon's campaign, he doesn't even know where he is going or what he is doing, and the character keeps stating this. This left me baffled and uninterested for the majority of the game, and when you do get the whole picture, the payoff just isn't worth it. The other problem with the story is the lack of pacing. There is no attempt to build tension. The game just starts with tons of enemies attacking you and doesn't let up. There is no ebb and flow, no variation, no tension, and thus what could have been exciting is just grating.

GAMPLAY:
The controls have been revised for RE6, and unfortunately they don't work well. No longer are you restricted to standing still while aiming, which is a nice thought, but now aiming is imprecise and the camera is unwieldy. More often the camera is interested in showing you your character's shoulder than what's in front of you, and when you can see in front of you, aiming is loose and often you'll miss a shot that you'd swear was dead on. Movement feels awkward and correctly facing interactive elements takes a few tries. There is a cover system a la Gears of War, but it doesn't work well, and most of the time it's pointless. Overall, the controls feel broken, and this is the biggest downfall of RE6.
The basic concept of any RE game is to explore spooky environments and kill zombies while solving puzzles. The element of exploration is gone thanks to very linear levels with virtually no branching pathways. Puzzles are reduced to simply picking up a keycard and using it at the next door you encounter. Zombies are so frequent, as is ammo, that the game lacks any excitement. It's hard to be scared when you already know there are more zombies waiting around every single corner. This is the least scary RE game ever. And by ""least scary"", I mean not scary in the slightest.

GRAPHICS:
RE4 on the Gamecube was the best looking game I had ever seen on that console. When RE5 came out, it was the best looking Xbox 360 game of it's time, so  I had high hopes for RE6's graphics. While RE6 isn't a bad looking game, it fails to impress. When compared to current games on the console, it's nothing special, and as a matter of fact, I don't think it looks as good as RE5. Character models are very detailed, but the environments look a little blurry and dull. Some monsters look good, while others just look like a pile of mush. Not what I expected from a series that has set the bar in graphics time and time again.

SOUND:
This time around, RE has taken a decidedly action-oriented direction, and the music reflects that. Ambient mood music is replaced with action-movie orchestral score. None of the music is memorable, as even as I write this I can't hardly remember it. Sound effects are pretty much the same gunshots and zombie moans that we've heard from past games, but I suppose that's expected. Overall, not bad, but nothing stood out as exceptional either.

OVERALL:
Considering how much fun I had with RE4 and RE5, RE6 was a let down. No longer is the game horror-survival. Now it feels like a poor-man's Gears of War. Chris' campaign is super action-heavy and feels like something out of Call of Duty. The game doesn't even try to be scary, the story is vague and confusing, the controls are wonky and imprecise, the camera is your worst enemy, levels are extremely linear, puzzles are stupidly simple, and there's no pacing to set the mood.  Most of the time I was playing this game, I was not enjoying myself. I only continued to play out of obligation since I payed money for it. It's not a horrible game, it's just terribly bland. I can't recommend this game to anyone.

Don't get  me wrong HOS still has that great polish that Blizzard puts into all of their games, a good balance for the races, a fleshed out storyline and the usual quality they put into their products but it is still lacking in several areas with their old trappings from SC2 back again, only much more this time around.

I really don't like how HOS is constantly holding your hand the entire time. I never felt like I got to really chose my own strategies and I constantly felt like Blizzard was right there holding my hand and telling me what to do. Every mission you are guided along being told which place you need to build on, which unit to use, how to use it, what you need to accomplish and such. Some missions do give you a bit of freedom but for the most part you are directed on what to do. I just wish I had more freedom in more stages of the game because to me that's what a strategy game is, getting to use strategy and come up with ways to win and it just isn't that much fun when the game is always telling me what strategy to use. I never felt like I got to stretch the old brain out and flex it somewhat with the game doing your thinking for you. You can definitely tell this is from Blizzard because hand holding has become their thing even like World of Warcraft is based around quests and dialogue that guide you, tell you exactly where to go and what to do when you get there with even raid encounters telling you what to do and warning you before a boss does some special attack. The entire time I'm playing HOS I just feel like it's one great big training level that never fully removes the training wheels. Age of empires or civilization would hold your hand but it wasn't long before those games would let go and let you go off on your own. HOS feels like an overprotective mother that won't stop looking over your shoulder.

The storyline which at its core was good and an interesting continuation it feels overly padded that gets a little long in the tooth after awhile. It had some great ideas in it that I enjoyed but there was too much of it constantly being shoved in my face. I don't always need every single detail of everything that's happening no matter how insignificant explained to me. The problem is a lot of the dialogue in the game just feels so needless and doesn't make me feel like I'm learning anything because it just feels pointless a lot of the time. I'm all for extra story and dialogue if it helps you feel more ""in the games universe"" because characterization is important but when it just seems like filler to pad out the game it means nothing to me.

I felt too rushed in most missions. It always seemed like there was a timer, or there was always something forcing me to constantly be moving ahead. Either I'm going to be destroyed, some beam is going to kill me unless I slow it down, a giant ship is heading my way, the enemy is going to escape, I have to gather something before the enemy does or something else. Which being rushed goes back to lack of freedom and lack of the ability to use strategy since those missions usually just mean you bulk up on troops and run out as fast as you can. I mean a good timed mission can invoke a sense of urgency and make you sweat a little but when you get 4 or 5 of them in a row, or every other mission is timed it gets old real fast.

This is a game worth playing but I can't recommend it for more than 20 bucks.

I got the collector's edition strictly because I am obsessive due to the fact I have the CE for wings of liberty and have to have this one to go along with it. But it has your very standard CE assortment like an art book, soundtrack cd, and assorted things like a mouse pad. Basically all stuff that will never leave the box.

What I've glimpsed of it in between the glitches, level resets, server kicks, and team boots is visually pretty and decently fun, like a far off land of happiness viewed through a grimy window.  Honestly, I've never seen a game this twitchy and unreliable, and I've played the Earth Defense Force games online on PS3. On the PS4, I routinely co-op with 4-16 players on highspeed Verizon Fios service and never have any connection problems -- except with Destiny.  Here, I've seen them all, as each Destiny server or network error has a helpful ""animal name"" to let you know what went wrong.  Let's say you've started a new zone with your friends.  All is well, you're blasting away, and then suddenly the screen goes black, and you respawn back at the beginning of the level all by yourself due to error code ""turtle.""  All your friends are now 10 miles away, wondering where you went and why mooks you should be fragging are now hitting them from the flank.  No worries!  You'll just start heading back up the hill towards them and -- whoops!  You're back at the beginning of the level again, this time due to error code ""monkey.""  In fact, now you can never get more than about 50 feet from the spawn point without passing out and reappearing there, something that stops being funny after the first few times.

Indeed, repeat that about 50 times, seeing different errors most of the time, and you quickly realize that Destiny is basically a militarized version of Groundhog day.  Just when you thought things were going well, the server decided you should instead relive everything you just experienced, and without the assistance of the rest of your squad.  Like Edge of Tomorrow, maybe someone killed you or you just managed to ""reset the day"" on your own.  But no matter, you at least got a funny animal name out of it.  Given that nothing even remotely like this level of instability is to be found in any other network games I play on the PS4, you have to wonder if it is intentional, something to add more challenges to what is already an interminable grind.  For me, at least, that question will forever remain unanswered, as I will never play this game again due to the frustration of losing blocks of time for no reason, and with no explanation beyond a silly animal error code.

But man, this is just boring.

There are no tactics or skills required to play this game whatsoever, you just mash buttons at hordes of enemies, level up and get better gear. As a single player game, it gets incredibly boring fast. Playing with others makes it a little more fun, but not much. There's so many better options these days, I really just don't get it.

Honestly the only reason people get hooked on this game, is the same reason people get hooked on web games like Farmville. There's just this compulsion to keep playing to acquire more and more virtual items. That's how Blizzard defines difficulty as well. In most RPGs, higher difficulty means enemies are harder to kill, you're easier to kill, and everything else remains the same. Meaning you have to adjust your tactics, prepare for big battles ahead of time, and plan your character progression more carefully with a focus on min/maxing. In this game, the multiple difficulty settings are just a way to compensate for the increased power you get with gear.

D2 practically created the RPG concept of ""endgame"". Where you hit max level, and then just grind for gear. WoW incorporated this idea as well with their raiding system. I just don't get the appeal of it, why would you want to rush through so much content to just do the same thing over and over to obtain a few virtual items? Well, there are millions who like this sort of thing, so maybe I'm the weird one.

Anyways, aside from it's rather uninspired gameplay, the graphics are dated, definitely not PS4 worthy, the story is absurd, and it's just plain boring to play.

If you want mindless hack n slash, there are so many other options out there, some free, some with much better eye candy. If you want a tactical RPG, this ain't it.

The scanning:  It is laborious, but if you stick with it eventually you can get a good scan.  The game does not take into account head shape or ears so after you get a scan you like you will need to do some fine tuning.  Once I got a good scan it was off to work myself up and become a true virtual NBA legend.  Or not.

The voice:  This is where I stop playing.  Shame I've wasted about $30 once I trade this in tonight, but it is what it is.  When you enter the game you have only 2 voice options - ghetto and even more ghetto.  That's it.  Every cut scene you get to see a resemblance of your face talking like you live in and grew up in the ghetto and if the voice wasn't enough to turn you off in just about every cut scene where you interact with your coach you have some snotty ungrateful snide remark to make.  Nope!  Not for me at all!

I think really it is a preference and for some people the voice overs won't be that big of a deal and I think if 2K actually made it where the voice dialogue was other than rude comments especially when the franchise is giving you a 10 day proving time I might be able to overlook it, but that is not how the game is.  Personally I don't like it and I can't get into it.

Gameplay:  The gameplay is lack luster, too in my opinion.  The menus are difficult to traverse and just know where to go to get started is a fumble.  Defense is difficult because your character doesn't move as fluidly or responsive as the player you are guarding.  If you are moving left and need to switch to the right there is enough of a delay to allow the person you are guarding to get by you and score.

Offence is not much better.  Shooting is hit or miss.  I like how they added the shot meter so I know the ""sweet spot"" when to release the ball on a shot, but there is still a large margin controlled by the computer and it's just random from there.  Free throws are anyones guess.  No meters no indication of when to release.  Repetition will be the only to get good at these.

Now, having said all this about the game play I will concede that I've only trained my player skills a couple of ticks here and there as they cost game money to increase and get expensive fast.  The above stated might change once you start getting some skills trained.

Overall it is not a good fit for me as I like to immerse myself into a game and between the voice of my character, rude and obnoxious behavior coupled with clunky and cluttered menus and difficult to master gameplay I cannot recommend this game.

always online sucks, yes they fixes the logon issue, so I can always logon without waiting. The problems I am having now is that I cannot load some of my cities at all. So many hours of work is wasted

Tourism is broken.  All the casinos and attractions suddenly lost all the customers for no explainable reasons. I have airport, rail, and ferry running, but all of a sudden people just decide not to visit.

Interactive between cities has lots of issues. Simcity try to be MMO, but they cannot do simple transactions right. Imagine that each city is a character in a MMO, and it takes 10+ minutes for each characters to exchange items/gold?  Do you want to play MMO like that?

Public transports just randomly pick and drop sims, and path finding has lots of issues. Some of the stores say no shoppers and some sims ask where is shopping, even they are right across the street. A $20 game like Cities in Motion does a lot better than Simcity in terms of path finding and transport system.

Rendering issues. Some of the buildings keep switching from invisible to visible back and forth. Sometimes when you have a quest, you get zoom in, but what you get is the back of some tall buildings because they are getting int the way. May be they should have an options to change theses behaviors?

It's single greatest strength is the game play mechanics of the bionic arm. The arm serves as both a weapon and a means of swinging from place to place, which for me was allot of fun while being very challenging. Unlike games like Prince of Persia where you just hit a button at the right time to ""link"" your next acrobatic stunt, in Bionic Commando you have to time your swings and line up your next swing with much precision and grace. Personally I enjoyed the challenge of perfecting my ""swing"", because it is lots of fun and soaring through the air has a sort of innocent quality that I very much enjoyed. Though the negatives are a lack luster story, mediocre graphics (though the environments themselves are well put together, the textures are just nowhere near as sharp/clean as they should be), and somewhat boring combat. The combat plays like an arcade shooter from 1995, no cover system (similar to Gears of War or Drakes Fortune is sorely lacking) and a very very basic AI hinder this game from being memorable in light of far more advanced games available on the market.

I've been desperately trying to find a good baseball game that a casual baseball fan like myself can enjoy on my Xbox 360. What I wanted was a next-gen version of something like a cross between Bases Loaded and High Heat Baseball. What I got was something apparently only the hardcore baseball fan can enjoy.

There's just way too much to learn in this game. I won't even begin to talk about what goes on off the field in this game. Fortunately, you can have the CPU control all of that, but knowing how that goes in other sports games, I figure the CPU probably is holding me back. But how should I know? I just want to hit the ball, score some runs, and strike some people out with great graphics as a bonus. Is that too much too ask? Apparently.

So here's my issue with the gameplay aspect, because I don't understand any of the general manager stuff that you control when you're not ""playing"".

Pitching: A lot of people do tend to have an issue with this, but I did get it down ... after a month of play. The control motions are supposed to mimic those of what you would actually do when pitching. So instead of something simple like holding a button down and pressing which direction you would want your pitch to go, you have to pull back on the analog stick, and motion it over to a certain spot, while doing all this with precise timing. If it sounds complex, it is. Your catcher is a complete moron, too. He'll tell you what pitch to throw and where to throw it. If you listen to him, you'll lose every game. If you don't listen to him, your artificial pitcher ratings will gradually drop. What gives?!

Batting: Oh my goodness. This is probably the BIG reason why I'm giving this game a low rating. I understand trying to make a game realistic, but come on. I don't know when I'm supposed to lean back, swing, guess where the pitch is going before the pitcher releases it with some invisible guessing eye thing, and aim for a certain spot on the field if I even get lucky enough to hit the darn ball. Yeah, you have to do all that. What ever happened to just hitting the 'A' button to swing, while moving the stick up or down to hit ball where it's going? Yeah, I guess the game developers thought that would be too easy or something. Can't have that! Oh don't get me wrong, there are classic controls. There's just one problem with this. You see you still have to guess where the pitch will go before you even swing. And if your entire line-up has a guessing eye the size of a dime, you still won't hit anything. Batting is just horrible. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating it is to go through game after game and get lucky to just get 5 hits and no runs. Meanwhile, the CPU seems to be able to hit every other one of your pitches, and hits home runs every other inning it seems.

Fielding: Forget about it, unless you plan on using classic controls. You trying and throw it to first, there's a good bet he'll throw it home or second or ... well you get the idea. Your fielder rarely throws it where you want it to go. Oh if you use the classic controls, yeah all those fielding achievements and stuff ... forget 'em.

What else can I bash this game for? Ah I'm done ranting. But seriously, if you're wanting a baseball game for your Xbox 360, and if you're a casual baseball fan like me, you won't like this game.

Having never played the Wii before, I was excited to try out Endless Ocean, and was quickly bored and somewhat disapointed. I'm not saying Endless Ocean doesn't have good graphics, I just am in that small minority pool of people who quickly got tired of swimming around and petting the fish.

I think, in my case, the problem is this: I live in Florida. I go scuba diving, boating, fishing. I've been on reef dives, explored sunken boats, swam alongside the coral, and been spearfishing a couple times. I just...well I had a hard time getting a thrill out of Endless Ocean, where I struggled at first to even float, then seemed to swim in circles and see the same fish when I finally went into other areas. I literally saw humerphead wrase about a hundred and fifty gazillion times.

And then I sat on my fake boat, walked around it, went back down, pet some more fish...got bored, and went to do something else.

Not that the fish in the endless ocean aren't sorta cool. You click on them to find out there names and info. The game just didn't keep me interested. I guess it was the lack of any real objective except swimming around an endless ocean that bored me. Maybe if a shark were to come up to eat me, accompanied by Jaws music, I would have played longer.

Mirror's Edge, from EA DICE, is as far as I know video gaming's first foray into the world of parkour. It executes the subject admirably. The innovative engine it uses to simulate running along rooftops and jumping from foothold to handhold to foothold is excellent; neither so difficult that it quickly becomes frustrating nor so forgiving that the player does not feel like he is working hard for every meter of ground. I frequently found myself holding my breath during particularly challenging leaps. The parkour portion of Mirror's Edge could be a game in itself. In fact, it probably should have been.

I bought Mirror's Edge despite warnings that it contained SWAT teams because I assumed that, as one friend described it, the enemies would be there to discourage slowing down. An important part of parkour is the speed with which one travels from point A to point B, and in a game with a plot that has nothing to do with the sport of parkour, there should be something in place to create a sense of urgency. I do not have a thematic objection to the presence of enemies in the game. Indeed, there are many ways that the police in Mirror's Edge could have been utilized well to encourage constant movement, and on rare occasion the game does hit on one or two of them. Unfortunately, the developers do not seem to have recognized their value, and instead incorporate enemies as an unpredictable and frustrating element of their puzzle construction.

In fact, despite the game's early warnings that hostiles should be avoided rather than fought, Mirror's Edge is constantly putting the player in situations where direct confrontration, if not conflict, is required by the environment. The player's radio contact repeatedly warns her to ""be ready for a fight"" from about the third chapter on. Police appear directly in the path of the player without explanation, even when that path involves overcoming considerable inaccessibility. And these are not the blue-uniformed pistol-bearing cops of the downloadable free demo. These are armored men carrying assault shotguns and rifles, and in some cases 50-caliber machine guns. If there is one message I want to express clearly in this review, it is this: the police are everywhere in this game. Expect the majority of this game to be parkour, but parkour under automatic weapons fire.

Even this could be forgiven, despite the fact that they are armed in this fashion to deal with the threat of a single woman armed only with her speed, if the police had good code governing them. But they do not. There is no stealth system in Mirror's Edge. Enemies become aware of the player when they are activated, regardless of the player's actions or concealment. And once they are aware of the player, they never lose track of her, no matter how insane or hidden her movements. The player will never step out of cover in Mirror's Edge and not be greeted by a hail of bullets. The police can and do track the player around corners and through solid objects.

In many cases, the police do not spawn until the player has wasted too much time in a single area, but this is not universally the case, and there are a few locations in the game that contain enemies from the start and require the player to perform a time-consuming task while there, outside of cover and essentially stationary. The game never explicitly requires combat, but when climbing a pipe or opening a hatch takes two or three seconds, and the pipe or hatch are not protected, failing to deal with the armed men beforehand has predictable results.

In the end, what makes the combat in Mirror's Edge a failure is not its inclusion but its execution. It would have been a simple matter to always have the police in a pursuit role, or if that became too contrived or difficult, to make the player significantly more vulnerable to gunfire while stationary and significantly less vulnerable while moving. Instead, the enemies are often directly in the players' path, and gunfire is extremely erratic, to the extent that the player can make a run under fire without taking a single bullet that on a previous attempt resulted in her being gunned down instantly - and vice versa. If a designer is going to use gunfire in puzzle design, their algorithms for accuracy simply have to be more reliable than that. The demo could be beaten without taking a single bullet by making no more than two well-aimed slide kicks. If the whole game had played like that, this would have been a very different review.

The only thing keeping Mirror's Edge from being a two-star game, despite the excellent parkour engine, is the time trial mode. These are genuinely fun rehashes of the parkour in the game's story mode, often with some changes to the required route to keep things interesting. Unfortunately, in order to unlock these, you have to first beat the story mode of the game. The speedrun mode of the game is just the story mode with a timer attached, and adds no real value. Hopefully, if DICE produces a sequel, they will make the time trials available from the start and will also do something to eliminate or at least reduce the ubiquitous combat content from the original. Mirror's Edge is not the game it should have been.

The final encounter of Mirror's Edge is a short, entertaining boss fight that does not involve combat (only about half the ""boss fights"" in the game don't), but rather quick and skillful use of parkour abilities. I successfully executed the required maneuver first try and happily watched the villain receive his comeuppance, only to then immediately succumb to the numerous high-powered gunshot wounds to my back. The experience defines Mirror's Edge pretty well, in my mind - a good game ruined by poorly designed content that was irrelevant to begin with.

2.0,False,"07 30, 2001",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00002STX4,Tsanche,"Batman Forever is a perplexing experience all on its own.  The original film, released in 1995 is one of the more divisive films in the entire franchise (it's neither universally loved nor universally hated).  Being a bit more kid friendly, light hearted and trying to be fun.  It's surprising then, that the video game doesn't even try to be fun or entertaining.  Batman Forever is a boring and monotonous game that came out in a time when creating video games based off movies were not always good... but they weren't exactly bad.  As a film Batman Forever is probably an okay outing.  As a video game it's a great cure for insomnia and a good lesson on how not to create a game.

I should note that Batman Forever was available on several different platforms.  The Super Nintendo version might've been slightly better than the Sega Genesis one, but merely because of the controls not necessarily because one console was better than the other.  Let's start with the basics though.  The game is based off the movie and divided into eight levels.  Before each level you get to choose two gadgets to take into each stage.  Batman has a good arsenal of tools.  You have the Bat Bola which can render enemies temporarily immobile, smoke grenades or even a device that makes you invincible so long as you're using it correctly.  Players don't just have to play as Batman either.  One can also play as Robin.  While Batman uses exclusively his fisticuffs, Robin actually has a staff he can use as well.  The two also sometimes get different gadgets they can choose from.  While Batman as pellets and grenades, for instance, Robin has a blinding light, tranquilizer darts and wrist rivets to stop enemies in their tracks.  There are also default gadgets the two have on them all the time such as the Batarang.

It may seem like Batman and Robin would play radically different, but they actually don't.  Each one of them has a set of universal tools.  Not just the batarang, but also a grappling hook to reach other layers of stages, tiny bombs to find hidden passages in the floors (and to deal damage to enemies etc.) and the same basic attacks.  Despite Robin having a staff it doesn't operate any different than Batman's fist.  The game won't be significantly easier if you use one character over another.  You might think their gadgets where they differ make a huge difference but the gadgets the game is made to favor are shared by both of them.  It might seem great to try to decide whether you should use Batman's slippery goo or Robin's Sticky goo but both tools are so horrible you'd never actually use them to begin with.  Both have the preferred Bat Bola and respective gadgets that will make them invincible when the gadget is active.  You won't find any significant difference in the characters.

Each level has lots of things to find.  There are items to pick up, enemies to vanquish and secret passages to find.  Some levels also have hidden blue prints and if you find them all you'll unlock hidden gadgets the two can use.  As with many of the gadgets, though, they're not really anything special.

The game has you traverse each of these stages, room-by-room, beating up the enemies, uncovering secrets and finding a goal.  The goal of each level isn't always specified.  While there is a small briefing before hand, most levels end once you finally get to the end and have dispatched all enemies.  Some stages have actual bosses to defeat such as Two-Face or The Riddler, but they're usually just glorified henchmen.  Most rooms just have you fight through thugs, each with a life gauge of their own.  Once it's depleted they're dead.  It's a typical beat-em up but without the usual elements that create a good beat' em up.  This isn't like Final Fight or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  The levels aren't short and snappy, there is nothing pressing you forward and you're on a single plain in a side scroller.  At first this is perfectly fine, but then the game begins to get really boring really fast.  Once you've played the first ten minutes or so of Batman Forever, you pretty much know everything you need to know about the game.  You walk into a room, beat up some bad guys and walk to the next room.  There aren't a lot of variations to it or specific goals you need find.  It's just you as Batman or Robin walking through a room and beating up people.  There are occasionally platforming moments, but they're frustrating thanks to the strange jumping mechanic that's made for combat and not platforming.

All of this brings together a game that's surprisingly boring to play.  The levels are lengthy but they aren't engaging.  Were it actually a traditional side scrolling beat 'em up it might've actually been okay, but instead it's a game where you go room by room.  But doing this isn't even all that great in and of itself as each time you enter a room you have to wait for the game to load each area.  For large stages with several rooms such as the first level of the game where enemies can knock you back into a previous room... this is going to get annoying.  The game even flashes the words ""Hold on,"" each time you go to another area.  The music also isn't adding anything to this either.  It's kind of boring and repetitive... but it also doesn't really pump you up or make you feel like Batman.  Take, for example, how the SNES version of ""The Adventures of Batman and Robin.""  Everything about that game reminds you of the animated television show it's based on.  Here you've got nothing that reminds you you're playing a Batman game.

The game also doesn't play well.  There are far too many things to do and not enough buttons, even on the Super Nintendo, to compensate.  Your grappling hook, for instance is mapped to the ""Select"" button and if you want to shoot it straight up you need to press ""Select+Up.""  The end result is that if you don't press them both exactly at the right time you end up just shooting your grappling hook to swing normally (a moment that is only actually needed ONCE in the entire game).  This sounds pretty bad as it is, but it's a nightmare when using gadgets.  The game itself makes you use gadgets the way you use moves in Street Fighter II.  This works for Street Fighter because it's a fighting game.  Here's it's awful.  When beset upon by several enemies at once it can be annoying to enter the specific commands for your gadget.  It also doesn't help that sometimes the controls aren't responsive to the inputs.

It doesn't matter anyway, you don't need you gadgets to take down enemies anyway.  The only time it's useful to have even one (the Bat-Bola) is when taking on Two-Face who is surprisingly the only enemy that's difficult to defeat otherwise.  Aside from that, the game isn't challenging at all, it's just repetitive.  From stage 2 and further along you'll mostly run into the same enemies over and over all capable of doing very similar things.  Sure you'll come across a Riddler Thug eventually or you'll fight clowns in the circus stage but none of these enemies have much of anything that separates them from the enemies you're already facing.  There's nothing unique, nothing that's visually striking.  Two Face is likely the only enemy that seems to actually be different from the onsalught of other thugs you'll face.  Even the Riddler (who is the game's final boss, by the way) fights almost exactly like the basic enemies you'll face getting to him.

Are there good points to Batman Forever?  Sure, but even they come with an asterisk.  For instance, the game has some decent animations and is actually quite visually appealing.  But the levels themselves are repetitive, utilizing the same backgrounds and designs constantly.  The game looks good I just wish there were more of it to look at.  The level design also isn't enough to actually distract you from the same constant backgrounds appearing constantly.  It also takes just a little too long to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  Each level grades you on whether you could find all the secrets in a stage or defeated all the enemies and the like.  Completing these tasks rewards you with extra lives but the game is so simple you won't need them... and these tasks needlessly pad out the game to a length it simply doesn't need to be.  There are no greater rewards for doing so.  All it does is prolong what will already feel like a long experience.

The game also doesn't have a bad soundtrack either.  It's surprisingly good.  The opening title theme and the music that plays in the stages is actually good.  It just sounds slightly (not always but slightly) out of place for a Batman game.  But for the most part it's good.  I even found myself humming some tunes.

Batman Forever is a game that's close to being good.  But the repetitive nature of its combat and the fact that you've seen and experienced everything there is experience with the first level alone makes it less fun to play than other games.  It's a pretty boring game that, for those who have time, can use it to kill two hours, but it's going to feel like it's far longer than two hours to complete.

So, here's Midway Arcade Treasures 3. This focused on all of Midway's greatest racing franchises. Granted, in the arcade, the machines were built like cars with steering wheels, gas peddles, and brake peddles, but they can still prove to be fun. The high-speed intensity is still there. The games are as adrenalizing now as they were back in their proper times, but they're not quite the same.

For the most part, the bulk of these games are actually ports from the Dreamcast to this collection. Certainly not a bad thing, but many of them won't have the coin-op feel if that's what you're really looking for. The framerates in most games stay consistent. The visuals are quite polished. And why not? The Dreamcast was a great system.

The problem comes in for the PS2 version. In previous Arcade Treasures, you were allowed to map the controls to whichever buttons you wanted. That's not the case with Arcade Treasures 3. No, instead, all games are pre-mapped and not done well. While in the GameCube and XBox versions, it would make sense to map acceleration to the R trigger and braking to the L trigger, doing this with L1 and R1 on the PS2 won't cut it. Things are different when it comes to the PS2. In PS2 racing games, acceleration is mapped to Cross, and braking is mapped to Square. This makes the game cumbersome to any PS2 gamer who regularly uses the standard PS2 controller for other PS2 racing games.

Bottom line: If you have a GameCube - or even a Wii, for that matter - buy the GameCube version. If you have an old XBox, buy that version. But if the control mapping doesn't faze you, then you may find something to like about this version. The overall emulation is still quite solid, and while some people would ask ""why would you wanna play old racing games,"" the rest of us will ask ""why not?""

Basically, the game is about when you are trying to get a position of a fighting actor or actress by the director who has been a complete failure.

The GOOD THINGS about Kung Fu Chaos:

The selection of things to do- Instead of just fighting, you have adventure mode, and also a fighting time where you fight about 15 minutes and see how many people you have killed for the last 15-30 minutes.

The creativity- The creators did a great job of making up places where they would have auditions. Falling down a escalator then explodes and all of that kind of stuff. It is very cool what they did with that.

The BAD THINGS about Kung Fu Chaos:

Replay value- Basically, replay value means how long you will be willing to play it. This game has a bad replay value. I stopped playing it in a few months. I found another game and started playing that instead.

The controls- When you first play, it should be a little bit diffucult about how this game is supposed to be played. Instead, there are so many controls that you don't know what to do. It took me a good week to understand the controls.

2.0,False,"02 8, 2013",A2HM2RMX1CBZGM,B0016BVY7U,Taylor M.,"I made some youtube videos here: [youtube.com/user/GamingTaylor]

I must say..I had high hopes for this game as Red Alert 2 was a childhood favorite. Playing Red Alert 2 is still great, acting, gameplay, missions, everything was about building a big force and crushing the enemy with power.

This game however....is a bit different....

At first it was enjoyable as I enjoyed the humor with the tutorial, and the beginning cinematic was quite interesting.

Even the graphics were pretty well made, although I may see why people wouldn't like the vibrant colors, and the small selection of units which does make the game feel ""childish""

The acting...is not great...definitely not anything compared to Red Alert 2, characters don't fit with the story, and the story is very odd. It begins with going back in time, killing Einstein, then coming back to the future and facing the ""Empire of the Rising Sun"" and the Allies...not only this, a heavy influence is put on every female model by showing their cleavage...I think this is in reference to Tanya in Red Alert 2, but she definitely did not look like a porn star (like some of these actors)

The maps...are strange...the second mission you are fighting at a carnival...why? what? war? at a carnival? You even see soldiers playing games, and you release the ""bears"" from the cages...so odd

The biggest point however is the gameplay...

1) A huge influence was put on building both land and sea...I'm not sure why...and most units can ""transform"" between navel and land or be on transports.
-In my opinion it makes the game very slow, and difficult to get troops ""into"" the battle.

2) Instead of building up an army you are instead supposed to build a small amount of various types, and use the strategy in their ""abilities"" and your ""special powers"" to complete the objective. Makes the game very slow paced, and often you feel like all the units are just weak.

3) Harvesting Ore has returned, but this time all you do is build 1 or two, and your done...basically taking the whole concept of resource collection, and throwing it out...

4) What really ruins the game for me is this ""co-commander"" business. They seemed to have made each mission ""co-op"" so you can play together with a friend online. HOWEVER, is you choose solo you get an AI to take their place, and this AI typically does everything for you....even in the second mission, they give the AI the ""super unit"" while you are stuck with some spider bots....sort of silly...

5) Very unbalanced...there's this huge gap in units....sometimes randomly a larger unit will appear and just wipe your entire army out, and you won't have much to defend, or....to kill it, you'll have to sacrifice your entire army.

Overall...even though I've only played about 4 missions + the tutorial...it's sad. By the time  you reach the 4th mission there will be like 4 different colored units on the screen, and you'll be in a base completely in the water, and it's sooooo difficult to get on land, because the enemies will keep attacking, and you always have low income because you only get two harvesters in like every mission which can't be expanded. (YES YOU CAN NOT EXPAND YOUR RESOURCE COLLECTION) Why? I have no idea....even in starcraft...resource collecting was a main strategy, now it's lost.

It ""Seems"" like the makers of this game wanted you to use strategy with units instead of building up your base/army, but it's very slow paced, and lacking in so many ways from Red Alert 2...making it boring...uninteresting...and childish. (Perhaps it ""was"" made for a younger audience) I'm not entirely sure...but it's definitely not anything special. if you look my youtube channel you'll see like the difference between the beginning of Red Alert 2, and Red Alert 3 (made videos of both).  Sure Red Alert 3 has nicer graphics...(a bit too vibrant/cartoon looking), but Red Alert 2 gives you so much more freedom, and actually challenges you in a fast paced environment a lot more like Starcraft.

2.0,True,"08 12, 2011",AJN24TVEGZEI4,B000935256,Steve,"Ok, so I bought Soul Calibur 3 after buying and absolutely disliking Soul Calibur 2, so therefore I guess it reasons that my disappointment with this game is my own fault.

First I am going to start off with the good aspects.  The game is beautifully crafted, the backgrounds are absolutely magnificent, the characters are beautifully developed and the graphics and frame rates are by all token beyond amazing.  When the characters are fight they are flawless, their moves, combat and actions are seamless and there is not a skip or a frame miss between them.  The backgrounds are much more developed than in SC2, and they even allow you to manipulate the scenery, for instance if a fighter hits a wall it will break ect.  Next the game is filled to the hilt with tons of extras, tons of mini games, and you are able to buy and absolute plethora of weapons, armor and items, almost mirroring the final fantasy series in a great way.  Lastly the music isn't bad and the story line is pretty good too although it an get convoluted at times.  Finally, I absolutely love that you can build your own character, but I hate that you are relegated to the weapons and moves that the dictator computer forces on you.

Now for the negatives which unfortunately far outweigh the positives.  As amazing and as wonderful as the above aspects are, they really don't make the game fun, and for me a video game needs to be fun for me to enjoy it, it needs to entertain me, not give me rage and frustrate my like this game does.  My contention with this game comes in the following areas.

(1) The games difficulty is absolutely ridiculous and is not made with common gamers in mind.  I am not serious about video games, I play them to pass the time or on my train commute, but this game is developed for serious gamers and this is clearly reflected in the lack of difficulty settings.  No, ""easy"" mode or ""medium"" for guys like me, only hard for the fan boys.

(2)The AI is completely unbalanced.  One stage is super easy, the next one is super hard, than followed by easy and so forth in a random order.  This is angering when I am getting my butt handed to me in the first stage because I got stuck against a genius AI.  At least with MK the game gets harder as you progress, and as you get better, this is completely random.  Also how the hell can a massive behomoth such as Asteroth deal tiny amounts of damage, but a little shrimpy girl like Taki can deal mass amounts of damage and over whelm you?  Yea, someone is a feminist!

(3)Like in SC2, the computer can pull of these ridiculous moves that you can not even dream of pulling off.  When you get stuck fighting against a hard AI, the computer will have you bouncing in the air for 6 or 7 hits with 3/4 of your life gone before you even know what happened to you.  The computer will block you every 20 seconds and you won't get a good hit in at all, and it will pull off a counter every 3 seconds as is the same with breaking your grabs, but you as the player can forget about any of that, the probability of you timing it right is 1/1,000,000.

(4) Who ever designed the characters, clearly had favorites in mind and was by all means close to being a feminist.  All of the female characters are far better than the male characters, are far faster, stronger, more elegant and the computer works their AI much better.  Also when fighting Mitsarugi's AI, he was clearly a favorite of the developers as his fighter wether it is your first or 10th fight is unbeatable and is insanely hard to beat.

(5) What the hell, they got rid of all of the great charatcter moves and replaced them with boring moves.  For instance, Ivy cant swing her sword/whip around any more with the L2 button, instead she just stabs.. BORING.. On the upside Taki has a good move where she stabs the ground, with L2 so i guess the got rid of great moves and added some good ones.. Leave the great ones and add more great ones! Also, some of the fighter's outfits are just plain dumb, I think they were better fashioned in SC2.  Asteroth looked better in SC2, as did Taki (I hate her mask).

(6) Chronicles of the sword is so dumb, childish and pointless.  I hated the weapon master in SC2 because of its difficulty, but this puts it to shame, makes me love WM.

(7) This game is all about practice.  If you have the time to practice and play for 8 hrs a day like a good fan boy should than you will have no problem mastering the moves and combos.  But if you are like me and you are getting a degree, working and conducting a personal life, you can forget about getting anywhere in the game.

(8) The memory card currupts if you save another game after playing Chron of the Sword.  This is kind of idiotic considering that I really don't feel like paying for 2 memory cards just to have an entire card for one game that genuinely dislike.

I gave this game an additional star becuase its good aspects are phenominal.  Unfortunately none of the good parts make the game enjoyable or fun.  This game is so hard and so frustrating that you will either put it down in a minute or you will toss your controller out the window in sheer rage.  If you have time to invest in practice and all that BS buy this game, but don't buy into the little fan boys and girls about how great this game is.  If you are like me and are a suckie,  casual gamer, this game is not for you, if you are a great gamer.. go for it.

2.0,False,"07 3, 2009",A2CAY12COAA2HD,B000ZK6950,Abram Taylor,"This is not a great game.  It's not even a good game -- just a solidly mediocre one.  And who has the time and money for mediocre games?  After the towering glory that was Resident Evil 4, I anticipated a nigh religious gaming experience, and that was what I should have gotten.  And yeah, before you get all ""you expect too much"" on me, I'll tell you this:  if you don't expect a *hellaciously* good time from entertainment software that runs fifty-to-sixty bucks a pop, you're either eating dodo sandwiches and blowing your nose on Franklins, or you're waaaaay too easy to please.

Okay, before I go into my grievances, here are some positives:  I like the basic zombie shooting, punching and kicking.  The two-player mode is a terrific thing to put in an RE game, and the ability to revive your dying partner if you reach him/her before he/she sinks to the ground is really cool and dramatic.  Firefights with gun-wielding soldier zombies later in the game are often fun -- I was surprised at that, actually.  The female characters are really cute, and it was good to see Jill Valentine again (though I don't like how they narrowed down the womanly hips she sported in the Gamecube Resident Evil remake).

Now my grievances:  Most of the maps are boring, confusing, and don't usually support the gameplay mechanics very well -- it seems like they're either too big or too small.  With the exception of one in which you help Jill out whilst avoiding an invincible Wesker, the boss battles are all phoned in, the big, wriggly snake beast encounters being some of the lamest.  All the characters are as *blaaah* as they come, personality-wise; they just say the same dumb, flat things over and over and over again, things like ""I should have killed you years ago, pesky, foolish hero!"" and ""Hey partner, we're partners to the very end, right partner?"" and ""What are you talking about villain?  You're mad, mad I say!""  It's alright to say stuff like that here and there in any action game (or movie, for that matter), but not all the rootin' tootin' time!  And why did they turn Chris into such a 'roid monster?  Sure, he was a big, tough guy in the other games, but jeeez!  And one last thing:  the African setting wasn't exploited to even near its full atmospheric potential (unlike RE4, which takes place in rural Spain and has European gothic fLaYvA to the MAX).

Don't tell me this game is at least as good as RE4, because it ain't.  I went back and immediately replayed it after beating RE5, and it is just so much better.

I really liked the art style, and from what I did play of this game some of it was interesting and/or funny, but I really didn't like the gameplay or most of the music.  The way you actually play (which is a bit hard to explain) is that there are colored in circles with numbers on them.  There are circles that go in towards the colored in circle and you have to tap the inner circle with the stylus with the outer circle hits it.  There are numbers on the circles and you have to tap them in order as the circles hit them.  Other times there may be a circle you have to hit at that time, but slide the stylus along the ball towards the end, and sometimes back again.  Other times you may have to hit the same circle twice if it has two circle lines going in towards it.  At the end of the level you have a circular disc that you have to spin around with the stylus.  The story and what's happening is on the top screen, while the agents dancing are on the bottom screen.  So, during play you don't really get to see what's happening on the top screen when you're playing because you have to pay attention to what you have to do, but before you start the next part you can look up and see whether you did well or not based on what happens and the circle that appears at the end saying you passed.  I remember that there are three sections of the song and story and you have to pass at least two to have beat the level.  Each part starts out with a comic book scene that you can choose to skip, but it's pretty slow and you can't really speed it up.

At the start there is a choice of what level to play it as, starting from easy.  I started with the next level above easy, but then had to go down to easy because the gameplay was just too hard.  After I started out on easy it wasn't too bad for a while, but it progressively got harder to the point where I was having difficulty keeping up or doing the right thing, so it's definitely a challenge to hit the right thing at the right time or slide the stylus along the balls, etc.  Sometimes it goes very fast.

As for the music, there were a few songs that I did like and it wasn't too bad playing during those songs, but for the other ones they were just really irritating and grating.  It seemed harder and more like a chore to get through.

1. These bugs include a very passive AI which often sits still while the player shoot arrow after arrow into the enemy army.

2. Laggy game for anyone that does not have a high performance machine even with graphic levels turned way down.

3. Pathfinding bug that has the AI walking back and forth during city assaults.

4. Several crash to desktop bugs

5. Overpowered agents particularly the inquisitors which seem to kill everything.

6. Not a challenging game with too many easy-to-exploit bugs.  The game in its current form is not much fun.

1. The graphics are better

2. The AI does seem to better in battle (when it isn't passive).

Once I started the game however I was sorely disappointed to find out the game only allows your character to move around via the ""Stylus"" and the d-pad works like the button pad.  I am all for implementing the use of the Stylus in DS games, but it should be an option...not a requirement.

Everything in this game just seems to take forever.  Moving with the stylus and only being to activate your tools with the buttons is just a pain. The character tires out quickly and is constantly having to forage for food.  The whole thing is just awkward to me and I lose interest in the game very quickly.  I played Zelda's Phantom Hourglass with the Stylus method of moving around, but in that game it just worked better.

IMO the biggest challenge about this game is using the controls while the game itself isn't very challenging.  A lot of features seem stripped out of the game and it's just kinda boring.  It doesn't even measure up to HM DS Cute.  I am sure some people will enjoy this game and possibly will not be bothered by the Stylus interface, but Natsume missed the mark for me.

Oh, you'll be taken in at first by the pretty graphics and immersive environments, and you will want to like it. You may notice some idiosyncrasies here and there: a save system that relies on save points that are few and far between, an almost entirely linear path from the starting point of the game to the end (i.e. there is literally one path from the first town to the third town, and travel between the two is time consuming and tedious), an inability to truly pause the game between enemy encounters.

If you're like me, though, you'll over look all of that -- at least until you get to an unexpected boss battle, and you're caught unprepared because all of the enemies in the area were incredibly easy to slaughter, and you didn't save at the last save point because of that fact, and the boss picks you off without difficulty, and you have lost an hour or more of tedious, repetitive work.

The promise of procedural  worlds and of flying to a planet and landing on it and exploring has been hanging over space sims for a while. This was supposed to be the one that really nailed procedural generation and made it possible to generate really interesting planets. It succeeds in that, for the most part. The planets could have more going on with topography, like canyons and more than one biome per planet but overall it succeeds in that.

Where it falls short is in giving you a reason keep exploring the planets beyond the upgrade this, upgrade that, get a better ship, get a better gun grind. I guess I was expecting more of a Minecraft in space thing where the combat took a back seat  while crafting different combinations of elements would get you really interesting and unexpected things that you could then use to build more things. Instead crafting is very linear, controlled with recipes that you acquire randomly from aliens and very little of it changes the gameplay in any appreciable way. At the same time, combat is fairly weak, with only  a couple of weapon options in hand and for your ship. What really takes it down for me though is that so much of the control of the ship is out of your hands. You literally cannot crash land because you can't get close to the ground. You can't go flying through alien canyons at breakneck speeds or use your ship's weapons to attack creatures and sentinels on the ground. Landing on the ground and docking in space stations is totally done by the machine. It's as if even the places where some accidental excitement might happen were smoothed over to keep them dull. Instead it seems that they tried to make the story the primary driving force but because the aliens you talk to are so very much the same, each at the same desk, down the same hallway in the same space station or in the same outpost, repeated a quintillion times, there's just not enough promise that you'll find some spectacular alien ruin or technology that will make any of it worth it.

First, here's what I can say I like about it:
The game looks fantastic.  It's quite obvious that QuanticDream spent a lot of man hours developing this game.  The characters are seemingly more life-like than most HD movies I've watched, and the atmospheres this game use really do add emotional depth to an otherwise shoe-strung story (see below).  Despite its flaws, I do like how your actions determine what ending you get.  Bioshock had this kind of an element, but in the end your choices didn't really make a huge difference aside from Trophies/Achievements.  In Heavy Rain, your choices determine far more than what trophies you take.  Games like that are far and in between, and that's where the two stars in this rating come from.  Production value and Interaction.  Also, the piece of paper that came with it to fold up was a neat way to spend time while waiting for the obnoxiously long install.

Otherwise, let me explain why I wish I just bought Battlefield 3 or something else:
Nevermind what your choices determine, the road to getting there is a short but tedious and boring one.  The game can be completed within a 12-hour time-frame, so if you actually DO like it and you feel like trying it all over again to change your ending, suit yourself.  This game is advertised as a taut psychological thriller, and yet I couldn't help but feel like I was spending 3/4 of the game doing menial tasks like brushing my teeth and opening doors (or figuring out how), not to mention all the times out of frustration I couldn't figure out how to, uh, NAVIGATE.  It's very important in these kinda games to give your character a way to walk EASILY.  The only way someone should be holding another button while walking is for either ""RUN"" or ""SHOOT.""  I need to hold a button to walk around, WHAT THE F***?!  Also, about the origami I mentioned earlier... it's too bad this didn't come with at least two more--that's probably the only ""replayable"" aspect of this game.

Other than that, it's unfortunate that this game probably won't get me squat for trade-in value when I bring it to my local game shop in the coming week.  What an utter disappointment.  Next time I want a psychological thriller, I'll browse through Netflix.  In the end, this game feels more like a tech demo that was pushed through as a full game to boost sales... I cannot help but feel like that's all it is.","Not completely terrible, but very disappointed.",1322352000,2,,

No matter how long I hold the power button down they will not turn on (and the red light showing that they were charging was on, it is no longer on as they are supposed to be fully charged.  Any help or advice would be appreciated (waiting to hear back from TB support).

So while they worked

Setup
I had these up and running in about 10 minutes. The transmitter connects via usb AND optical cable. I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ViewHD-SPDIF-TOSLINK-Digital-Optical-Audio-Switcher-3x1-with-Remote-Three-Inputs-to-One-Output/dp/B00G188Z7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ViewHD SPDIF | TOSLINK Digital Optical Audio Switcher 3x1 with Remote (Three Inputs to One Output)</a>&nbsp;so that I could have my soundbar and headset transmitter connected at the same time. Works great. There is only one audio optical out on the xbox one so you will  need something like this if you have multiple audio devices with optical usage.
The headset paired very easily and sound was working very quickly.
I updated the firmware later on and it took another 15 minutes as you have to download a TB program and then update them.

Wireless?
Absolutely wireless-yes! No connection to controller or console needed.

Comfortable?
I have worn these for about 3-4 hours straight without any discomfort. They are comfortable by my standards.

Sound
I am not an audiophile but I have owned other TB's in the past, and these have the best sound quality I have experienced in headset. Gunshots and explosions in COD AW sound great. I have never owned any other brand so I can't really compare to astros ect.
Now as others have said these don't get CRAZY loud. I probably have them at 75% loudness and it is very crisp and a good volume for me. If I put them all the way up it is too loud for me but honestly I expected them to get louder. I'll put it this way, it is too loud for me but it doesn't hurt my ears.
The presets work well as you can definitely tell the difference when surround is on and when it is not. There is gaming mode (with four different settings like shooter, sports, racing), movie mode (with horror, action, drama), and music (with dance, acoustic, stadium), and SS off.

Charge
I probably played 10-15 hours for the first drain. FYI they beeped twice letting me know that the battery was drained. THere is no capability to use batteries or a charging pack (which would have been nice).

Mic
So I wasn't exactly thrilled with the mic either. It has three settings for sensitivity on the headset. I found myself having to talk pretty loudly for it to pick up my voice even on the most sensitive setting and it didn't work on the least sensitive. It is nice that the mic pics up your voice and then you can hear it through the headset.
The mic does plug in or out so you don't have to walk around with a mic if you don't want too.

Noise cancellation
So I could hear outside noise with these on which is fine by me. I am sure if you had it on the loudest setting though, you would not hear much outside noise.

Different uses
You can use these for PC (mic doesnt work). I have not tried other uses yet but it does have headphone output as well.

So if these had continue to work I would give them 4.5 stars. Sound is very good, could be louder. Mic is a little finicky.",Worked great for the first charge....,1415491200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I knew about the terrible reviews and tried to wait for a cheaper price but couldn't resist at just under $40.

The graphics aren't as bad as some people and pro reviews led me to believe. They def aren't good but better than a game like Left 4 Dead. The lighting is good and unless you are inspecting the walls and looking for bad graphics they won't jump out at you most of the time.

The Alien AI also isn't as bad as the pro reviews led me to believe. Basically at range the Aliens jumped around moved from wall to wall and were generally tough to hit up close though is when they basically walk towards you. There were plenty of times though when I would be battling Aliens and one or two would pop up out of the floor behind me or out of the ceiling. Of course there were times when they would crawl by you or get stuck in a wall something like that.

The pulse rifle sound is good and there is decent customization.

My issues with the game are there are long sections when you fight people. This was prob the most annoying part of the gameplay as early as I think Chap 2 you are fighting people. This is an Aliens game and i'd say its 50/50 the levels and battles against people and Aliens and that is a major mistake by the developers.

Ok now to the story which before release was touted as cannon in the Aliens series. My god I hope it isn't cause the story for this game is horrible, and makes the AVP movies in terms of story look like the Godfather. There is a ton of stuff at the end that makes no sense and isn't explained at all and while the cut scene graphics are OK most of the time in the game there is a cameo at the end that has one of the worst character renders and laughable graphics I have ever seen. I am not kidding as a fan of the films the story was insulting that they would try and pass it off on me.

That jubilation soon turned to ""I can't believe I wasted almost two months on this lackluster piece of garbage, hoping the game would pick up."" Let's go over the pros and cons of this latest installment.

Pros:

-You can turn off the battle voices or voice acting during scenes (always a plus.  Oh, Sophia, Roger...how I hate thee.)

-Nice visuals

-Decent voice acting, although many voices don't fit the characters and a few are...rotten apples (Welch Vineyard, anyone?)

-No random battles

Cons:

-Allies aren't too bright in battle.  The have a habit of standing in front of enemies and GET SOME (get killed)

-Poor battle system

-Characters can die if their MP OR HP drops to zero

-Enemies will be brutal in one dungeon, and weak in the next

-Shallow characters (for the most part)

-Weak story with a plot twist so inane, I can almost definitively guarantee you WILL return your copy to Amazon.com in a complex mixture of shock, humor, and disbelief.  It's that mind bogglingly BAD!

-No TRADITIONAL Private Actions (this means nothing to those who have never played this series)

-Item Creation system that will have you tearing out your hair in frustration. Nothing at all like the previous games! This feature eats more out of your pocket than the Federal Income tax, and the success rate of creating an item, even though certain characters have an aptitude for a particular craft is around 30%! To top that off, the ""loading screen"" whenever the characters are attempting to create an item takes an eternity compared to the more time efficient item creation of Star Ocean 2!

-Lots of backtracking. I mean LOTS of backtracking! There is so much back tracking in this game, Henry Townsend of Silent Hill 4 would cringe!

In short, this game is dull and uninspired. CSPAN plays this game to fall asleep! For those of you looking to get INTO the Star Ocean series, this game will definitely turn you OFF. Avoid this one!

2.0,False,"10 25, 2017",A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B01GKB3YB4,commorancy,"Deep Silver tries here, I'll give them that. They try hard, perhaps a little too hard. Let's get into the meat of this review.

Everything I liked about Saint's Row and Gatt out of Hell is entirely missing in this game. The open world is there, sort of. Unfortunately, it's not really an open world sandbox in the truest sense of the word. Sure, you can roam the city in between missions, but other than picking up crystal shards, repeating the same LEGION skirmishes over and over and racing, there's truly nothing else to do. Deep Silver / Volition did keep what seems to be the mission engine from Saints Row 3, but ditched pretty much everything else. I actually liked the superhero aspect of Saint's Row 3, but that was completely stripped from this game. Granted, I haven't unlocked every character yet, but so far I'm not really liking the characters in this game.

Yes, the characters are crazy, looney and Saturday morning cartooney, but they're really not very much fun to play. I preferred the loose style of street recruiting in SR3, the satire, the guns and the outright gang craziness, but that's no where to be found in Agents of Mayhem. In fact, the game is somewhat misnamed as there's very little Mayhem to be had. Mayhem mode in SR3 was trying to destroy as much stuff as possible for money. We don't even get that here. Instead, we get linear missions in pretty much the same underground lair each and every time. The bosses are predictable and while not horribly easy if you try to head-on them, you can get through it with enough time.

Worse, the missions are entirely repetitive using the same dungeon maps over and over. For example, I played the same starting mission at least 3 times in a row before making progress to later missions. I even had to come back and play this mission again later. Not sure what's going on there, but playing the same exact mission over multiple times was not at all fun. I expect repetition in at least some ways in most games, but this was entirely ridiculous. When you do get to the missions, they are either ridiculously hard or ridiculously easy and that entirely depends on how the scenario plays out. For example, one mission I played through, I ended up burning through all 3 of my agents in a minute or two and had to restart the mission. On the second play through (no difficulty level changes), I was able to get through it with one agent in less than 3 minutes. The primary difference was that I was able to use the character's special ability (lb + rb). When the ability chooses to appear seems to be random.

The story ideas are completely forced humor. Meaning, I've only gotten a few chuckles out of the game so far. Though, there was one concept that I entirely liked. Most battles in most games have you run around killing enemies with music and sound effects. However, in this game, when you're out killing LEGION troops, there's a whole separate voice-over narrative running discussing some random thing. These are the few times where I actually chuckled while playing the game. Not only did it take the repetition out of the mission, it allowed you to focus on the voice-over narrative (and jokes) while running around finishing that mission. I really liked this part of the game. This is something that Volition could use as the basis of a new set of games.

Overall, the game is basically Saint's Row 4 completely dumbed down to the point where it's neither fun to play nor funny. The creation of stereotypes that make up the Agents is completely overdone and cliche. The randomness in only allowing 3 agents at a time (when they can switch out randomly) seems to be a miss. If we have 10 agents, then let us cycle through all 10. Why restrict it to 3? Also, unlike SR4 where you could pickup and collect vehicles, you can't do that here. You're limited to unlocking vehicles and even then that's limited. Whatever is on the street is available for limited use, except you can't jack the bad guys vehicles?

Just not impressed by this game. I was hoping for more, but it's really not very much fun to play considering the sameness to the dungeons (lairs). The actual cartoon segments are way out of place next to the 3D environments and the really low frame rate for the cartoons is highly annoying. It kinda feels like I'm playing a game intermixed by a Saturday morning cartoon that's all flash and no substance. I'm giving this game 2 stars. One for trying and one for building a decent city. The missing stars are for the lackluster characters, the lame missions, the way overuse of the same dungeon layouts and the lack of being able to use that open city in a more sandbox kind of way. At least give us one character we can customize. If they had kept more of the feel of Saint's Row here (like the Dubstep gun, character customization and full jacking of cars and customization of them), I would have given more stars.","All flash, little substance",1508889600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

First of all, the cartridge slots are wider than the cartridges themselves so you gotta be careful when putting them in or you may damage the circuit.  Also, the slots are tight so putting them in & taking them out can be a bit off putting.  The NES slot is also a bit wobbly.  I've had to take out & reput cartridge in it to get it to work sometimes.

Second, the NES audio is really bad.  I dunno if my system has a bad audio circuit for NES games or what, but it is constantly making light popping noises & sometimes garbled audio.  The audio for SNES/Genesis is fine, though.  I can barely tell the difference.

Thirdly, the controller & console feel cheap.  The system is super light, so when you try to pull out a cartridge if you don't hold it down you'll pick up the system along with it.  If you accidentally tug on the controller you may also pull the console down.

Overall, it's an okay system.  It's a space saver for me, as I don't have room for a NES. SNES and Genesis in my gaming area.  Just wish it had more quality put into it.  I'll update my review if anything changes.

As a fan of strategy games, I loved the fact that you had so many different units, weapons and armor to choose from, and I loved the fact that you could play as so many different characters in Heroes.

I downloaded the Circle of Doom demo off the XBox 360 marketplace, mostly because I was SOMEHOW hoping that, despite all the bad publicity and reviews the game has gotten, it would be a good game.

Boy, was I wrong.

To start, what happened to the strategy elements? That was the main point of the first two games, so why take it out of this second one?

Secondly, when did the game reduce itself to pure hack-and-slash-styled gameplay? I compare it to Dynasty Warriors for that reason (though I WILL say that Koei's Dynasty Warriors franchise is LEAGUES ahead of this game.)

To give you a rundown on the gameplay, it's like this: You start out by playing as one of the main characters, then engage in a tutorial mode after a cutscene (which I skipped, because I could barely hear the characters talking, as well as the fact that the voice acting sounded horribly lazy.) This tutorial mode teaches you how to fight (not very well at that.) You use the A and X buttons to wield your weapon(s), as well as the B and Right Button (don't confuse the button with the trigger) to use your magic. The first thing I noticed was how slow the response times were. Another thing I noticed was that, when holding the right button (as it tells you to do to use one of your special abilities,) it didn't always respond. You end up clicking or holding the button.

Another thing: The combat. When I engaged in battle with a few simple enemies, I found a fourth of my health knocked down based on the pure fact that I couldn't attack them fast enough (The Crusaders and Heroes' respond times were MUCH better and faster.) I don't recall there ever being a block button (which was in the previous two games.)

Added to this slow combat, movement is also slow. I can understand that the characters are carrying a good amount of weaponry and armor, but that gives them no excuse to move like snails. (The only excuse for that would be if they were carrying a hammer or some other weapon, which my character--Leinheart--wasn't.)

Finally, the map has you following a set path. In The Crusaders and Heroes, the map was free roam--meaning you could go ANYWHERE you wanted. In this game, you are stuck to a set path, which makes moving frustrating (and even more tedious.)

They're trying to pass the game off as an RPG, but the only RPG elements I see is the story (which doesn't seem all that good, considering you can't even enjoy the voice acting) and the weapon/armor customization (which there is hardly any.)

I didn't try the co-op mode, but I didn't plan on playing more of this horrible game. I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't buy the fourth installment based on the fact that this one was so bad.

The only reason I gave the game two stars was because... well, I played it for ten minutes, and enjoyed that small amount of time I played it (though I had no intention to play it further.)

One final note: I see that CoD was made by Blue Side and The Crusaders and Heroes were made by Phantagram, which is an obvious indicator as to why the gameplay (and everything, for that matter) is so different. I CANNOT, however, fathom why Phantagram would entrust a different company with their series. Seeing how CoD turned out, I hope they reconsider giving another company a right to make another game in one of their series.

If you plan on playing the Kingdom Under Fire series, skip CoD and play The Crusaders and Heroes (in that order)--you won't be disappointed in either of the two.",Feels like a dumbed-down version of Dynasty Warriors,1236124800,4,,

As somebody who grew up with the cheesy 80's cartoon show, had boxes of the action figures, and owned just about any Turtles game he could get his hands on I was elated when the Turltes got a new series several years ago.  I bought the games for that, which were pretty darned good.  Probably the only one I missed was Mutant Melee.  I even picked up the fairly decent TMNT movie based game for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PC/dp/B000MRAZ3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PC</a>&nbsp;and for the Gameboy Advance.  I have a Michelangelo figure from a Happy Meal sitting on my desk right now.  I AM A FAN!

Now take 25 years worth of material, dozens of characters from the series, a beautiful promo video, and a developer that has made some truly incredible games in the past and...it's mostly squandered.  Playing the game for just a few minutes will leave you saying ""This is it?""  In story mode, you have the four turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, and Splinter.  That's it.  Splinter is hosting a tournament to see which of them is the strongest.  You don't even fight everybody before you're suddenly declared the winner, but the Fugitoid has been captured by Shredder so you'll have to go fight the foot.  It literally took me 15 minutes to beat the game on my first try.  You get a short unique ending for each of the characters.  They didn't bother to change video in the middle, so if you're playing as Splinter you still congratulate the Turtles on winning.

Characters all pretty much fight the same with minor differences.  It's mostly just mashing the weak or strong attack button, throwing, blocking, and using power-ups.  I think the game is mostly designed as a party game for a group of people who may not be able/willing to learn complex fighter controls; if you have 4 people willing to play and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-2-Multitap/dp/B00066LGEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 2 Multitap</a>&nbsp;you could probably have a lot of fun with it.  I do hear it's got some glitches occasionally marking the wrong player as the winner, but if you're playing with friends who cares?

You can unlock the characters to use in VS battles (Shredder, Karai, Foot Soldier, a Utrom, and Raph as Nightwatcher), though not in the story mode.  If you're expecting tons of characters from either of the cartoons, you'll be disappointed.  No Bebop.  No Rocksteady.  No Rat King.  No Rock soldiers, Foot-tech ninjas, or giant mousers.  Not even a Triceraton makes an appearance.  It's truly inexplicable why they left out so many possible choices.  With simplified controls and no custom backgrounds for them it's not like they didn't have room on the disk to include a lot more.  I'd have rated this game MUCH higher if only for another five characters and a few more battlegrounds.

In the Wii version you can unlock Fugitoid (anybody care?) and three Rabbids from the Rayman series (for some reason?) and a really cool Technodrome stage. Nobody's review tells you this, but that was all cut in the PS2 version!  I've tried the codes, unlocked all the missions, and you don't get any more than 12 total characters.  The Ubisoft website still highlights slots for 20 characters, but even the Wii version only has 16.  I know I'll never pre-order any Ubisoft stuff again.

Battlegrounds are well designed and many have hazards to use and avoid.  For example some levels you can toss enemies off the roof to their death, while others have breakable objects or floors.  There are even a couple like the train level where you have to keep progressing forward as the screen moves or you can fall off and die.  The levels are well designed.  The only one I didn't like was an especially flashy level with explosions going off which made it kind of hard to see my character to continue the fight.

To sum things up, if this is meant as a party game for you and some friends then it'd be a great rental that you could have hours of fun with.  If you're getting this to play a true Ninja Turtles fighting game, it's probably one to skip.  From the lack of content, the limited number of unlockables, and the comic book style animation (which just happens to be much cheaper to animate...) it just doesn't feel like any real effort went into creating this thing.

Once you get it to run, well, its another skanky console port.  I can live with the 3rd person view, thats not too bad.  But the controls are so clunky, you simply cannot get anywhere.  Also, there is a quick save that does NOT work (it says, ""quick save failed"" 90% of the time).  Turns out, you CANNOT save during a firefight, which is the only time most people WANT to save.  Dumb, just dumb.

As far as game play, its a mixed bag.  The story line is so so, seems like a mishmash of Doom3/Halo2/Advent Rising/et al rehashed at some level, but its decent.  Voice acting is above par as well.  However, the weapons simply suck, as they take 30 seconds to recharge (while you get killed), and the whole ""level up"" thing makes no sense so you can't seem to get anywhere.  Also, in the grand tradition of console games, the action does things for you, like take cover, or make dumb decisions for you about where you stand (and get stuck).  Its that thing that made Gears of War frustrating on the PC, and its here yet again.  I find myself mashed against a wall, when I didn't want to be there.  Aiming is also assisted, and it makes absolutely ZERO sense most of the time, especially because you cannot hit anything anyway

Also, using the scope on the assault rifle shakes so much, you cannot hit a thing.  In many games, there is a breath/calm/stabilize function for scope use, or you can crouch to steady the scope, but not here.  Totally useless 80% of the time.  What were they thinking

It has an inventory system, that basically makes no sense, and the pamphlet that comes with it seems to be an even dumber downed version of the console version, with less information.

Some folks are talking about the grainy look to it, but that can be switched off in the options menu by de-selecting the ""film grain"" look button (why any game developer would waste their time with this whole thing is beyond me)

All in all, its another half baked console port.  We are all tiring of them to be honest, as one can tell by the zillions of harsh and painful reviews for console ports.  The developers just drop the ball nearly 100% of the time for whatever reason.

I don't mind many of the console action cues, or some of the basic control crossovers, but when there is ZERO effort put into making the PC versions work like a PC version can, its a huge letdown (just see the bloody aweful Lost Planet for the PC, nearly unplayable)  Mass Effect is not a total dud port, but what was delivered to us is a major letdown, as the developer touted how much PC focus was going to go into the game.  Oh well, another $50 down the drain

ADDED MORE 6/6/2008

I have tried to like this game.  But alas, it was not meant to be.  The designers simply were not thinking.  Each firefight is painfully slow and repetitive.  You cannot hit a thing, the weapons do not work, you cannot really hide, jump, or any evasive maneuvers.  The story is very VERY verbose, which is ok I guess, but you have to hear it over and over and over again because it always comes before a firefight, and you cannot save during the talking or shooting, so you have to listen over and over and over.  Simply atrocious.

Bioware knows they have an issue here, and they are deleting posts from their forums where people complain, and basically pretending nothing is wrong, which makes matters worse.

I tried, but failed to let this game grow on me.  It is another example of the ""professional reviewers"" giving high scores to games of advertisers, where the game does not even come close.  Crysis was another trainwreck like this, where players hated it, and reviewers said it was the next coming of the messiah.  Uhuh","What a disappointment.

THis got me very excited about languages, and I decided I really wanted to learn Spanish.  I thought this Spanish coach would be a great place to start.  And I have to say, for the first 50 lessons, it is a fun and effective way to get into the language.  However, after the first 50 lessons (they take maybe 8 hours to complete and to really feel like you've learned everything in them), the game goes into what it calls the ""Open Lessons"").  This is how it works:

Starting with lesson 51, you get 10 words per lesson to ""master.""  You get no phrases, no conjugations, NO GRAMMAR.  The words are seemingly chosen at random, though they are set in the game in that order, so you can't change it.  I went through about 15 of these ""Open Lessons"" (there are I think 1,000 in the end!), and found them to be utterly ridiculous.  Instead of learning useful vocabulary like ""bird,"" you learn the word for ""ORIOLE.""  Instead of ""to say,"" you learn ""to utter.""  Things like that.  Essentially, you learn words that are not used in every day language.  I kept doing the next lesson, certain that things would level out, but each lesson I was presented with words that I can't even imagine using even in English.

It definitely feels less like a toy than its competition.  However, performance is ultimately what matters and in this realm, it falls short.

Both the strum bar and the fret buttons feel radically different from the GH controller.  After using both for a while, the GH controller lends itself to better accuracy and higher scores.  The strum bar on the RB guitar is free-floating, i.e. there is no clicking into place with each strum.  I find that the clicking provides your strum hand with necessary feedback on when a note has been registered.  You'll miss a few here and there on the RB guitar as a result.  But the real crime is the fret buttons.  They're nicely-sized, covering the entire fret, so I expected the RB guitar to shine here.  However, they actually do click (and click hard) into and out of place with each press.  Plus, the plastic is strangely sticky compared to the much slicker buttons on the GH controller.  All of this combines into more difficult gameplay, which makes the RB controller less useful and fun to play.

The RB guitar adds some bells-and-whistles functionality like an effects switch and high fret buttons, but they're just unnecessary gimmicks.  Each of the effects just make your playing sound bizarre because their depth is way too deep.  The high fret buttons can be used to solo with one hand (i.e. no strumming necessary), but it's more of a hassle than it initially sounds.  The buttons are awkward to reach, it's difficult to move from the lower to the higher button sets on faster songs that transition quickly to/from the solos, and ultimately, it diminishes the feel and fun of actually playing guitar.

Much like the drum kit for Rock Band, this peripheral needed a little more time on the design table.  Rock Band may be the superior game, but the instrument controllers just aren't up to par.

PROS

*  Unibody construction has a good, solid feel compared to the detachable neck of the GH guitar
*  Large, full-fret buttons

CONS

*  Sticky/clicky buttons coupled with floating strumbar greatly diminish gameplay performance

I truly felt like I was wasting precious moments of my life that I'd never see again.  For whatever reason, Capcom has decided to structure their games around co-op gameplay.  Now, co-op is fantastic as an option, but when it is the basis of the entire game it seems to take away from the campaign experience - especially that of 1-player.  Capcom has done this with other titles with the same effect (REF Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City).  So, for starters, if you are looking for a one player action/adventure/shooter campaign you should probably pass this game up.  In fact, if you are looking for any entertainment whatsoever you should probably pass this game up.  Aside from the fairly decent visuals and relatively well done ambient audio, there is little to brag about with this title.  Enemies are recycled ad-nauseum - even though you'll enounter different types of creatures, they all seem to be based on the same model.  This makes the enemies seem repetitive.  The characters are dressed in ridiculous looking outfits.  Customization of your character is allowed, but very limited.  No matter how you tweak the outfit, you still end up looking like a douche with a propeller for a backpack.  There is also the addition of an ""anchor"", which is sort of an extendable gripping mechanism ala Bionic Commando.  It's used for climbing small hills and it's pretty much useless after that.  Do yourself a favor and save your money.  Unless the price point falls under $10 or a friend loans it to you or you find it in a donation bin somewhere, pass it up.

I know I wasn't going to expect Madden or the fast pace even of a ""Dawn of War"" during the Blitz mode of this game.  Unfortunately, I find this game somewhat lacking and slow...yes readers, even slower than a tabletop game of Blood Bowl.  I get the turn based mode, which is very true to the tabletop version, but even then it seems to chug slowly uphill in comparison.

Pros:  - True to the tabletop in the ""classic"" mode in terms of rules
  - 8 teams to choose from (this is good and bad...good for the diversity, bad because the tabletop has 15 teams)

Cons: - The game seems somewhat slow
  - Graphics are Xbox quality, NOT 360
  - ""Tutorial"" mode is a complete joke and basically useless, could've been better thought out
  - The commentators SUCK, as in the worst I've heard in ANY game...I pretty much tune them out...at times I forget there even are any, that's how innane and worthless they are
  - There are constant grammatical and spelling errors...SERIOUSLY!  Did they not edit this???
  - Since the tutorial is so pathetic it's easy to get lost early on...the learning curve is pretty bad.  If you have the tabletop version, the rules are actually the same...reading this will go farther than just the manual.  (e.g. Ok, so fouling can get a player kicked off the field...the manual says it can, not why, while the tabletop guide says why and how)
  - Each turn has a time limit...when I pressed the XBOX GUIDE button to pause the game, i noticed the clock in the background still ticking down!  Really???  Yes, there is a pause button, but by going to the GUIDE, it should automatically pause like any other game.
  - You can't change team colors.  Yes, I know, this isn't Madden, but some more team customization would've been nice, since the tabletop allows you to design a team from scratch.  I'm surprised some of this element didn't carry over.

So, overall, if you're a tabletop fan with no one to play with, this is a way to play on your own or online, albeit with issues.  I really did want to like this game and was excited, but I honestly feel let down, even at the $49 pricetag.

Also, instead of loading our saved game after the last time it froze up, I went directly into the minigames and was able to play that for about 70 WHOLE MINUTES with no crashes.

The biggest issue is the horribly, horribly stupid AI.  It'll blow through all your precious TP (mana) as fast as possible even if that's a complete waste.

Some people say, ""well just turn off ability usage.""  Then you're creating another problem: characters that just stand there or move back and forth in combat without contributing anything.  They also tend not to auto attack when they should (like a medic) or stay in melee when they shouldn't (like a runemaster).

I still do like the gameplay in general, much more than the other Etrian games though, so it might be worth it for that.  Many people try soloing the game just to avoid the AI, so that's another route to take.",Bad AI,1486512000,,,

I found myself in the first camp as I anticipated what I thought would be a badass entry in my favorite series of games.  With Nintendo promising a more intricate overworld filled with puzzles that seamlessly flowed into dungeons, my mind raced, believing that the era of easy Zeldas designed with kids in mind was over.  What I got instead was a 40 hour fetchquest.

I'll probably spoil some stuff so watch it.

Also, I got the version with the bundled controller.
The controller is nice, and not as fingerprint hungry as the others.

Enemies in General:
I'll be very blunt. There's about 4 enemies that you'll actually ""fight"" throughout the game. Bokoblins, Moblins, Stalfos, and Lizalfos.  They each come with different ""versions"" of themselves, basically reskinned and using a different weapon, for example the regular Lizalfos and the Dark Lizalfos. Regular ones shoot fire, Dark ones shoot ""cursed breath"" which induces the curse status, new to zelda, which leaves you unable to use weapons/items.  That's about it, aside from the bosses.  Combat is basically finding the obvious weakspot, hitting there, waiting for the enemy to move around aimlessly for a bit, opening the weakspot again, and striking again.  All other enemies are ohko.  But seriously, 70% of what you fight is just bokoblins, with moblins coming in around 7/8th's the way through the game. Every single Lizalfos I fought dropped a tail, and I have 12 of them. Not very many of those in comparison with the rest of the game.  There's beamos here and there, deku babas, and keese too.

Dungeons and Bosses:
The bosses are pretty fun. You fight Ghirahim three times throughout, the second fight being the most fun.  This fact makes it so that there are less bosses overall, however, as he is the boss of the first and sixth dungeon.  The fourth boss is very very fun, throwing attacks at you and continually getting back up to wreck you.  The fifth boss and fifth dungeon are probably the best in the game with the boss and the setting leading up to and during the fight being really great and immersive.  The boss is a giant Kraken thing with one eye. The dungeon is actually a ship, and once you finish the dungeon and prepare for the boss, it starts to rumble. Giant tentacles begin to tear through the entire ship, leading you back up to the deck.  As I said, this makes for a really cool moment that immerses you completely within the game.  The seventh (and final) dungeon has no boss battle.  The seventh dungeon is however one of the more difficult parts of the game, and it is very enjoyable.  The final boss is absolutely pathetic.

The first three dungeons were beyond easy.  Getting inside them was tougher than the actual dungeons.  And getting inside them was basically just, dowse, dowse, dowse, ok now you have gathered X amount of things you need in order to get inside the dungeon which was extremely annoying. Dowsing has you basically moving around your sword in first person mode trying to pinpoint the location of something. Dowsing was originally showcased as a replacement to the compass, but you can't dowse inside dungeons. This continues to a lesser extent later on, but basically instead of exploring the game makes you waste time doing this.  There is not much to explore anyways, since the areas are extremely linear, as is the whole game.

As an example, in the first area which is the woods, you have to find a bunch of Kikwis, which are the little tanooki looking creatures.  When you find them all, you go back to their boss which gives you the slingshot, which is required to enter the first dungeon.  Standard fare, but your first time doing this will undoubtedly take you longer than it should. It isn't as seamless as they said.  When they said that, I imagined the world suddenly takes you through an area and you find a chest with a key inside and you realize, woah, I'm in dungeon! I thought I was still just outside! Nope.

Controls and Items:
I found that in trying to strike quickly, the control would often flip out and do the wrong thing.  For example, if an enemy has an opening that calls for you to strike in a downward and to the right position, and you try to quickly do this motion, more than likely you won't be hitting it correctly, resulting in the enemy parrying or your attack bouncing off and then getting hit, as you leave yourself open.  This was with the actual control that game with the game, not a wii remote + attachment.  When done in a slow motion, it is accurate. So you have to wave gently in order to perform an attack. Doesn't really feel like I'm attacking something.  1:1? I don't think Nintendo knows what that means.  Additionally, it is laggy. It will not perform the movement the instant you do it unless you're moving slowly.  I tested this between 60Hz and 120Hz, and it was definitely worse on the 60Hz (obviously).

Flying and swimming are handled in the same manner, by holding the wii remote horizontally and adjusting direction by tilting and twisting.  Some may like this, some may not.  I enjoyed flying and swimming, but it became a bit cumbersome with the laggy response time.

The shield mechanic is pretty solid.  You use the nunchuk to throw up your shield to reflect attacks, which normally gives you the chance to counterattack.  If you fail to perform it correctly though, it takes a chunk out of your shield's ""life bar"" which eventually leads to it breaking.  The shield can be upgraded, but it is sort of pointless seeing as you get the chance to buy an improved shield every time you feel like upgrading it.

Your other items work pretty spot on, even allowing you to recenter the aim with a press of down on the D-PAD. They all felt good to use, even though they didn't get too much use aside from the beetle.  The Bow and Arrows are the last item you get making it a bit strange that you can't use them to fight much through out the game.  I hardly used anything but the sword as a fighting weapon where as in previous zelda games I'd use almost everything but the sword.  The items are more spread out as well.  Items that we saw like the digging mitts are only useable in specific areas and are not assigned to your item wheel, but instead an equipped item, like a tunic would have been equipped in Ocarina of Time.  Your shield and bottles and nonessential items are stored in a secondary item wheel.  This can be seen as useful or not.  This is just a matter of personal opinion as I'm sure not everyone liked the huge item wheel from Twilight Princess.  This secondary item wheel can only carry four items initially, and must be upgraded by buying more pouches from Beedle in a majorly escalating price point.  The bomb bag and arrow quiver cannot be upgraded, but instead you can buy additional bags or quivers which hold an extra 5 units a piece.  These must go in your secondary item wheel, which can dissuade you from wanting them in the first place.  The game never leaves you without a patch of bomb flowers if you need them or without arrows if you cut the grass.  This same mechanic applies to the ignored slingshot.

Plot:
The majority of the time, when you get to an interesting plot point, you have to begin another fetch quest.  The biggest of these is

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

the forging of the Master Sword.  This negative point can be attributed to simple fanboy nerdrage, but let's examine it anyways.  In prior Zelda games it is said that the Master Sword is a relic of the ancient Hylians, forged by sages as the blade of evil's bane.  In this game, it is originally called the Goddess Sword, that the goddess Hylia creates in an intricate plot to destroy the game's main villain who gets mentioned about once throughout the game until the very end.  Link has to, in a similar fashion to the also not very good Phantom Hourglass, gather 3 of something in order to turn the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword.  Once you do create it, you get an anti climatic ""MASTER LINK, YOU NOW HOLD THE MASTER SWORD."" from Fi.  The creation of the Master Sword is retconned, and it is made in a way copied from PH.  Cool. Not. This also implies that the people in skyloft are not the Hylians in question from before, as there were people on the surface prior to them.

The game also does not explain anything about the hylian crest (the red bird and the triforce) that is present on the shields.  You get the Hylian Shield in the game, with no mention of Hyrule or anything of the sort, but you see the emblem sans the head of the bird and the triforce all over the place though.

As for characters, I didn't delve too deeply into the sidequests as I wasn't expecting a second helping of Majora's Mask. The game lets you court several of the female NPC's apparently though. Tsk tsk, cheating on zelda? Shame on you.  You get the standard serving of Zelda people with repeated dialogue and grunts with some comedy here and there, (mostly from Groose).

Conclusion:
Yes, I understand that all Zelda is is basically a fetchquest.  Going through three dungeons to get the Master Sword is nothing new.
Going through three dungeons to FORGE the Master Sword is a problem, to me anyway.
I can't really continue with this as it's basically all that needs to be said about this game.
Is it worth the money?  Not really.  From what I've seen people are split and either love it or dislike it.
The game's length is artificially extended.
I'll probably get flamed for writing a negative review of it, but people, I've been making bacon bits out of Ganon since I was four.
For me, this is the Other M of the Zelda series and a sign that maybe Nintendo isn't going to be pumping out stuff like it used to.

Maybe Groose was right. Maybe it should have been called ""The Legend of Groose.""",Skyward Sword. Eh.,1322179200,28,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Dark Knight was the reason I picked this up, I wasn't happy that it was a tank class instead of a DPS class but I pursued it anyway. I made it to level 60, I did the end game, I was not impressed with at all.

I have given this game countless attempts on the hopes that it would one day live up to the predecessor FF11, in before a bunch of rants about how it is a different game. This game was supposed to be the successor to 11, however so many people complained about certain things that made FF11, well.... FF11, that SE changed their direction of the game and it became A.R.R.
This game, like so many other MMO's out right now, is a WoW clone. No way around that, you can simply google ""ffxiv & wow,"" and you will be bombarded on millions of comparison websites between the two.

The game itself was way easier than people think, I even tried to challenge myself and go into new dungeons/raids without once researching them as a player, much less a tank role. I would tell people I was new but watched the video, the only time I ever lost a battle was because the healer jumped off the map during Bismark fight. Everything else was a win on the first round.

The jobs aren't that in depth, nothing really has a different feel about them, yes drk can hold tp forever and just manage mp, while pld runs out of tp and holds mp all day. All the class roles seem the same with new skins and no real need to be skillful at anything just play a game of simon says and click the next blinking box for the combo. As a tank open up with some enmity gain actions and rest of the fight is DPS with occasional AoE Enmity gain, never lose hate.

I have been waiting patiently since I heard of this games release. I've played the other two in the series and I really enjoyed them. The first was amazing the second one was good and this one is just...boring.
Lets start with the presentation. The models, in my opinion are gross, rigid and flat. I don't mind the new design choice but the results of it are not good. The music as far as I know is just rehased from the first two. I quite enjoyed the music in the first two games but I thought this game would have an original score. The audio is unbalanced. Zero is low and muffled while everyone else varies between too loud and hard to hear.
The story didn't grab my attention in the slightest. I knew it was going to be the same song and dance but I was hoping for a flowchart. The fact that you can play any story in any order gives this sense of freedom until you have no idea what connects and what's going on. I liked the previous games because I could connect with the characters. I was playing as one main character getting to know the others on a somewhat personal level. Switching between 3 different teams of 3 different people and then having exposition shoved into my face(lazily I might add) doesn't hold my attention. At times I would put my 3ds down and just start scrolling through my phone half pay attention.
I think the reason I'm so upset with this is because I have waited years. I bought the second game the moment it came out and couldn't wait for the last to wrap up the story. I was hoping for answers and something really cool. But I just got a game that doesn't live up to the predecessors in the slightest.
I do have to give the game credit though, the puzzles were interesting and some of the dialogue was funny. The deaths I think we're the highlight but I more enjoyed the descriptions in the first two. It left more of an impression on me simply because I could close my eyes and visualize, as one is supposed to do in a visual novel.

(I was using keyboard and a corded, optical mouse)  When serving you would click W,A,S, or D to start serve, then watch a power scale and try to click again when it was at maximum.  That part was o.k.  The problem was with returns.  First you would move the mouse to where the ball was hit toward.  Then you would hit W,A,S, or D for your swing type selection, (holding it down for more power and precision), then move the mouse forward, backward, left, right, or diagonally to aim your shot.  Mind you, this is all in the fraction of a second that it takes for the ball to reach your side of the court.  The easiest option was to use the S key for a safe shot.  That shot would always stay in bounds.  Of course you still had to get to the correct location in time which wasn't always easy.  Even if you hit 10-15 safe returns in a row your opponent (even low level players) would 95% of the time match you shot for shot until you got caught out of position and missed.  To have a better chance of scoring you had to use a ""risk"" shot.  For those you would again use the mouse to get into position, then press and hold the spacebar, press W,A,S, or D (which now brought up a meter to watch) and hold till the indicator was in the top position.  (it moves very fast)  Oh, and as mentioned before, once you pressed your shot selection button the mouse now switches from moving the character to aiming your shot.  In all I played about 120 games and was able to win only 2 times!

  The time to uninstall the game was the longest I ever encountered.  It made me wonder what it was doing.

In summary I could not recommend this game to anyone except the very best players.  The controls are just way too difficult for average, casual gamers.  (at least with a mouse and keyboard)",Top Spin 2 - not for casual gamers,1331424000,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

In order to play this program you are required to join Ubisofts ""Game Launcher.""  The launcher is cumbersome and it is difficult to create the initial account.  While the game works well once the game launcher is set-up, the load times and scene changes are very slow.  Being required to play under any domain launcher is the #1 game buster for me.

You can not play this game if you are not connected to the internet, which for me isgame buster #2, as I am often without access to the net.  I have not found a way to ""opt out"" of the on-line award and achievement knick-knacks, which to me are an unnecessary annoyance.  My goal when playing a computer game, is to have it install, load and run, simply and efficiently.  That is not the case with Silent Hunter 5.

Once in game the graphics are equal to or above the previous games and moving between stations via keyboard and mouse is simple and direct.  This is the first Silent Hunter game in which your character can move freely throughout the boat.  While its interesting, it does not add anything to the game play.

You can visit with the various officers and their chat window gives you options to have a slightly more personal conversation.  I like that aspect and wish it had been further developed.  There are options available in which you, as the Captain, can ask your men to push themselves harder than normal.  If you ask your men to push beyond their limit too often, your men's morale will drop.  I like this feature as well.

As for the hide and seek aspects of the missions, they are pretty much the same as SH3 and SH4.  Not a whole lot new there.  Perhaps the sub hunters are a bit smarter and quicker on the draw, but not so much so it has any real change in game play.

So...there are some good things in Silent Hunter 5, but the good does not come close to overcoming the bad.  Even if you are a Silent Hunter fan, I would recommend you think twice about purchasing this game.  It just isn't worth the hassle and headache.

To make sure you absolutely do not have that option, they also force you to play against Panzer Elite in multiplayer setting. There is no way to opt out!

My biggest negative (and there are a lot of them) is that isn't intuitive. You get thrown into fights after long movie sequences, die, then have to go through the same sequence again. This happens frequently that there are no game-save opportunities and you have limited time to do the exact proper sequence to win a battle. Typically you have to do a major quest before moving on and there are limited minor quests to get points to level up. Several occasions I had to go into easy mode to get past a specific quest otherwise your stuck there running around not gaining any ground. I hate having to do that.

The maps are terrible and have no real use, the quest pointer isn't well thought out and pretty much useless too.
Somebody wrote that the quests are dull, I agree for the most part. Find and fetch, kill some rodents, bugs and annoying people.

- Game advertises itself as an Action/RPG. In reality, this is nothing like Baldur's Gate or Diablo, but it is more like a beat'em up arcade (think Mutant Turtle Ninjas in arcades).

- There is ZERO Artificial Intelligence. In Single Player, you control one of the 4 X-Men, while the other 3 are controlled by the AI. Normally, this would work, but not in this game. I had X-Men falling from bridges (very expensive to revive them, unless you replay that segment), X-Men standing on grenades and not moving, X-Men getting a beating with no reaction, and so on. If you think Single Player - then DO NOT get this game.

- There is no way to really 'control' what the other 3 X-Men are doing. While pressing L should bring them to where you are, this hardly ever works. And if they come to where you are, the moment you let L go, they run back to fight.

- There is no way to set-up the use of potions for these 3 other X-Men. You can only choose to have them use potions at 20% or 40% of their health, but 20% is not enough (by the time they use the potion - IF they use it - they are dead) while 40% is too much (they start chugging potions when is not needed). Choosing other options or percentages is of no use too.

- There is no way to go alone to scout, if you already have the group with you (similar to Brute Force or KOTOR). They always follow you and even when you set them up to NOT charge the enemy, they will still do it.

- Like in LOTR: Third Age, your characters level up every 2-3 minutes. This gets annoying really fast, especially since you only get 1 point every time and most skills require more than 1. Still, basically you have to go through 3 menus every 2-3 minutes, to level up.

- This game gives new meaning to term 'linearity'. There is always just one way to go. Even Fable seems non-linear with respect to this. Invisible walls are everywhere, even though you can see the road, you cannot go on it. No real surprise here since this game is a beat'em up and this linearity is typical of these games.

What is good about the game:

- good graphics and distructable environment. Never get tired of breaking walls, etc.

- even if it is presented poorly, the story is good enough.

- length of the game is around 20 hours, 3 times that of most new games.

- X-Men characters (old and new) are excellent. Skills - even if not a lot of them - are a lot of fun.

Overall, unless you are an X-Men fan, I would not recommend this game. I think the potential is definitely here, but execution is amateurish (strange, since Raven has been around for a while). If they work out the AI issues in the next one, I may give it a try.","Best X-Men game, but still far from being a good game",1119139200,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

The movie Jumper is definitely one of those movies I really want to love. And having watched the movie, I immediately wanted to see how a game based off of your character zipping around the world in the blink of an eye would translate to gaming on my XBOX 360. Well after several hours of watching my character jump around my opponents in melee combat, I saw all there was to see.

Gameplay is criminally simple: Your A,B,X,Y buttons translate to locations around your opponent from which you can jump to and attack. Press B, and you jump in front of them with melee attack, Press X, and you attack them from their left, and so on. Your character can chain a specific combination of attacks to go from start, mid, and finisher moves. You learn more combo moves not by the experience of fighting, but by collecting... comic books... Ok. The moves themselves get repetitive quick, and the finishers while matrix-esque, are not unique enough to get you excited to seeing them performed. About the only cool part in finishing off your opponent is the occassional scripted sequence where you dispatch an enemy in some crazy jumper-ific way. While the location you kill them at is set by the game, the first time you see Griffin jump several thousand feet in mid-air with his opponent, only to jump away leaving the baddy to free-fall to his death is awesome. Unfortunately as said before, its a scripted sequence you can't control where, nor when it happens.

The game levels themselves run on rails, so despite the movie's tagline that ""Anywhere is possible"", that's not entirely true with the game. Sure you play in iconic settings that were from the movie, but you don't even get the ability to 'Jump' anywhere in that level. You can however teleport short distances in the level that you're able to move your 'jump cursor' to, (which are always ground-based locations) and special 'focal points' in the level that were designed to allow you to jump to areas that you can't necessarily walk to. For a game that is set in a movie with no limits, you certainly do play with them.

In the end the game is a frantic button masher, trying to press the right button to attack from and chain moves together so your opponents aren't able to counter attack. There is no save-game feature aside from the usual checkpoint system, so if you screw up and die, you may have re-mash those buttons on waves of bland Paladin fighters as well as other types of enemies the movie doesn't cover. I guess the one real surprise from renting this game was how rediculously easy it was to rack up 350 gamer points in just 20 minutes of gameplay. The developers basically took 20 simple goals and tagged 50 points to each one of them. So if you have the patience to grind through scores of Paladins with baseball bats (yes, baseball bats!) and those electric cow-prods, you should be able to pump up that GamerScore quite nicely.

But all in all, if you're looking for a gaming extension to do what you saw in the movie, don't bother being disappointed and 'jump' clear of this over-priced, railed fighting game.",A game that falls painfully short of its true potential... just like the movie,1203379200,19,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
2.0,False,"05 22, 2012",A30NE8XGK9F7U8,B000ZKNAFW,strife82,"Before I continue, I will admit to being quite the Bomberman geek.  Not quite a fanboy, but I do have enough interest in the franchise to always want to check out any titles I have my eyes on, but with enough open-mindedness to not love every Bomberman game I'd gotten (in all honesty, Bomberman Generation is one of the best games I'd ever played, while its ""sequel"" Bomberman Jetters was a weak-kneed disappointment).  And it was with both stars in my eyes and critism on my tongue that I dove into ""Bomberman Land Wii"".

And...well...I can't say I really liked it.

Maybe it's because it's too different from the usual norm, or that I'm pretty new to the whole ""party game"" genre, but, in all honesty, I just wasn't able to get into this as I'd done for other Bomberman titles.  That being said, I sorta knew what to expect (no adventure mode with lots of things to blow up, just a whole bunch of mini-games with some semblance of a story tossed on), but the overall appeal was quite lacking.

What I won't fault the game on is that the mini-games themselves have a certain amount of creativity involved; whether it's seemingly mundane tasks that is somehow able to excite (collecting coins off of moving logs, leaping on fast-moving lillypads) to forays into regular events (archery) or action-oriented fantasy (shooting octopi or monsters with cannons), each one is different enough from the rest to stand out on its own strengths (and weaknesses, of course).  They also run a pretty big gamut of locations, actions, and undertakings; one day you'll be shooting lava balls with a rifle, next you'll be destroying random objects with a samurai sword, and the next you'll be parking a car perfectly.  However you slice it, there is no major repeating of ideas here.

But what really kills it is the learning curve.  Some of the games are simple enough to get into and dominate, while others are just too difficult or unweildy for their own good (the Baseball and Flying Bomber events are among the biggest sinners in this regard).  This is made all the more worse due to the inherant randomness of the games' placements; you'd think that the further on you go in the game, the progressively harder things would get, but instead, each Zone is comprised of a hodge-podge of mini-games that range from silly and simple to hair-tearingly hard.

All in all, the one-player mode is a long, long affair (took me over 30 game hours...) that only has enough going on for a singular playthrough.  I really didn't feel the need to go through it a second time, as though I knew what to expect, it just didn't draw me back in.

As for the story, well...it's there.  It's nothing to really note, and while I can understand and accept Bomberman's (sorry Hudson, but I will NOT call him ""Cheerful White""!) sense of fair play, taking care of a bratty doppleganger is nothing so hard that a simple 4-level bomb blast can't fix.  But maybe that's just me...

But before you do on thinking this is a worthless title, know that the saving grace is, of course, the multiplayer.  Hudson thankfully reworked the old 2D grid-style battle mode that's been the bread and butter for almost every Bomberman title worth its weight in Fire Ups (the 3D version seen in the Nintendo 64 titles just didn't work out all that well, I'll admit...), and though the formula isn't as perfect as it was in Bomberman Generation (there I go again with my reverence...), it's still a lot of old-school fun.  But the best part of all is the amount of gameplay options present; the changes in the actual arena, the different mode rules (Capture the Crown, Point Battle, etc.), and, as the kicker of them all, the All Out option, which throws you into a randomly created multiplayer battle, giving one a true test of one's bombing ability.  No one gets out alive, my friend...

So in the end, the multiplayer option is really what keeps this game from being Cut-Out Bin material, but don't expect much of anything in the single-player mode unless you're a hardcore party game kinda guy (or girl).  Mario Party this really ain't.",Once is enough.,1337644800,,,

2.0,False,"07 14, 2006",A3EK57ZHMA55G5,B000FJS4YA,Lestor neeker Wong,"My wife will swear that Sudoku is fun, but coming from a background of more epic stuff Mario and Zelda, you can understand why I don't see her point. True enough, Sudoku has its fair share of supporters, but whether it warrants a video game on its own remains questionable. That, however, doesn't stop the tons of Sudoku-related games on handheld consoles over the past few months. The likes of Go! Sudoku and Dr. Sudoku have made their rounds on the PSP and GBA respectively, and even the immensely popular Brain Age has a section devoted entirely to the game itself. Sudoku Gridmaster, released as a budget title, is the latest kid on the block.

As the core gameplay of Sudoku never changes, the things that separate Sudoku Gridmaster and other Sudoku video games are therefore purely cosmetic. You won't find any groundbreaking graphical presentation here, but at least the game tries to reduce the blandness by offering a small variety of backgrounds for the player to choose from. The soundtracks are also changeable, even though they tend to be rather distracting when the going gets tough. And trust me, the puzzles in Sudoku Gridmaster are tough. The game offers over 400 Sudoku puzzles spanning four difficulty levels, and the higher level ones may stump even the most seasoned player. If you go into the game expecting to breeze through the levels, be warned.

The game allows two modes of input. The first is the direct writing method, which is popularized by Brain Age. In fact, this method of input is very similar to Brain Age's. The player basically touches a square, and writes the answer on it. Unfortunately, the usual recognition issue does surface here though. For example, the game doesn't quite recognise my ""7"" properly, and treats it as a ""3"" instead. This is why a second method of input is included, I guess. This approach allows the player to choose a square, and then choose a number to be keyed into it. This will suit players who have problems getting their handwriting to work on the touch screen, but it's somehow less fluid as compared to just writing the numbers in.

Regardless of which method you choose, you will play each puzzle with a timer. You'll then be ranked according to how well you do. There's also an option to save and exit a puzzle at anytime, allowing you to return later to have a go again from the saved point. This is perfect for a handheld, since you'd expect plenty of on-the-run play.

For all its efforts to make Sudoku more fun than your usual pen and paper game, Sudoku Gridmaster has a fundamental flaw. A player can easily cheat by stopping the game, sorting out the puzzle on the top screen, and then resuming and keying in the answers on the touch screen without sacrificing in-game time. Although this defeats the purpose altogether, the fact that a ""feature"" like this exists may just be tempting enough for players who simply want a high score for every puzzle.

The sheer number of puzzles available in Sudoku Gridmaster will satisfy fans of the game. For others, however, the game may be less enjoyable. Backgrounds and soundtracks aside, Sudoku is basically just Sudoku. If solving Sudoku puzzles is all you wanted, stick to pen and paper instead.",Run of the mill,1152835200,3,,

It doesn't show up so much on a small analog TV, but if you plug it into

have the wavy issues.

Also the sound is just plain horrible. It crackles like a cheap stereo. I have tried
this system on several TVs and always the same thing.

 i got my PS4 fight stick to work today (with help from my tech savvy friends). it's very hard to change between LS, RS, & D-Pad on the side, so i leave it on left stick & sign in with another controller for d-pad or more acurate LS,then switch it back. the button placement is extremely fubar'ed(imagine L1/L2 buttons being on right & R1/R2 on left) another problem is an extremely inaccurate joystick (only 8 directions [N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, & NW], with no in betweens, the stick loudly clicks when a new direction is selected) last but not least the button sensativity is extremely aggravating (i like to rest my fingers on buttons in preperation to press when needed , not possible , random accidental discharge happens at the slightest touch) now i'm off to buy a fight stick from a company that actually tests a product before releasing it to the public.

shortly after writing the aforementioned review, sadly lacking in most respects, it somehow got worse. remember me switching to a regular controller for various functions? well the PS button is right next to the ps3/ps4 toggle switch , below a ledge on right side(my limited motor skills make it nigh impossible to change back if it accidentally changes)

i've gone back to using a regular controller with a rubber glove finger on my left index finger for added traction (i use controllers like keyboards)

2.0,False,"06 18, 2009",A3VK5RYGU94X5Q,B000FKBCX4,Critical Grad,"As mentioned in some posts, Spore was supposed to be revolutionary in a lot of ways.  This was a game of life!  You were going to grow, evolve and attempt to become a dominant species in many different aspects.  My best advice for gamers who still have not gotten their hands on it is to try not to get your hopes up too much.  You will be done with this title faster than a soft-serve ice cream cone.

Again, Spore is supposed to be a game about life and evolving yourself as a creature.  You will encounter 5 different stages in this game: cellular, creature, tribe, civilization, and space.  Each has a different style of game play and different look to it.

There are two very noticeable aspects to this game that are definitely pros.  First, the game is VERY pretty.  You will notice this first when you are in the cellular level.  Out of all 5 levels, this is the one I spent the 3rd most time on and have come back to many, many times.  You will want to spend a lot of time on it...but cannot-we will talk about that later.  The one I spent the 2nd most amount of time on was the creature stage, which is also very pretty.

The second aspect that excited gamers and still keeps them playing is the customization of, well, just about EVERYTHING in the game!  You have the power to create any creature, vehicle, and building you want in the game.  The most awesome part is that it is not solely aesthetic either.  The very advanced creative engine helps you to make creature that will use all their limbs the way a creature with those proportions would.  This is physics to a whole new level folks.  The same goes with vehicles.  You can make boats, planes and land craft that move however you want them to.  I remember making my own mech just like in the game Mechwarrior and it moved like it too.  The possibilities are simply endless.

Another awesome aspect about the endless creations are that you can share them with many different spore users on the net.  It is literally a fan made universe.

With all this glimmer, you must be wondering how can Spore be receiving these horrible reviews, including yours!  Well, it comes down to this folks:  gameplay in itself lacks serious depth and you will pass through each level probably faster than you would like, no matter what difficulty you are on...all except for the space stage and you will be begging for that one to be over with!

It all starts with the cell stage.  As you grow, you do not get the same pleasure the other ginormous creatures get eating you.  You grow very fast and next thing you know, you are forced to go on land.  The creature stage is one of the longer stages and one of the most fun, however in a game of evolution and ecology, it seriously lacks depth.  I would have loved to have seen hundreds of different creatures running around, slowly trying to manage their region, etc. and then giving YOU the decision HOW you want to evolve.  Should you grow in intelligence or size.  But that is not what happens in this game.  You are then thrown to your next level.

Now it may seem exciting to come to the point where you can make vehicles and really get some strategy into play, but that isn't going to happen.  You might deck out a vehicle with 100 guns and expect it to be a massive killing machine, but the only result is a small boost in killing power.  In fact, only 1 of those guns will actually fire.  Sad, right?  Customization in this game, including that of your creature is only face level most of the time and has little impact on the strength of your creature, vehicle or building.

Each subsequent level goes by faster and lacks more and more depth.  Then you get to the space stage.  This is a simply endless level that has you running around doing tasks and will force you to ultimately run back and forth defending your planets from invaders like crazy.  Where does it end?  You can try to find the center of the universe where a cutscene will talk to you and then you can continue on the game.

So should you buy it or not?  This is the first time that I have ever given a game such a low rating and yet been hesitant to say no.  The reason is that there is potential for some to get enjoyment simply out of the endless creations they can make.  In fact, before the game came out, there were already thousands of creatures made on the creature creator.  There is a lot of enjoyment in the music, funny creatures, and awesome vehicles that can be created, but for those that are looking to DO more and not create more, your enjoyment will be over before you know it.

In brief, if you are a creative person and LOVE the fact that you can make your own buildings, creatures and vehicles, then the game is perfect for you and you can expect to get minutes, hours, days and months worth of enjoyment out of it.  You people SHOULD buy it.

The game itself is decent, and it's broken up into five stages.  The first is trivial, but since the game is new to the player, it's not awful.  Stage two is either a lame ""simon says"" program, or a trivially simple mini combat game.  After that, the game becomes a fairly average RTS.  In Spore, you get to choose parts for your creature, then dress them up, then choose the look of buildings and vehicles.  None of it is terrible, none of it is the great new thing many people expected.  Gameplay is safe, some fun, but nothing exciting.

Which makes Spore an overpriced, fairly average, Real-Time-Strategy game with pretty pictures and an offensive Digital Rights Management tool which you might see mentioned elsewhere in the reviews.

This makes it a bit uncomfortable, especially when trying to press the Blue & Green buttons.

In 3D fighting games where I press Blue & Green to perform a grab, my thumb often hits the Red button accidentally. This is because the controller is so large, you often hit an 3rd button when you are doing a grab.

You start out with a somewhat weak game and you improve upon it to the point where it's actually worth playing. This happened with Assassin's Creed (first game) and ended with Revelations (the last before Assassin's Creed 3).  So, Revelations was definitely on the right track. It still had a few flaws, but overall worked and worked well.  The whole island thing and Desmond potentially losing his mind story arc had a lot of promise. Then, in this final installment, it's ruined by being overproduced and overdone.

So, here comes Assassin's Creed III.  So, the first thing I notice is that Ubisoft has tossed out the old gaming engine they were using for every previous game and they've now introduced another one.  Presumably, this change was to support both Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed Liberation.  I'll come back to Liberation in a bit. So, by choosing a new gaming engine, they also redesigned Desmond's character model? This is the first of many inconsistencies that just drive me nuts about AC3. Desmond's face is all long and distorted and he just looks wrong. He doesn't look like Desmond. So, what's up with that?

Story

So, onto the story. The story is basically an unmitigated mess. You're still playing as Desmond using a rogue Animus. This time, you're in a cave inhabited by a digital being like Minerva from previous AC stories.  Except, we don't know this digital character's motives. Oh, she's speaking and explaining her plight to Desmond, but not really saying a whole lot. Basically, she pontificates a whole lot about trying to save the world by doing this or that, but ultimately failing. So, Desmond is now in the Animus looking for a 'Key'.  In that goal, they have to locate power sources to activate several different panels in this cave so they can get to the 'end'.  Into the Animus Desmond jumps.

When in the Animus, you start the game playing as Haytham, a colonial assassin. We get no real back story about Haytham, but he's an adept assassin who has all of the same moves as Altair and Ezio. The Haytham story line progresses for several real playing hours until Haytham meets up with a native American woman and the two have a fling and a kid (which is not a visual). Their offspring is Connor. However, Ubisoft decided to cut out any relationship story between Haytham and his apparent one-night-stand. So, we have no idea what transpired there. Next thing we know, Connor is now a kid as the player character and we are out playing hide-and-seek with a bunch of other native American kids.  So then, Connor's village is burned down (and his mother killed) by some colonial men and Connor vows revenge.

So, after 2 hours of playing as Haytham as an extremely long and mostly boring tutorial, you're now starting over again playing as Connor. From here, you go through the long excruciating cut scenes getting Connor to the point where he can even become an Assassin (another several hour stint).  Ok, so here's the first real problem.  The game should have started with Connor from the beginning.  The Haytham segment should have been cut out.  Leading up to the Connor just prior to becoming an assassin, the cut scene should have shown the village being burned and Connor's vision. After that, it should have progressed right into training to become an Assassin.  Meeting Haytham later could have just been the main character he saw burning his village, it didn't need to be his father.

There were lots of other parts after you get to Connor that were added that just simply wasted tons of time (i.e., being a ship's captain and the naval canon warfare).  For example, most of the main quest challenges that are so in your face you want to throw a controller at the screen. All of that could have been skipped and not missed.  So, after weeding through Connor's quite long and boring cut scene filled gameplay, you finally get to the key, which Haytham had all along.

The key opens 'the final door' and the ending of Desmond's story is, well, not worth waiting for. I won't spoil it here, but suffice it to say that it seemed to have been set up to have a multiple choice ending, yet it didn't happen.  What happens to Desmond and, indeed, the world is just so predictable.  I would have expected a whole lot more to the Desmond story line than what came out of it.  It looked like Ubisoft needed a way to end the story and they tied it all down to the 12-21-2012 date and wrote a story that seemed to fit but ended up predictable.

Story Problems

Neither is Connor nor is Haytham likable. You don't really come to care for them or their plight. These characters are just too two dimensional.  Worse, that Connor chooses to become an Assassin just to kill the people who burned his village seems a bit extreme.  For Altair and Ezio, their stories worked.  For Connor (and Haytham), it fails.  The setup wasn't done well enough.  Basically, Ubisoft needed about two or three more rewrites to this story before ever designing a level. I also personally wouldn't have chosen this era of time to place the story.  1776 is just not really a time most people would want to see of our history within a modern video game.  I would have choosen something far more modern (WWII) or something much more distant past, but after Ezio's time.

Cutscene Galore

This game made one of the biggest mistakes I've seen in a game of this notoriety.  It decided to use cutscenes to not only begin and end quests, it liberally intersperses them into the actual game play driving it to a complete halt.  We don't buy games to watch cut scenes.  We buy games to actually PLAY them.  Unfortunately, this game is so filled with cut scenes, you'll find yourself skipping and skipping and skipping every single one of them at about halfway through the game. I'm amazed that the game director actually let the game go out the door like that.  It's a good thing that this is the final game as I don't think the next game would have near the amount of people buying it.

Environment and Graphics

While the environments are gorgeous, there are just too many gameplay issues that prevent the game from being truly fun. Although, the wilderness does look amazing. Connor's Assassin outfit, when you finally get it, is top notch.  There are some truly awesome visual design elements in this game.  But, as with movies, visual effects aren't what matter here.  It's the gameplay.

Fighting System

The fighting system was overhauled, but not for the better. Ubisoft dumbed down the fighting to two buttons, attack and counter. So, when fighting a guard, you have to use one of the two of these buttons. The problem is, when being attacked by a crowd of guards, you cannot focus on one guard and eliminate him.  The game constantly forces you to switch focus to the most recent attacker.  So, if you manage to get a guard to the ground, by the time he's down, the game has changed your focus to the most recent attacker and you can't finish the other guard off.  So, you're constantly trying to kill even just one of the guards.  Unless you can manage to the get the game into 'streak kill' mode, you cannot recover from this constantly switching focus problem.

With previous AC3 games, the engine specifically waited until you were done with one guard before having another guard attack you.  In this game, they all attack all at once or by taking turns, but none of them wait for anything to finish before attacking.  Some attacks can take nearly all of your health. Some attackers have a move where they will jump over you and attack you from behind.  You can't counter this attack nor can you even make this move.  If he's supposed to be a skilled assassin, how is it that the guards have more attack skill than Connor?

When roaming the wilderness, there is one other fighting mechanism that was introduced in AC3. This is the predator fight system. When you get too close to wolves, elk, bears or mountain lions, they'll posture, growl and then attack.  However, instead of the familiar grab-your-blade and fight them real-time, the game inserts one of those two random timed button attack things.  So, you have to press A then B or X then Y in a certain amount of time.  If you get one correct but not the other, you might have to press B a whole bunch of times to get the mountain lion off you (all the while draining tons of health). Whomever at Ubisoft thought this was a good idea should be ushered out of the building. Timed button attacks have no place in this kind of game. If a mountain lion is to attack, let me take my chances with a sword or a gun. I don't want to have to guess at which button is next or at getting the timing just right.  Thankfully, the animal does give a warning before it starts the attack, so you can whip out a gun or a bow and nail it before that whole thing starts. That's the only redeeming value to this part.

Health

Ubisoft botched this in AC3.  With previous AC games, there were Doctor's stations where you could heal.  You could also carry around medicine and apply it whenever you needed it. In AC3, this system was removed completely.  No more doctors or medicine. So, the only way to heal yourself is to get out of the fight and run away as you will slowly heal.  This means that to heal, you have to run away.  Worse, while fighting mode is activated, you heal twice or three times more slowly than when it's off.  So, you have to run away to get out of fighting mode just to heal yourself.  This is probably one of Ubisoft's biggest mistakes with AC3 (along with the abysmal story).

Gameplay

You'd think that Ubisoft would have the game controls down by now. Now, even though Connor is an Assassin, Ubisoft completely botched the stealthy aspect of this.  They did this by making you a trudging klutz and then by filling the roofs with guards about every other building so you now have to roam via street.  Gone are the fair maids you could hire for cover, the mercenaries and the coin flipping roof dwellers.  You are firmly on your own. Second, the fighting has completely changed and not for the better. No longer do you have the many different ways of attacking your opponent that AC1 and AC2 carefully taught you how to do.  No.  These are all gone. Now you have two moves, attack and counter.  Taking out your gun and trying to shoot a guard is way out of the question. That move is just far too slow.  Same for the bow. So, it cannot be done easily.  Worse, if you manage it, it takes far too long to reload to do it again. Yes, I realize it is a musket. Instead, you'll find yourself using desyncronization as a trial and error method to getting out of a fight.  In fact, it's actually faster to descyncronize than it is to attempt to run away and become incognito again.

Horses are probably the most worthless means of transportation in the game. If you can manage to keep the horse on tiny narrow trails, then the horse gets tripped up on rocks, water and just about every other little thing that it comes across. The horse will only jump the tiniest of things, so don't expect much with horses.  Even though they are relatively fast, you can't really use them for off road travel.  Expect to run if you want to travel off of roads.

Commentary on AC3

Ubisoft made a hugely risky and questionable choice at investing in a new game engine this late in the game (pun intended). Frankly, this change was to the detriment of this game. But, I think I understand the reason.  I believe the new engine was introduced so that this game could work on not only the Xbox and PS3, but also the PS Vita for Liberation.  In that game, you play as Avaline De Granpre.  She is an Assassin with basically the same moves as Connor. In fact, I believe the same game engine was used for both AC3 and Liberation.  The difference is that Avaline has personas she can take on (Lady, Assassin, Slave).  In these roles, she gains different levels of access to different quest pieces by taking on different personas.  But, in the end, the game is all about being an Assassin.  For the same reasons that AC3 isn't nearly as good as AC2 or any of the previous AC games, the same can be said of Liberation.

Glitchy is definitely the word of the day for Liberation too.  Specifically, when pigs fly.  Yes, in this game Pigs do fly, out of the back of wagons as these wagons trudge through town.  The game is just glitchy enough that even Avaline can fly when wagons roll through. I haven't seen too many glitchy issues yet with Connor, but I've definitely had control problems with both games.  The same problems I've had with all of the previous AC games are still in AC3. This part has not been fixed. The fighting engine was majorly dumbed down and actually Assassinating someone is no longer really that much fun as the controls are too klunky.

Overall

I thought this game might resolve some of the problems surrounding previous AC games, but instead Ubisoft made it worse by introducing this new game engine, introducing tons more cut-scenes and dumbing down the game play (while adding tons more guards).  When you do attempt to battle the guards, they just come out of everywhere all over the city and you just get ganged by them.  Worse, there are some guard types where you cannot win.  They will counter your counter and block your attacks. Some of them will even jump over you and attack you from behind. Assassin's Creed 3 is by no means a welcome improvement to the game or a fitting conclusion to this franchise.

A HUGE part of this game right now is completely shutting down the servers twice a week for four to six hour blocks and always in the evening.  You see at SWTOR they think people aren't in school or at work in the daytime so they make sure to keep the servers up at that time (sarcasm).  So when people have a late night they can stay up to play, theres a two in five chance that the servers will be down.  You'd think they would be able to shut servers down in rotation or have some kind of minimal interference plan for those playing.  NOT at all, they just shut them all down.  To heck with idea that people are paying a monthly fee to play.

The people playing SWTOR are essentially enhanced beta testers right now.  The enhanced part is that we have to pay for a game that isn't complete.  I made the mistake of calling customer service once and was appalled at how angry the twelve year old kids were on the other end.

In my month of playing I'm finding this game to rather tedious.  In order to level up you basically run errands and fight for things.  There are less than six voice over talents for the game so the immersion of role play kind of fall flat there. If you like to play on servers that are basically empty with less than twenty on a server then this might be your game.  They have set it up so there are eighty servers that are barely full, so your interaction with real people is practically nil.

You will probably want to play Star Wars regardless of any review to find out for yourself.

2.0,True,"11 3, 2015",A2ZRX2GV66BX93,B00Z9HS7BI,Kenneth E. Rathburn,"Before I begin: I was excited for Rock Band 4.  I was also nervous.  This started with the pre-order incentives/pushes, which are already bad enough when taking other games into account.  For instance, as a PS4 owner, I'd much rather have the few Xbox One pre-order tracks than the 30+ I got from Amazon.  But of course, that's not up to me.

But that's pre-orders, what about the actual game?

It's decent.  The soundtrack is arguably the most important selling point for this game, and part of the challenge is finding songs that haven't been a part of Rock Band in the past, be it from previous full games or DLC (total songs are getting close to 2,000).  I came from playing Rock Band on Xbox 360, so I couldn't bring my few dozen purchases over to PS4 due to ""licensing,"" which I can understand.  And since songs still cost ~$2 each, I don't mind it too much.  The cost there is reasonable, and this is the only acceptable form of microtransactions I've found in a game.  Looking at the songs included with the game itself, there are some fun and recognizable tracks.  Even if the names aren't familiar, when you hear them you'll likely go ""oh, THAT song!""  So considering previous content, the soundtrack here isn't bad, although without pre-ordering we get less actual songs than Rock Band 2 and 3 each offered.

Since I'm reviewing the guitar bundle, let's take a look at that.  Anyone acquainted with Rock Band 4 controllers will feel right at home with the new one.  It has a few touches and improvements over previous controllers, such as the neck and buttons feeling sturdier.  The strum bar still feels flimsy and I honestly think it's predisposed to stick downward out of the box, which always makes me think it'll drop notes.  Calibration is handled different, as the guitar has you place it in front of your TV for automatic calibration.  It seems to work well enough, though I feel the note detection can be off at times, especially since my PS4 doesn't display battery life (it takes 2 AA's, I use rechargable ones).

With regards to new additions, the only two I've found are the choice system in the tour mode, which is nice and adds a small dynamic to the game, and freestyle solos.  These I haven't messed around with because I prefer to play the entire song chart as it was originally designed.  The training mode made it seem pretty fun and I've heard positive things about it, so if the idea appeals to you (or you enjoy it), then more power to you.  Speaking of tour mode, just like the soundtrack, there's less content to find than previous installments.  Band customization is still there and fun, but the selection of gear doesn't push the window of personalization and, given that this is the franchise's fourth installment, I find it ironic we're taking steps backward, especially since the game doesn't look that much better and isn't even a visually-focused experience.

Just taking my above notes into account, Rock Band 4 is around a 3 out of 5 star game.  The soundtrack is good, not quite great; the controller gets about the same marks.  So why did I dock it down to 2 stars?  Three words: No Practice Mode.

I've actually heard from other Rock Band users (and Harmonix/Mad Catz themselves) that Practice Mode became less and less used after No Fail mode was introduced, which if that's the case, I'm honestly shocked.  For me, Practice Mode gave Rock Band life, because my peak skill level has allowed me to beat most of the songs on Expert, but some I just need to slow down to get used to the rhythm and note patterns.  That's how I was able to beat songs on previous installments like ""Painkiller,"" ""Panic Attack"" and yes, even Guitar Hero songs like ""Raining Blood"" and ""The Devil Went Down to George"" on Guitar Hero 3 (I'm sure most of us remember those).  No Fail mode doesn't let me get acclimated to the songs, it just means I can keep playing without actually improving.  And keep in-mind: I'm mainly a heavy metal fan, and the song I looked forward to playing the most was ""Metropolis Pt. 1,"" a 10-minute Dream Theater song.  It's one of the few on-disc songs I still can't beat.  I always fail around the final solo in the instrumental section about 5 to 6 minutes in.  Without Practice Mode, I'd literally have to play through those 5 to 6 minutes just to ATTEMPT the part that has me stumped.  And even then, if I managed to beat it, I'd have to do the same thing if I hope to have a chance at doing it decently.  That's not a good gameplay experience.  Lack of Practice Mode honestly kills the game for me because I can't play it at a pace or style that works for me.  This has both discouraged playtime and the possibility of me buying more content.  Like I said, my genre of choice is heavy metal, and those tend to be the most difficult songs on guitar, which often resulted in me using Practice Mode to pass and eventually get better.  No Fail mode doesn't accomplish that, and the ""no fail"" definitely doesn't apply to this particular misstep.

Also, the game doesn't even have a regular training or tips & tricks section.  I know most of the people who pick(ed) up Rock Band 4 are established players who know how to play the game, but there's always a chance that someone will want to give the series a go for the first time with this one.  If they have no idea what a hammer-on or pull-off is, they're honestly better off finding an older controller and copy of Rock Band 1, 2 or 3 and using those since they were far more complete.  And at least then they can slow songs down to better get used to how the game plays.  But no, the only training mode is for Freestyle solos.

Those are my thoughts, which have mostly amounted to grievances.  I'm personally tired of new games containing less and less content than previous installments from past generations.  It just makes gaming feel like it's going backwards.  Not to mention games are hardly in a fit or complete state at launch, which only makes buying them a year later feel much smarter.  Rock Band 4 has been an incredibly bittersweet experience for me so far, but the bitter has definitely been overpowering the sweet.  Needless to say, I'm feeling quite a bit of buyer's remorse.

Update: I've elected to return my bundle due to the game simply being of greater frustration than anything.  It doesn't justify the price, and the fact Harmonix employees were recently caught red-handed posting positive reviews of the game screams immature business and general insecurity.","Less of a Full Game, More of a Song Pack",1446508800,20,"{'Edition:': ' Guitar Bundle', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

As for me, I purchased this game. No problems with my install.

The worst thing about Turtle Beach headsets, as many others have noticed, is the BUZZING.  Whenever the mic function does decide to work, there is a constant, annoying buzzing sound in my ear.  It ranges from loud to quiet depending on the day, but it's always irritating.  I thought it was a defect until I read so many complaints about the same thing and realized all of these headsets are like that.

The headphones are bulky and hurt my head after awhile.  This is a minor complaint next to the poor quality talkback cable and the constant, annoying buzzing sound.

I sort of compare these to Beats by Dre - poor quality, but they sell like hot cakes for an expensive price due to their brand name.

***Edit***
As of October 2014, I am completely fed up with this product.  I bought a $14.99 replacement talkback cable, which fixed the problems I mentioned earlier.  That cable had less buzzing also.  Now that cable has also failed (or some other aspect of the unit), and I can no longer hear the game sound through the earphone.  I can hear other players talking, but not the game's sound itself.  So I can either drop another $14.99 on another cable which may or may not work, or just accept that this headset is a POS and stop using it altogether.  What a waste of money.

2.0,True,"09 14, 2014",A106ZCP7RSXMRU,B00EFRN2KY,Lil MamaKitty,"I have been an avid simmer since Sims 1, and even dabbled in creating custom content. Sims 3 was such an improvement over Sims 2, which itself was a huge leap forward from Sims 1. So of course I had to get Sims 4, with great anticipation of the improvements. HAH! I'm now furious that I spent eighty bucks to preorder the Premium Edition Sims 4 and ended up with something akin to Sims 2 for console. It is literally more like an app game.

Everything we loved about Sims 3 is gone! I remember in Sims 1 and 2, the hours wasted on custom content sites, downloading yet another recolor of a dress just so my new sim could have something different to wear. Sims 3 made any recolor possible, for clothing, furnishings, etc. A truly customizable world that sim fans wanted. Well forget that in Sims 4! Nope you will have a handful of color options to choose from for each clothing or furniture style, no color wheel or patterns to customize, and remember the lazy color-blind creators that worked at Sims 1 & 2, who gave us the mint green fridge that didn't quite match the dishwasher? Yep, those design nightmares have returned, so good luck finding things that actually go together! At least we had a dishwasher in Sims2 even if it didn't exactly match the other appliances. No dishwasher in S4, no cars, no laptop... What is the point in giving our sims outfit options (5 possible outfits can be created for each type, ie everyday, formal, etc.) that our sim will randomly choose to wear, when the choices are so limited? Even the hair and makeup that we used to be able to customize to any color, with highlights etc, nope you will have a handful of fake flat hair colors and preset makeups to use. I'm sorry but the removal of the colorwheel and pattern choices, absolutely no valid excuse is acceptable EA! OK so you can pull on the sim's body and shape it, that is cool, but you can't do it to the hair and those choices are ridiculously limited. Frankly I could use the Sims 3 create-a-sim sliders to create as unique of a look that I needed for my game.

Then there is the personality dumbdown in Sims 4. No more favorite colors or foods, and the choices of traits are very lacking. Remember the fun of having an insane, neurotic sim who was afraid of the dark? All you get now is insane. Remember having the ability to make a custom life wish? Pick from a handful now. Ok, maybe I can forgive all that and just enjoy the game play. What the...? Where is the world? It is smaller than the original Sims 1 neighborhood! And you can't even go outside of your sims little area of about 6 lots without TRAVELLING -- remember that dreaded load screen wait in Sims 2 whenever your sim wanted to go visit a friend or the library? It's BAAAAAACK! Seriously? On my system it isn't the 'go make a sandwich and take out the trash' wait of Sims 2 load screens, but why remove the other best thing about Sims 3, the seamless open world?? And forget customizing the world, no world edit is available at all. There are so few empty lots, the new building options are really pointless because there is virtually no place to build anything. If this wasn't enough, I was shocked when my sim went to work, and I couldn't even click on her to view her simology or to see what was in her personal inventory.

In Sims 4, 99% of the game has just been dumbed down to nothing. In game play, the few positives are that the sims can multitask, and you have more family relationship options. There are more social interactions, they take selfies (a lot!), they feel happy or sad, they walk funny if they have to go to the bathroom, in fact you can give your sim a swagger walk or whatever as part of create-a-sim. Little things here and there that are cool, but to me that isn't enough. These should have been in addition to, not instead of, the advancements made in Sims 3. So, like many no doubt, I'm going back to rich and open world of Sims 3, an infinitely better use of my free time than this pathetic excuse for a 2014 game. Too bad I can't get my money back though.

Rome 2 is by far the worst out of all those games, what's worse is that I paid in full for Rome 2, which costs more than I paid for all those other games.

Rome 2 seemed like it wanted to do so much (add tons of factions, enlarge the map, new diplomacy system, etc) that it forgot the basics that made the series so fun. There's too many factions, the map is too large, and the new diplomacy system still makes dumb mistakes (I'm besieging your last city and you still don't want peace talks?!). To add on to that, there's too many unit abilities (battles should be won by strategy, not spamming abilities) and the most disappointing aspect of Rome 2 is the battle gameplay. The charges and clashes are amazing to watch, but the AI of your units are terrible (I'm currently playing on Hard as Sparta) to a point where you want to fast forward the rest. (Just a side note, they took out prebattle speeches and faction intro movies. WHY?!)

LAG is ever present in multiplayer and greatly reduces the player's chances of dodging enemy fire, even AFTER managing to get behind cover. Aiming down the sight is slow and isn't practical. Lag makes the knife a less viable weapon because your opponent almost always sees you coming. You learn to cope with the lag but in MW2 there was no perpetual state of having lag and when there was lag it wasn't this bad.

I prefer the way human faces and objects like cars are rendered in MW2 than in BO. Human faces in BO look less detailed and seem ""cartoony"". I was disappointed with the way the game rendered JFK's face. The faces of the North Korean enemy NPCs weren't drawn well and their voices didn't seem real enough unlike the Russian NPCs voices which were good.

In BO the player's view of the environment is wider and it feels almost like a third person view with the gun sight placed in the center. I prefer the narrower field of view in MW2. Most metallic objects like guns look too shiny and end up looking like plastic rather than metal.

Here are some positive aspects of BO:

1. The ""Jungle"" multiplayer map is impressive. The outdoor environment has dense vegetation, a rope bridge and elevated huts. It's the best jungle environment I've seen in FPS games so far.

2. The in-game UI is polished and more intuitive than in MW2.

2.0,False,"11 16, 2006",A2582KMXLK2P06,B000HTWX22,Bryan,"I know, I must be REALLY crazy to give the Playstation 2 an overall rating of 2 stars. Hear me out:

First of all, I must be the only one who happens to think it's a total scam that the DVD player built inside the Playstation 2 was never re-created to work properly. It's really a bad business move on the part of Sony to never listen to ALL the phone call and email complaints that were directed to them about the DVD players inability to work correctly for most people. The honest truth is that the thing NEVER worked right. Sony probably didn't fix it deliberately because the Playstation 2 was selling so well (and continues to sell) they probably figured they didn't need to bother. Furthermore, the DVD player was probably added on in an attempt to make the PS2 smear the competition (which admittedly, was a strategy that WORKED, because the Gamecube has been knocked out and the Xbox never became as popular as the PS2).

Even if you ignore all the negative opinions on the DVD player, you can't ignore the fact that the console itself had other problems. Many times the Playstation 2 would overheat and that would cause the games to stop working momentarily. This becomes a problem the longer you play a game because the PS2 was never designed to run for long periods at a time. So what this means is that it's not right for you, the consumer, to have to purchase a Playstation 2 for more than 100 bucks, in my opinion. That's just an unbelievably high price for a gaming console that may or may not work correctly and also includes a shaky DVD player. If you buy a Playstation 2, you won't know what to expect.

I think the biggest problem I have with the Playstation 2 is probably not really Sony's fault, however, it's SOMEBODY'S fault. I'm talking about the absense of innovation. When the PS2 came out, there really wasn't much left in terms of groundbreaking new features in the world of gaming. All those extraordinary innovations ALREADY happened on the Playstation One. Really, the only thing the Playstation 2 had going for it was ""more hours of gaming"" and ""better graphics"" over the PS1.

Remember all those Playstation One games that were so revolutionary? Silent Hill, Final Fantasy 7, Resident Evil 2, Metal Gear Solid. Those are the main ones. Those games appeared on the PS1 in all their influential glory, which means when the sequels to those games were released for the PS2, really, all we had were updated graphics and longer gameplay. You see, compared to the Playstation One, the PS2 had better graphics and the games took a LOT longer to complete, which, granted, is a GOOD thing. However, updated graphics are hardly a revolutionary thing by todays standards. In fact, I'm convinced talking about good graphics in the year 2006 is pretty pointless. You want to talk about innovation? How about the jump from 2D to 3D? This happened on the Playstation One, not Playstation 2. Now THAT is what I call ""a revolutionary step forward in gaming"".

Speaking of 2D games, want to know another reason why the Playstation One was better? Because it featured a perfect blend of 2D AND 3D games. The PS1 wasn't created for the sole purpose of dazzling gamers with amazing graphics. No, the PS1 was created for showing gamers how to have FUN with a game, in addition to the realistic revolutionary step forward into the land of 3D gaming. The Playstation 2 was, unfortunately, just ""a seemingly neverending stream of boring 3D gaming"".

You see, as someone who grew up as a teenager with the Playstation One, I can remember clearly how people approached gaming back then. We didn't go into each game with the mindset that each game had to have ""incredible graphics"", we went into each game just expecting to have fun. That's how we judged video games back then. When a game with incredible graphics came along, such as Resident Evil 2 and Final Fantasy 7, we treated them with open arms just like we did with other games.

Yes, it's true that back in the PS One days we put the games with exceptional graphics on a different level from the other games, but we did NOT criticize the graphically-average games JUST because graphically-superior games were available at the time. We treated games with good graphics and below-average graphics equally *as long as* the average or bad-looking games offered enjoyable replay value. And guess what? Most of the time they did. That's how you appreciate a video game.

Today, with the Playstation 2, people are so concerned with only great graphics that many times the gameplay suffers as a result. This means that yes, the Playstation 2 smears the Playstation One in terms of graphical power, but when it comes to actually having fun with a game (along with the previously mentioned all-important innovation aspect of gaming) the Playstation One absolutely DESTROYS the PS2. So overall, the Playstation One was not only more fun, but also more important. The Playstation 2 ruined the mindset of gamers that ""every single game"" had to look good, and for that, I will forever look down on the Playstation 2. The WWE wrestling series is now worthless, for example. However, I'm not angry with Sony directly, because the PS1 was *phenomenal*.

Here's the worst thing about judging graphics- in a few years, everyone will change their minds and look down on the Playstation 2 for having horrible-looking, dated graphics. Yes, it will be the same people who once praised the graphics, too. I guess that's the price you pay for judging the way a game looks and *nothing* else about the game. You watch, in a few years the games people consider ""cool"" today will have no purpose to exist, according to them.

As for longer gameplay experience, that's overrated too. Why? Because it's entirely possible that a 20-minute game can be JUST as good as a 20-hour game. I STRONGLY disagree with the people who think there's no excuse for short games to exist these days. No. A game shouldn't have to take a long time to complete. The longer the game, the more boring it'll inevitably be, and the less likely you'll care about it years from now because you'll remember how much work went into actually completing it.

Another Playstation 2 complaint- I don't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad. Using an analog stick is annoying because you don't feel comfortable with it. Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad. With an analog stick, you slide all over the place. In addition to that disaster, the PS2 controller also suffers from ""too many buttons"". We shouldn't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game. The Playstation One had the best controller ever. It was comfortable, you were always in complete control, and it just looked better.

Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the only worthwhile thing the Playstation 2 has going for it- a few good games worth purchasing. Grand Theft Auto is probably the biggest series on the PS2, and guess what? It's good. It's great, in fact. It's innovative too, the only important thing the PS2 ever had. Unfortunately, with games like Saints Row on the market, the uniqueness of Grand Theft Auto is starting to wear thin because of all the unnecessary copycats.

Anyway, besides that game, what you can expect to find if you own a PS2 are many (and I mean MANY) mission-objective army games, World War II games, and maybe a few lackluster platformers here and there. Oh, and we can't forget about all those boring racing titles that are designed to appeal to graphic freaks and not to people who actually like to race. The Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid series were also pretty decent, but, in the case of Silent Hill, improved graphics don't necessarily mean spookier, more interesting gameplay. The original will always be the best.

If you like shooting guns and racing cars, hey, the PS2 is your new best friend. But if you want something more, seek a Playstation One. The Playstation 2 is just a long list of mediocrity. Thanks for ruining the fun.",skip the PS2,1163635200,9,,

The trick system feels extremely linear and leaves no room for experimentation. When I first bought Amped, I was expecting a snowboarding game based on realism, but I soon found out that Amped is NOT realistic at all and SSX Tricky, also on X-Box, is easily a much better game.

This game is nothing more than a 2016 version of 2002's Dirt To Daytona with updated cars/tracks and slightly updated graphics, that's it, literally everything else is copy/pasted directly from their previous game, Dirt To Daytona, which came out nearly 15 years prior. The physics and audio are 100% recycled, they did absolutely nothing to improve it (the twitchy car is back once again 15 years later). The car audio is comical in how dated and awful it sounds, it's dull, the cars simply don't sound like that anymore. The crash audio, tire screeches, wall contact sounds are all the same and recycled.

And you might say ""that's fine, I liked Dirt To Daytona"" and that's exactly what I thought, but once you sit down and actually play it after dumping $65 on it, you're left with nothing but disappointment and it gets boring really quick as in the end, it plays like a PS2 game and not at all like a PS4 era racing game which is unacceptable. I can't believe they put out such a lazy effort. Twitchy car handling (like you're using a d-pad still), no sense of speed, dull graphics and track detail... it literally does feel like you're back in 2002 when you play it. You can say what you want about the Eutechnyx games, but at least they had pretty decent graphics and good car handling and physics (minus the crash physics). In this game, you can't even hold your line because the car is so twitchy no matter what mode or what tweaking you do which makes it near impossible to race at the restrictor plate tracks without wrecking just trying to hold your line.

Like I said, I loved Dirt To Daytona back in the day, I still feel it's the best console Nascar game ever and I still pop it in from time to time for nostalgia, but that was back in 2002 when the standards for games were much different. Now in 2016, we have much higher standards with games like Forza, Gran Turismo, F1, Project Cars and even DriveClub which are all phenomenal racing games and feel very good and then you have the Nascar games which continue to do nothing but decline. This game doesn't even have group qualifying in it and their DLC plan is a joke. There's no series that needs a bail-out more than Nascar, I expected a lot more out of DMR considering they are essentially Monster Games who released some of the better Nascar games back in the day. I'll give them one more chance, hopefully they'll listen to all these criticisms and improve upon them with the next one, but I lost a lot of my faith in them already with this one and they'd have to release a stellar product after this to get it back. If only Codemasters would step up and snag the Nascar license, they'd be absolutely perfect for the job and they would not screw it up at least to the degree EA Sports, Eutechnyx and now DMR have.

Save your money and pick it up when it's inevitably $20 next month if you absolutely need a new Nascar game or liked Nascar Heat and Dirt To Daytona and would like to play those games again with a new coat of paint.

The concept sounded awesome - like you're this hitman going around doing missions and killing people.  To be honest, I have not finished the game.  The action is very slow paced.  You have to plan things out.  There's no way you can finish a map the first try cause you have to know the pattern.  For example, when the limo driver makes his routine routes, or when the bad guys go inside the shops, or when the bystanders are not looking, etc....

Even the maps get more bigger and it's so big that it takes forever to get around.  sometimes you have to do 6 sub-missions on one map, which can suck because if you screw up on the 4th sub-mission, for example, then you gotta start all over again.  basically it's a lot of trial and error.

pros:
+ at about 4.25"" in length, it's about the size of a standard mouse, which i liked
+ different grip cases
+ customizeable LED light color
+ programmable buttons but not too many (this is relative to my needs)

cons:
- the back/butt feels too fat so it's not ergonomic for my hands compared to the G500
- there isn't enough indentation on the mouse where my ring finger lays (like the G500) so i have to grip it more to lift it up
- the toggle for smooth scrolling vs ratcheted scrolling is on the bottom, which is weird (the G500 has it on top, near the scroll button)
- this mouse is pickier about what surface you're using than the G500.  i used to just play right on my ikea desktop and the G500 responded perfectly but this one does not handle it so great, i will need to get a real mouse pad.
-- the biggest negative:  the liftoff distance is WAY too great (just google it to see what the distance of liftoff is for people)

Game summary: build a mall from the ground up.  Lay the floors, walls, stairs, doors, stores, etc.  Control marketing, staff, special events, and store price margins.  The game concept itself is great and appeals to any Tycoon fan.

Positive Aspects:

+ A great selection of decorations, stores, and improvements.  The possibility for combinations is really good.  Some stores can have up to 4 different ""departments"" and you can mix and match what's available in them.

+ The game interface is easy to use.  Once you're familiar with where everything is you'll find it very simple to navigate.  The buttons are all organized fairly well and make it simple to understand.

Negative aspects:

- the Graphics and Sound are rough.  Sometimes irritating.  Every single time you build something you must endure the sound of a construction crew at work - or shut the sound off.  The music is rather lame.  The graphics are poorly done.  Some of the animations are okay but overall the effects are lacking.

- There's no tutorial to speak of.  The one provided in the game is more of a brief talking head trying to explain a couple of things about the game to you.

- The gameplay is disappointing.  You can build this great looking mall with tons of different stores and endure a meager 30 people shopping in it.  Which of course doesn't do wonder for your finances.  It's difficult to tell how to attract people, how much to charge stores for operation, and what to research next.

unbreakable patterns where they can kill you without you ever being able to swing.
combat is so clunky I barely know where to begin..

blocking blows is spotty at best and your sword swings are painfully slow while enemies swing really fast by comparison and as such, you will die many frustrating and horribly needless deaths. the whole parry system could have been fun as well but instead turns out to be a chore (hold parry until enemy attacks then attack and repeat process over and over)

sailing seemed like it might be a fun aspect of the game, againthey ruined this since you do not actually sail any ships, you merely give direction and voila! you're there. yet another flaw in what could have been a very good game.

I preferred the past tomb raider games that had only occasional enemies and little attention on the blood/guts.. with a strong focus on roaming around and collecting artifacts and exploring and solving mysteries.

The game is good in a non-tomb raider sense.. and should have been a different title and not use the TR name so as to not interrupt fans that play for the exploration purpose.

One of the main reasons why i've played tomb raider games is because the combat was few and far between.. and when you did fight, it was rated pg.. so it didn't gross me out.. but this new game grosses me out and i don't even like looking at it as there is way too much attention put upon the detail of killing.. so much so that it reminds me of horror films and kids should definitely not play this game.

i have some friends that use to play this game series because it wasn't too much about killing and now they won't touch it and are so disappointed like me that it's like any other killing action game.

This game is not a TR game.  It is a Survival game. it changed genres

Hopefully the next TR game is a true one and gives me the experience i'm actually looking for.. before some other company takes up the reigns and steals my heart...

The sad truth is it's working as they intended when it leads everyone to the RMAH in frustration. Notice how your friends are not online anymore? I'm one of them. I just can't bring myself to play it anymore.

Everything leads to the RMAH in an insulting attempt to try and take more money from me after I already bought the game. This is why Blizzard should not have been in charge of their own RMAH. Not only that, but it used to be considered cheating to buy items... Bad just bad. It's great to go to their own forums for vindication to see just as many people as myself upset by Blizzard's greed. It has ruined this game.

This is NOT the direction gaming should be going. Truly I hope this game fails so they learn their lesson. Games should be made by gamers not super greedy executives. The sooner people accept that, the happier they'll be. True statement.

Pick any 10 and it wouldn't be a Diablo game (There are over 60).

Broken Difficulty Curve - Never fixed. I say broken, but if it's working as intended and leading me to the RMAH, then it's working as intended

Still in Beta - Borderline illegal. I'm sick of Software developers hiding behind the very laws created to protect the consumer

Blizzard North Left - It was a nice attempt by Activision, but clearly this game was designed by ""greedy"" executives, not gamers... a sad trend taking over the gaming industry

No Replay Value - I spent hundreds of US $ on the AH. I am tough. No one messes with me. Who cares?

No Skill Tree - What happened to sacrificing skills at the expense of others? Being spoon-fed everything is for babies!

4 Player Cap - What happened to the 8-player games? Oh, you couldn't even balance it with 4 players... okay I understand.

Vortex, Jailor, Invulnerable - These are curse words in the Blizzard community

Itemization really Blows - Like really blows! There's no decent sets anymore, names are meaningless, blues and yellows surpass legendaries, etc

Always on DRM - Like gun control, this only hurts the people who purchased the game legally. Hackers will get it anyways minus this crap

Prepubescent player-base population - I have to be careful here, there are many mature individuals that tried this game, but I think more and more will be leaving. The sad part about this statement is most players are older than 20... I weep for the future

Class Balance Nonexistent - I have no clue how they will do PVP without tons of ""hidden"" changes. Fail!

Forums more Exciting - Honestly. Grab a bowl of popcorn and join in. It really is more fun than the game.

DRM for Hardcore - Nothing is more rewardable than spending 100s of hours only to have it undone by a notorious server crash.

No Rewarding Battles - The cheap mechanics all unavoidably lead you to your death which unavoidably leads you to the RMAH. The end.

Lack of Endgame - What's the point? My dad can beat up your dad! Awesome! Well then I will go buy a new one at the RMAH. I like competition, but this is jouvanile

Scheduled Maintenance Overdose - Can't log on to play single-player game cause Blizzard is always fixing something they broke

Inferno Brick Wall - This is just another tactic to lead people to the RMAH

Designed for Consoles - Clunky and crappy. Of course Blizzards greed would lead them to multiplatform a PC game

Game overly polished - Like really, they control every aspect of your playing, which of course leads you to the RMAH

Battlenet 2.0 Sucks - Worst gaming forum ever! How do we force people to the RMAH? Gentlemen, I give you Battlenet 2.0

No Offline Mode - Blizzard's socialistic approach to control pirating at the expense of the honest players. Thanks comrades!

Act IV Short - really, did they put this act together in a month?

Lag Lag Lag - Lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag

General Chat Spams - Love the Korean workforce. I mean could we even call it a Blizzard game without 12-year-old WoW style spamming?

Drops Mostly Worthless - After spending hours and hours, I finally got a lvl 61 item that was kinda good, but not really

Why Roll Melee - Ranged does incredibly more damage and doesn't get their face smashed in constantly, though they get one-shotted which is just as frustrating

Auction House Oriented - Breaks game, pvp ladder, etc will be governed by this

Pay to Win - Really? Is there no real gamers out there anymore? Yes, of course there are, but they won't be playing Diablo 3

Created Korean Jobs - We'll see if Korea's new anti-Blizzard law sticks.

Blues rock Legendaries - What the crap are they called legendaries for?

Skill System overly-simplified - No sacrifices, no stats, no choices other than picking 1 of 20 lame skills with several variations... yawn

Designed for grandkids-grandma's - unfortunately this WoW-like approach ruined it for the rest of us by over-simplifying everything

10 Years Development - Was this an intern job or something? Honestly, why did this third-rate game take that long?

PVP doesn't Exist - Blizzard is just holding off on this one until people get more used to the idea their game is broken

No Skill Customization -Thousand of choices if you wanna die. Like one or two choices if you wanna live. But please, pick whatever you want

Cookie Cutter Builds - The dumbed-down skill system was supposed to eliminate this... instead it made it worse

Too few Quests - Everything is so linear

Too few Events - Same as above... yawn

Only 4 Gems - B-O-R-I-N-G

No Rune Words - Why take these out... oh, cause it wasn't about fun, but the simplified ""item hunt"" which leads to the RMAH... okay got it

No Public Gamelist - Another over-simplification tactic to prevent trades and promote... I'm so tired of saying this... yep, the RMAH

No Elective Attributes - Yes folks, you are too stupid to do this yourself so we will do it for you

Jay Wilson's Ego - The guy must mean well, I mean it's not his fault if he was told from the beginning to create a Zygna game

Error (Pick Number) - The battle cry of Blizzard's bad programming and lack of servers

Exploits Win Inferno - Well that used to be true... now you can just ""buy"" your way through if you please

No Cross-Act Waypoints - Why?

Diablo's a Girl - Sorry it needed to be said

Greed before Players - The formula executives have found to maximize profits and literally kill the true gaming experience. Bravo!

Punished for Grouping - They kinda fixed this by removing monster damage bonus, but MF?

Max Level Already? - Too fast. No sense of accomplishment

Hardcore Literally Impossible - Self explanatory

Farming lacks purpose - You need the best gear to farm. So when you finally can farm, you already have the best gear, so what's the point?

Glorified Zygna Game - All the sheople will keep the money coming in

CMs Troll Forums - Seems they are always justifying their design flaws, as if the RMAH wasn't the reason for them in the first place

Inflated AH Prices - This is probably due to the prepubescent mentality of most players' greed

Camera Angle Fixed - Why? Oh, it's not gaming atmosphere, but maximizing RMAH profits. Okay okay okay, I think I finally got it

Graphics Washed Out - Titan Quest had better graphics 6 years ago, but pre-generation graphics seems to be Blizzard's battle cry so I guess that was expected

Lack of Servers - Another method of maximizing profits at the expense of their customers again.

Worst Gaming-Launch Ever - Only to be surpassed by their next gaming launch

Craft System Broken - Too expensive to justify any of the crap it poos out on you

Isn't Diablo 3 - It's a wolf in Diablo's clothing. The original Diablo's weren't designed around the AH

Greed Greed Greed - I find it insulting that every aspect of this game leads me to the RMAH in another attempt to take more money from me.

Game isn't Fixable - The inescapable flaw of this game is it's not broken. Truly it's working as intended when it frustrates you into the RMAH.

The sad Truth - Anyone who says otherwise from anything written above is selling something. Sorry, but it's the truth.  You're not going to make very much money on this game (most people are looking for a game to play, not a job).  It is not Diablo 3.

List too Big - This list is just too BIG. Pick any 10 and it would be more than enough to make me move on.  There are plenty of games made for ""true gamers"" to spend your time on.

*On a side note:  Torchlight 2 appears to be the real successor to the Diablo franchise.  I'm not promoting Torchlight 2 in any way as it appears to have cons as well (kiddie graphics), but at least it's made by the original Diablo makers and doesn't have most of the above problems associated with greed.

Unfortunately, Resident Evil 5 lacks almost everything that made RE4 a good game in the  first place: interesting characters, a lot of well done boss battles, decent plot, and most of all, moments that are actually scary. Not once was I scared when playing Resident Evil 5. Not once. And this is supposed to be a horror game? It's about as scary as L4D, which isn't scary in the least. There wasn't a single thing in RE5 that surpassed its predecessor, aside from graphics and the fact that it has CoOp. Resident Evil 5 was just a really bland game.

Then there's the fact that RE5 is consolized. Sure, you can see more enemies on the screen on the PC version, but aside from that, what is there? Aside from that, there's the abomination Games for Windows Live that you have to install to play the game. Sure, it lets you make an offline account, but that doesn't stop it from being a pain. Thankfully, at least the PC version has mouse support. It strikes me as odd that mouse support is something that PC gamers look for in games these days.

The only really good thing about RE5 is the fact that it has CoOp. I can see why the developers included it, because without it, it would be absolutely horrible. Although I did have a ton of fun playing CoOp, it got old after a while. Not even CoOp can fix the bland, dull environments or the lack of any real horror elements. Resident Evil 5 seems really rushed compared to RE4. There are only two unlockable characters for Mercenaries Mode. Compare that to Resident Evil 4 and how it had four unlockable characters and a lot more content.

When I first heard about this game, I was really excited! So, I pre-ordered this special edition ASAP! Ohh boy, I am so disappointed once I started playing!!!! THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and UNPOLISHED. Capcom knew about the problems and still shipped the game.

First of all, the arcade cabinet as a bonus is cheap looking! The vinyl comes off in 3 days... it looks really really crappy. I don't even wanna put it anywhere in the room. Wasted extra $10 for this.

Second, those extra Gems u get for this version isn't so useful. WHERE IS MY PRE-ORDER BONUS GEMS AMAZON??? Never got it in the email... but honestly, I don't really need it, lol, so I'm not even bugging amazon.

Third, the game is unfinished and unpolished. As everyone has already heard, the DLC characters are already on the disc; but, you won't be able to use it unless u pay for it this Fall for possibly $5 each... $5x12=$60! That is ridiculous.

Finally, the online play is broken. The sound is broken; u can't even hear hadoken or some crazy static hurts your ear while playing. Not to mention, the game balance is so off. If you are like me, coming from Tekken background, you are automatically at the disadvantage because Ryu, Ken, and Akuma is still the strongest character in the game! Every time, I used Ryu and other street fighter characters, I would win online matches, but if I used Kazuya and Law, I would get my ass kicked ten times in the role for some unfair reason and just wanna throw my controller out the window.

I personally feel like SF characters > Tekken characters in terms of their strength. This game is made for the SF players who love 2D fighting game! It's so far away from tekken combo moves and etc.

Capcom really need to patch this game and give the DLC bonus 12 characters for free or else I am keeping this game at 1 star!

The QTE's are bad too, to add insult to injury. This isn't a game like Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy where QTE's are part of an interactive fiction/rhythm setup. QTE in this game is ""press triangle"".

When there is shooting, it's horrible, aiming is terrible, enemies spawn out of nowhere, and your teammate AI is braindead. Imagine playing a Chinese F2P knockoff of Gears of War, that's the combat.

Also, the ""tactics"" the in-game tutorials recommend are often wrong. For instance, when you first face the werewolves (called ""half-breeds"" in the game), the game displays button prompts, which you'd assume would be the way to stop the werewolves. No, the best way to stop them is to ignore the game's advice and intended mechanics completely, since they're broken, back up to a corner and start firing in bursts.

There are a lot of cutscenes. When I say a lot, I mean ""The most I've ever seen, more than Xenosaga I"". It's really interactive fiction, not a game. What's worse is you can't skip any of them.

While the graphics and voice over work are quite impressive, the story about werewolves attacking and some ancient order of knights in steampunk london, is, somewhat impossibly given the great concept, incredibly boring.

From the Jungles flooded rivers to the dilapidated city streets, you'll find the secret behind the zombie outbreak that took over the resort islands of Banoi and Palanai.

GRAPHICS & SOUND:

The physics engine and the graphics do not show any improvement exactly, but then again, they were more or less pretty good to begin with: the everything that needs to be beautiful is, and every undead or otherwise disgusting texture is present in sick* detail. Excessive use of explosives and/or flares can cause a bit of a lag. The sound is as good as ever, with eerie zombie wails always keeping you on edge, and synth heavy music that nicely keeps the chills going down yours spine. Another small tweak that I enjoyed is that weapons that have been customized with some sort of FLAME mod now give off ambient light in the darkness, plus being able to toss flares. That flashlight was a joke, right?

GAMEPLAY:

On top of importing already leveled up characters onto a new game, there is also the option of starting over fresh and choosing a customizable level-up structure for your character based on TOUGH, SURVIVALIST, BALANCED, or CUSTOM tiers. These pertain mostly to the non character-specific power-ups, but some deviations may be present. Also new welcome additions: when not out and about on a mission, there are central HUB's where several NPC's and the rest of the immune team will be stationed, serving as trader shops. You can also partake in missions for your NPC's that will allow them to be better equipped with weapons as well as items for sale. At key moments you will be required to reinforce the hub location; setting up barriers and trip mines, and fend of zombie hoards with the help of your NPC characters. DEAD ZONES are new as well, serving as closed off areas full of significantly tougher enemies that you can conquer in exchange for some very rare items. Dead zones are also heavy in number, so you won't be through with them quickly!

*NOTE* I might suggest you play through FIRST with your imported characters or the original four (Logan, Xian, Sam B, or Purna) before playing with John. Once leveled up properly, John is an ABSOLUTE WRECKING BALL and if you're like me and enjoy a thorough completion (i.e. maxing out all characters), you'll be frustrated on how hard killing zombies and surviving is when you're NOT John. In short, the dude has almost endless stamina and almost never needs health items.

ENTERTAINMENT:

You either chastised the first game for its repetitiveness and glitches, or you acknowledged it's faults and enjoyed the game anyway. At it's core, Dead Island: Riptide is a carbon copy of its predecessor: search for goodies, dismember the deadies, and soldier on. Weapon customization has expanded, as well as a few new undead types to hinder your progress. Tons of missions to take on this time around, although the majority of them consist of finding items and bringing them to the quest giver.

GLITCHES/HANGUPS:

More of the same from the last game which I'll point out, plus a few more:

+ The Quick Weapon Selection Wheel (R2) occasionally locks itself onto the screen when exiting a vehicle or boat (spoiler!) until button mashing inexplicably fixes it.
+ Some weapons are subject to mysterious disappearance upon customization, never to be seen again. As well as:
+ Striking a killing blow with a thrown weapon will sometimes cause the target to vanish out of thin air, taking your weapon with it.
+ Zombies apparently have INCREDIBLE aim. When one throws an object at you, it 99% of the time results in INSTANT death, regardless of health.
+ Online play is generally pretty glitchy, although it usually doesn't effect the gameplay too much.
- Unfortunately, the weapon cloning glitch didn't make it over from the last game.

OVERALL SCORE/REPLAY VALUE:

I gave a 2-star score because even though I enjoy both titles immensely, I was pretty disappointed to see that there was almost no effort made to correct the glitches that plagued the first game, and allowed them to be carried over to Riptide. In any other capacity, a product that does not perform correctly would be recalled or otherwise fixed in a timely manner. Too often I see that game developers seem to just say the hell with it, and release an unfinished game and either take forever (or not at all) to release a patch.

Other than that, I put my 'Enjoyment' at 4 stars because it still delivers quite a fun experience, and is still one of my favorite games for online co-op play. I'm not necessarily a ""trophy chaser"", but I do like to pace myself and aim for total completion of a game eventually. For that, I put the REPLAY VALUE of this game moderately high, there being 5 characters to choose from; all with very different styles of combat/survival. Also, it's great fun to beat a game once on SOLO, than to tear through the game again with a couple of buddies.",More of the same (good or bad?),1369267200,8,,

Ever since it was announced, gamers have been enticed by a graphic design that is similar to Tim Burton's style. Unfortunately, you can't judge a book by its cover--Death Jr. is cute, and despite a long development time, the final product is strangely half-assed and doesn't quite hit the mark.

The story isn't much of a blood-pumper. Death Jr. and his friends go to a museum during a class field trip and DJ tries to show off by opening up a mysterious treasure chest. As a result, the evil necromancer Moloch is released and begins to wreak havoc on the museum, in the process sealing DJ's friends in different worlds. The gameplay forces you to enter these worlds, fight through them, and find the missing pieces that make up DJ's friends.

The gameplay wouldn't be quite so bad if it weren't for a scatterbrain camera that results in difficult controls. The game is like a bastard child of Devil May Cry and Rachet & Clank. DJ attacks with a big scythe as well as nine different guns; including dual pistols, a rocket launcher, an electric gun, and hamsters attached to C4 explosives. There is a combo system that earns points as you rack up kills and destructive force around the level, and like Devil May Cry, a bonus is given to players who get high scores on each level.

Unfortunately, playing through Death Jr. just isn't that much fun. By the 11th stage or so I was nearly snoring through 100-hit combos. I found myself wanting each stage to end more and more quickly as the game progressed. Each stage brought something new to the table, but overall nothing impressed me as much as I had hoped.

I don't mean to sound so negative--Death Jr. definitely had a chance, though. The developers had ages to make it into a well-crafted platformer on the PSP, and they just didn't get the job done as well as they should have.

If you've played games on any platform you've probably come across this style of gameplay. It is found everywhere. There are rows of colored bubbles on the top of the screen. You have a bubble launcher on the bottom part of the screen. Your aim is to get three or more bubbles of the same color to touch. If you do, all of those bubbles will ""fall down"". Over time you clear the screen of all bubbles if you're good enough.

I think part of my issue is that I've played this game SO many times on so many different platforms - and in many cases it is done far better than it is presented here.

The sound is annoying. It is a high-pace, electronic kind of song which gets annoying very quickly. Even kids must wear down after hearing this too many times. I'm not sure anybody could find this enjoyable.

I'm a fan of the Wiimote and use it on many games. Here it gets frustrating. You're trying to arrange a bank shot off a wall and it just doesn't go properly. This game is all about making those angles work. When the controller gets in the way, it's not fun.

The backgrounds and menus are sub-par. So many other Wii games do amazing jobs with the menus and graphics. Here they are simple and cheezy. They don't even have to be special! They just have to be professional looking, and they are not.

It is a waste of time. The graphics are ok for the age of the game and the general idea behind the game is decent. But the game fails to deliver.

Some things i see wrong with it and it is really a combination of  these that makes the single player boring:

1)aircraft are difficult to control and more effort than they are worth without a joystick.

2)Maps are unbalanced. Playing strictly as one side, they are either to easy or to hard. Some maps are hard to beat even on the easiest setting. And some  you don't even need to play to win even on the hardest setting.

3) Ticket point bleeding ( you can reduce your opponents tickets by holding so many control points without ever killing them) is stupid. What really does it for me is the stupid AI. IF you had a decent AI, it wouldnt be as bad.

4A) AI is terrible and unbalanced. Your side is stupid. Sometimes they stand around, they use bazookas on infantry, they can barely take a control point without your help and it takes them forever to it. Their accuracy is terrible. And one enemy will keep 1/2 dozen or more busy for over a minute. They are basically cannon fodder that steals all your vehicles and gets them blown up. Increasing cpu time to AI solves the problem to a degree but it also makes the enemy AI a lot more difficult so  it is still unbalanced.

4B) The enemy AIs are expert snipers.... with any weapon. I have been perched on a large hill sniping and got hit  from sniping distances with just about every enemy weapon but grenades. Even the enemy planes can pick me off on the first pass with guns. The enemy AI is amazingly accurate even at distance. They are also crafty.  They always know where you are and can always get behind you or sneak pass you and come up from behind and shoot you. They are much better organized and work together to take all the control points. IE: all of your own AI will run to the same control point where they will spend anywhere from a minute to several trying to take it. The enemy AI will  head to different control points in small groups and capture several in quick succession. They will also grenade  your armor in a group and take it out quickly. Whereas your own AI will not do this or manages to get killed before they even get close.

5)Scenerios play out to fast. Because of the constant ticket loss( bleeding) from one side or the other that almost always occurs games are short. You may only spend 25-50% of your time fighting. The rest of the time is spent getting to where the fight is and waiting on respawns. It doesnt really let you have a big effect on the outcome of the game. The biggest effect on the game is holding the right amount of control points to cause bleeding( or stop your own). You will spend alot of time running around trying to do this. And as soon as you leave the control point  It will be taken over by the enemy again. Which makes this a completely pointless task.  It would be much better without ticket bleeding. Then it would be based solely on kills to win( winning by attrition)

6) A combo of the above really kills the game. And really lowers the replay value. You will probably find single player to be more annoying than fun.

7) Bonus: EA even fails at cheats. The godmode cheat for this game reduces your tickets to about 1/4 of  your normal starting tickets.  Since your almost guaranteed to bleed tickets within the first 2-3 minutes it makes for a very short game. It is sad when they even make god mode boring. I always use cheats after i get bored with the normal game  to add some extra spice. EA really failed with this games cheat codes.

I plan to uninstall the game and forget it ever existed because I'm so eternally frustrated to have come so close but can't quite seal the deal because of some stupid circumstances which didn't necessarily have to happen that way. I really hate this game. Give me Command and Conquer anytime over this piece of crap because I simply...like to win games. I've thought about playing Germany and Japan at the same time, but I just got better things to do.
P.S. I just beat the game, conquering the whole world for Germany and achieving Total Victory. The game is quite lame and boring, and I spent three marathon sessions in doing it so. Once I figured out the formula, the game becomes one-dimensional.",Frustrating game,1238544000,4,,

The graphics is just as good as War for Cybertron. Great environments although I wish this game was more open to exploring. The sound is amazing. The voice overs is fantastic. Just about every character including the basic soldiers have personalities. The game is more serious than the first one.

My main problem is the difficulty. I've been playing this game for about two weeks and I finally gave up. The difficulty is a bit much for me. I put it on easy and I still got destroyed quickly.

This is also one of those games.

Admittingly, I was looking for some cheaper games at first for my PS3, and I would probably never have bought this game otherwise.  Still I wanted to give it a try.

The graphics/cutscenes are the best part of this game, as they should be on a PS3 system.  The gameplay pretty much borrows from its predecessors (complete puzzle, having to use a specific character, complete specific tasks, mash this button, etc).  You can find many other games (the Ratchet and Clank series, for one) that does what Prince Caspian tries to do much, much better.

Graphics:  9/10  You'll definitely feel like you're in the movie with the graphics, for better or worse

I liked the things that were added...a dog for your companion and other features.  Minus the occasional freezing of the game or so I thought.  That is until it happened again a hour or two later.  At first I thought it was my 360 but all my other games play fine on it.  So i popped it back in and started ""trying"" to play again.  This time is just loaded and froze...tried one more time and the same deal.  It loads and the game just freezes and that's all that I can seriously take with Fable 2.  I truly enjoyed the first game and was looking forward to this one so much I bought the Limited Edition for it despite the warnings otherwise.

I've never just stopped playing a game and given up because of glitches/bugs.  Shoddy gameplay or a weak story perhaps.  But i've never had issues like I have with this game and after I waited this long to finally get around and play Fable 2.  It makes me even more frustrated and upset over the company for releasing a game that wasn't ready to be put out.  It's cool about putting out a patch and what not.  But that would not be necessary if they simply put the game out like it should've been minus the sorry and game ending glitches.

As it stands I enjoyed what i played of the game but not after the issues I've experienced.  Fable 2 will go right back on the shelf of gams I don't touch anymore.  I'll find something else worth my time because this one isn't it.

However, it almost always freezes your game and kicks you back to the dashboard (the 360 version will just freeze your entire system, needing full reboot) without saving your stats in-game. My first round I had a 21 kill streak and two level-ups when the game froze. Those stats were lost forever.

You can no longer join a match with your friends already in a squad. You have to navigate through the menus instead and hope you can join the same server (again, good luck, they almost never work. You'll get ""No Commander Slots Available,"" ""Server Full,"" ""Need an update,"" etc. even though the server details say otherwise). The gameplay is very nice, though still fairly buggy, just as BF3 was at release. But at least that game could run through many rounds without freezing and shutting down. I don't have a hard time getting kills in multiplayer, but there are times when the game seems to display other players in different locations than they really are. Result: killed from around a corner, killed with one shot, missed headshots with sniper rounds, knifing at air, etc..

DICE and EA are taking a major hit for the terrible quality and instability of this game. It was clearly pushed out months ahead of schedule in order to make the holiday lineup and compete with COD: Ghosts. I'm not a big fan of COD, but at least it's pretty stable. If you buy this game, good luck telling DICE or EA how unhappy you are with it. They already did a double XP week (a total joke consider how hard it is to finish a match and keep your score), so you only have a few months of waiting before they'll actually fix this game. Wait for it, then buy it. I'm sure in six months this will be a great game.

The main characters are not the main characters of the Lord of the Rings, but rather similar characters that share many connections with them. Berethor is the captain of the Gondor Citadel Guard, and is looking for Boromir. Idrial is an elf woman serving Galadriel. Elegost is one of Aragorn's fellow rangers. And so on for the other three characters; all are made in the shape of other, similar characters. Their activities and encounters all follow the Fellowship, even at one point finding the campsite used by them when in the mountains (in the first film). The objectives are usually tantalizingly close to the fellowship - ""Oh, that's our campsite, yeah, so come find us in the Mines of Moria! Oh, wait, we moved on."" Gandalf narrates the scenes ""speaking"" to Berethor, usually encouraging him to try and catch up with the group. Many of the game's boss fights are against non-canon enemies, enemies the Fellowship dealt with (supposedly), or enemies that it wouldn't make sense to have killed. As a whole, the story appears more like a fanfiction than a professional work.

The gameplay is reminiscent of most RPGs. Characters have HP and MP (or, rather, AP), and various class-specific skills. They can fight, use skills, use magic, or use items. Items tend to be LOTR-specific things like Lembas bread or Kingsfoil. Most of the attacks in the beginning are simply ""hit harder"" or ""hit harder against certain things"", but this later evolves into magical abilities as well. For the most part, the system is uninspired and not particularly exciting. The characters run around on the world map and have old-style random encounters that pop out of nowhere. The majority of the battles are fairly boring and have nothing to set them apart.

The graphics are fairly terrible. The textures are blocky, the characters seem mis-proportioned, the animations are odd and unnatural, and everything seems to be blurry for some reason. The voice acting is decent, but not spectacular; the characters seem chosen, again, for their resemblance to established characters.

As a whole, this game has nothing going for it. It seems amateur in many ways, and isn't particularly fun, either. Even for fans of LOTR, this isn't that rewarding because of the many inaccuracies and oddities present.

After playing two other Ninja Theory releases, ""Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"" (2010) and the reboot ""DmC Devil May Cry"" (2013), I journeyed into their back-catalog and picked up ""Heavenly Sword"" (2007) for very cheep price and felt compelled to try it soon after getting it in the mail.  I put it in and the game starts with a flourish, as the main character is all alone on a huge battlefield strewn with fallen warriors, with a massive horde coming straight for her as you are forced to fight as a short tutorial before she ultimately succumbs to the superior numbers.  Right on!  Cool!  A short cut-scene later and you are back into it with swarming enemies...and then the game falls apart.  The combat is highly repetitive, with only a few decent combos that get old quickly.  The camera is partially fixed, with you being able to pan right or left, but with little control beyond that as you frequently lose track of enemies as they 'sneak-attack' you.  The frame rate also drops off, with dialogue timing coming a fraction of a second too late for the animation.  After this left me crestfallen, then commences a sequence where your fire a crossbow at approaching enemies with six-axis control.  For those who do not know what 'six-axis' control is...you can control the flight of the bolt by tilting your controller up or down or sideways to change the trajectory.  This might sound fun but it is a serious problem, and I would have preferred fixed aiming like so many other shooting games, as the six-axis control made me feel like an even worse shot than usual.  This really does feel like an early PS3 game, with simple, repetitive combat, and some wonky control issues that other games have tried and also abandoned long ago.  This game has achieved slight 'cult' status over the years, but I think it may be more out of nostalgia for its time.  ""Heavenly Sword"" has not aged well.  After playing and loving the other two aforementioned Ninja Theory releases this one falls flat.  I highly recommend ""Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"" and ""DmC Devil May Cry"" for much more exhilarating experiences.  The gameplay in both is vastly superior, and the story for ""Enslaved"" is one of the best I have encountered.

2.0,False,"04 25, 2012",ALT8OCGC2LVQ9,B005NH6NMY,Paul Mosier,"This racing wheel is quite obviously not the top of the line, not even an entry level wheel. It's more like a toy version of a real one. It has a few redeeming qualities: price, decent build quality, button layout and surprisingly precise steering but that's where it ends. The pedals are so small and close together that I wouldn't recommend anyone over 12 trying to use this seriously.

Wheel 6 of 10
The actual wheel is not that bad, albeit a little small. It should be about 2-4 inches wider to be a full sized racing wheel. There is true force feedback, which is pretty weak so don't get excited. But it's there. Steering is very close to realistic, when you turn, the car turns and the wheel springs back when you let go. I believe they are using a spring and heavy bearing setup to counteract the weak force feedback. In other words it adds to the force feedback motor by always trying to adjust to the center of the alignment. And that's where you run into the main problem behind the wheel, so to speak. After about a half hour of racing with 6-8 different cars ranging from a little sub-compact up to a full Le Mans car it was apparent they messed something up. When you have the camera outside the car and you attempt to go around a just a curve (not a turn) or even slight change in direction, the wheel keeps pulling you back to straight. I'm almost certain the wheel is out of alignment. In other words you have to constantly correct as you're turning making the car basically weave instead of corner. You might say, ""Wow that seems realistic."" It isn't. Take it from a mechanical engineer and avid car enthusiast who has always owned sports cars; there is a fine art to getting the wheel to seem like it's fighting back. And this one doesn't do it correctly. If you were to sum it up, it just feels strange.

Pedals 2 of 10
These are without a doubt the reason one wouldn't buy this racing wheel, even at the price. Maybe this was built for a toddler, maybe it was built for a ""little person."" But it wasn't built for an adult. The pedals sit on a 6 x 6 in square of plastic and each one is about the size of a credit card. They function but for the most part are just a couple pieces of plastic with a spring underneath. I had to remove my shoes and have my feet touching each other to get them to work. And I'm average height etc. If you can get past this problem, this wheel is decent. Otherwise, adult males (in other words anyone who's gone through puberty) should steer clear. Sorry, more car puns.

Button Layout 8 of 10
I was very impressed with the button layout of the wheel. The left and right bumpers are easily reached with your thumbs and the analog clicking motion is completed with the other button directly beneath the LB and RB.  The rest of the buttons including D-pad, X, Y, A, B, and Xbox button are located just as you'd find them on a regular controller. There are also paddle shifters on the back which work great. They're already mapped to do the shifting so you don't have to mess around with any of that. If HORI fixes the other problems, this is the thing to base their next wheel off of. My only issue is the pedals, which I consider part of the button layout. So unfortunately the pedal predicament bleeds into the layout.

Build Quality 5 of 10
It's hard to quantify this when you haven't used the wheel that long, so it's more like initial build quality. For sheer feeling, the buttons feel pretty solid, especially the paddle shifters. The wheel has stiffness and an accurate translation to the game. But, the pedals again are just complete junk. I think I could make better pedals myself. And then there is the issue with the wheel alignment which is likely mechanical. So I suppose that evens out the build quality. In other words, everything seems good at the beginning but I'd be worried about it in the future.

Conclusion
For kids who play stuff like Need for Speed and the like, this wheel could be great. It gives people who have never driven a car the chance to act like they're out on the open road. If you're an adult or play racing simulators, this isn't going to work. I owned the MS official one and that is better or even a Madcatz type. I cannot emphasize enough just how small the pedals are.

There is waaaaaay too much exposition and way too many extended cut scenes with so much background and this and that and . . . blah! Just let me play the friggin game already!  Then, right when you get used to the controls, WHAMMO! No more weapons, just a knife and have fun getting killed six times while you learn to use it .

The layout of the maps is linear to the point of feeling like a rail shooter, which works great when you're actually on rails ( souped up train car thing), but feels limiting and uncreative while traveling on foot.

The crescendo events are really just gobs and gobs of the same enemy owning your face to the point of stupidity. This makes the game feel less tactically challenging and more technically challenging, in other words; can you aim, reload, use a med kit, and shoot fast enough to not die.

2.0,False,"03 6, 2012",AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B00647630Y,Bryan W,"Titles that end a series, or that never receive a warranted follow-up, are often looked back upon fondly. 2K Sports has several of those in their past catalog alone.

MLB 2K12 will not be joining them in high-regard. What 2K Sports has produced is a game that makes it apparent the end is near and it's clear that the company has no further plans for baseball considering how little effort was put forward.

Of course, seeing framerate issues after the very first pitch, watching a Carlos Zambrano scene just minutes later where he stands in an awkward stance after a home run the whole time, and having a position player literally on the mound in the half inning after pinch hitting (despite selecting a pitcher to take his place) is going to have some influence on later evaluations. It's not as though oddities are witnessed every inning but when they do appear they're impossible to overlook. It all just started things rolling in the wrong direction particularly because the focus this year supposedly was on fixing lingering issues and providing a more authentic ""looking"" game.

There are a number of weird animations and scenes that play out and that really affects what immersive nature the title is seeking to achieve. Players walk and run funny, spin in circles, face the wrong direction, speed up like they are being fast-forwarded, slow down like they are in slo-motion, and those are just some of the observations off the top of my head. Handling outfielders is also especially difficult - there's a hesitation when first taking control and they don't tend to settle into the spot where the ball is coming down. That makes most routine catches look like circus ones. Infielders sometimes have trouble getting the ball out in time rather playing out an animation first. Most worrisome are the times where they casually pick up the ball and then toss it to the wrong base (seen that with catchers a few times and a second baseman once).

The graphics are unquestionably the worst amongst the crop of major sports titles. Even if that was the only weakness to the series it's inexcusable to look so bad. Player faces seem to have been made slightly better this year but otherwise the visuals are arguably worse all around. That the framerate can still be an issue when the visuals are so poor makes it even more embarrassing. Even touches like grass stains on the uniforms come with a caveat - I've had my team actually start the first inning with big stains already present. It's just an ugly game to look at despite its decent presentation package.

Last year MLB 2K11 had a certain fun factor about it, very good commentary and presentation as well, but those positives were wrecked by how bug-riddled it was along with disastrous CPU AI. Things have improved, though marginally so, on this front. For some reason of which I'm having trouble putting a finger on why exactly that fun factor hasn't really carried over as much as I had anticipated it would if many of those issues had been ironed out. The desire to play 2K12 began to dissipate almost immediately.

The new focus on tendencies and confidence is interesting and makes for a better strategic batter-pitcher battle. That pitches lose effectiveness and the CPU begins looking for them when overused (or when getting knocked around) makes for a much more organic struggle and more of a challenge. They push it a bit too much in the commentary though. While it's valuable to hear what the pitcher has been doing the focus on it becomes a little tiring.

Hit variety has been decent but, and this may be due to the analog hitting where there is a small window for it, I've seen very few balls pulled or taken the other way. It may just be sample size though so no declaration on this yet. I also have yet to hit a single home run and that again could be due to sample size or fault of my own. In previous years though I've hit a fair number of them in early play. I do like the new way bunting is handled in having to actually put the bat on the ball rather than having it done for you.

The other notable gameplay change has to do with the throw meter which has been made extra sensitive - errors are much more prevalent from the user controlled side of things. The window to make a good throw is slim. My first instinct was to make ""safe"" throws when not actually needing to rush them but those safe throws are now considered dangerous too which I found to be a somewhat odd design decision.

Though I've only simmed through Franchise mode (with the A's winning the World Series) a few things to note. Fatigue seems to be fixed in that players do deal with having lower energy levels (last year they reset after a simmed game), there were a decent amount of injuries during sims (don't know how many will happen when playing those games), and the post-season atmosphere doesn't feel special enough. 2K does deserve credit for not just getting in the new 10 team playoff structure but also the new tie-breaker game for teams locked atop the division at the end of the season.

The big change to My Player mode is bringing in player ""roles"" which help to define the type of player being built. There are a good variety to choose from and the ratings are structured to encourage their style of play. In my case I chose ""Slugger"" and started off rated 58 with 45 contact and 60 power. Otherwise the mode seems to be largely the same as before. Base running is a tedious chore, training drills can't be skipped, and when in the field the throw controls are reversed - this despite a diagram that pops up on screen that seems to suggest otherwise.

More time needs to be spent with online play before adding that to the evaluation.

Let me start by saying the story is horrible, a sad mix of poorly written, corny old English dialog and distractingly bad voice acting. Without a solid story to move the game along, there's not a lot left.
Most of the game you will spend fighting. Every monster is pretty much the same, as they are either ranged or melee. Besides timing the dodge key, there isn't much skill associated with fighting, and while it might be fun for a while, it quickly gets old. Further, magic seems underpowered for the most part, so you'll likely be forced into swords or bows.
The sidequests aren't much better than the main quest, if at all. None of them really leap out at you are all pretty generic. There's no real scripting that gets put into these quests, so they are all of the ""find and kill"" or ""find and retrieve"" variety.
As mentioned in other reviews, riding a horse is woefully bad. The horse having its own AI is a novel concept, sure, but poorly implemented and absolutely annoying. I found myself walking more often than not, just to spare myself the trouble.
The morality system is also lacking. Sure, you have a ""reputation"" in various areas, but you never really feel that the game even recognizes your evil deeds. Your character just seems to act in accordance to where he is and who he is talking to. While you do have choices, the ethics system is not very good and leaves you feeling that being good or evil doesn't really matter.
With no good story, painfully bad voice acting and dialog, and poorly written, generic sidequests, what is good about this game?
The graphics are nice, though poorly optimized it seems and a step behind its competitors. Make sure you update your video drivers. Also, the teleport system is handy and spares you from the drudgery of having to walk/ride everywhere.

I don't care for single player games, and so having a good headset is crucial. I thought the Microsoft Orig. headset would be sufficient, but I was left wanting in BOTH copies that I purchased

DESIGN/FUNCTION
Let's talk about how well (or not) this thing works. As far as I have been told, the microphone sounds clear and picks up my voice quite well. It is also quite good at blocking out background noise. The headphone part of it, however, leaves much to be desired. With full volume in all settings, I still struggle to hear people who I am assured are speaking in a normal voice. This bugs me, especially with the sound effects from in game loud enough to drown out instructions or that crucial ""There are two coming up the stairs behind you"" message.

BUILD/QUALITY
I am also not impressed with the build of these headsets. The plastic is cheap, and although flexible, I am always worried about breaking these (which has happened in the past). The foam over the headphone is cheap and not all that comfortable. Also only people with very small heads will find this comfortable out of the box.

Most battles are a breeze; you easily win every battle by doing simple combos and timing your defense well.  However, when it comes to bosses the game becomes unnecessarily difficult and frustrating.  Boss fights are overly hard for absolutely no reason.  The bosses are so powerful that you can't approach them head on like 99% OF THE REST OF THE GAME, forcing you to use the frustrating other parts of the combat system such as ""free run.""  Free run allows you to walk anywhere on the battle field, not just forward and backward.  On Xbox360 you have to hold Left Trigger to use Free Run.  This allows you to dodge attacks but it is so annoying to have to press another button just to move freely.  And you MUST use free run on bosses because they are too overpowered so you can't use defense.  This forces you to play a certain way, and that's no fun.

The AI will cause you to lose boss battles numerous times.  I was fighting one of the first bosses in the game where there are plants that are on the battlefield that stun an area around them when you attack them.  They don't actually attack or are considered enemies (because you don't have to defeat them to win).  However, the RETARDED AI spent the entire battle ATTACKING THEM, STUNNING HIMSELF and then we died.  Not to mention all AI characters will just stand in the line of fire until they die, including magic casters.  This makes some boss battles almost impossible for me to beat.

I'm very upset because the story seemed kind of fun, although a little shallow.  The characters felt natural and the dialogue was good.  I want to continue the story, but I can't stand the gameplay...  Unfortunately I think I'll have to quit without finishing.

The good( some may be in previous more recent total war titles as well):

*The best thing i noticed is the nice graphics both for the campaign map and the battle maps. The sea battle maps and ships are stunning to look at. The normal battle maps have a lot of detail.

*Naval Battles now are actually naval battles. You can control the ships on a sea map just like the armies on a land map.

* More Theaters of action. 3 theaters is a nice addition.

* Various other minor enhancements

Cons:

* My biggest problem is probably with Steam. It is required to play the game regardless of if you buy the digital or retail box. After the 15 GB install which is  still rather slow on even my high end pc i had to wait about 5 hours(@100 kb/s average speed) for manadatory patching through Steam, rather than including a simple autopatcher with the game like most decent game publishers do. I could not play it without this lengthy patching. Also i dislike Steam for a couple of reasons: A) i consider it to be malware. I am forced to use it to play the game and it does gather info from your pc. I am not for sure exactly all what it gathers but considering i am forced to have it on my pc to use the game  it makes me not trust steam at all on their data gathering. And B) off a retail box game at full price ( usually $50) their is 15% profit for the developer/publisher. Off a Steam Download which charges the same full retail price, that profit margin  is 60%!. So by using steam these publishers get mega profits and we customers get mega ripped off.

* Playing medieval total war then this, the game land battles seem harder to control. Both on the camera( i have changed my camera settings several times to try to correct the feel) and the units themselves.

* The Sea battles are not that easy to control. Sometimes the ships  won't do what they are told the first time. Also wind plays a major factor in manuevering and it seems to be working against you and for the AI  most of the time.  Overall the sea battles are ok and still a nice addition though.

* Many things are simplified  from  MTW such as city building, research, and various details that use to be available on your ""leaders"" from the king down to the leader of a group of units. Much of this has been done away with.

* Modders had to create mods to make up for the developers lack of putting out a complete game. even after the patches the game wasn't all it should of been. Modders fixed the AI, made various things more realistic, and added some enhancements. things the developer should  of done. I highly recommend Darthmod  if you play empire total war.

* some of the text is hard to read and blurry. Changing my resolution or settings does not seem to effect this.

Neutral:

*It is reported that the game is buggy and crashes a lot. I have never had it crash in 20 hours of play. I don't notice any major bugs so far  though it does sometimes feel a bit unfinished and rushed out the door.

* This game can be a resource hog. So on lower end pcs you may have some performance issues.

*the city building is more simpilified. Now your focus is the region capital  and  various little settlements pop up and grow in a region  as you progress.  You actually watch the land in the game ""grow up"". While this is interesting it leaves less to manage( and to alter your income) early in the game. So its really a trade off. What you build in the cities now seems more simple. Their is not actually a lot of building and  at various points you have choices of following  different ""trees"" of buildings(ie: shipyards or trade port?). It adds a twist but does take other elements away from the game.

* their are some nice ""defensive"" features but they don't seem to work well. they had great potentional but kind of fell short. They are still  playable and whatnot but could of been better.

Overall: If you player previous total war games you are probably going to be a bit disappointed. the graphics and sea battles are going to be the biggest change( besides the forced steam use). Its alright but nothing like the TWs you have played as far as gameplay.

If you are new to the TW series i recommend starting with earlier  and better versions. This title really doesnt do the series justice and is a poor example of a game from the series.

For reference my pc specs: Intel i7 -8xx series, 8 GB DDR 3 Ram, 1 GB nvidia GT220  video card, 7.1 surround sound, 1 TB raid 0 HDD. I can play the game on ultra settings without darthmod and on high settings with darthmod though large battles are a bit laggy using darthmod in large battles on  very high settings.

With a passing interest in truck driving, tycoon genre, and/or simulation, 18 Wheels of Steel fans (who might be disappointed with the way Extreme Trucking direction went and for those looking for something more than American Long Haul) may see this as a challenge to the truck driving sims namely the 18 Wheels of Steel franchise. It's  a different take on a business sim/trucking game. I was a fan of all the 18 Wheels of Steels games with the exception of Extreme truckers ( because of its new direction which I didn't like) and Big City Rigs which was just god-awful!

Rig n Roll was billed as a truck driving sim tycoon game taking place only in the state of California with one city in Nevada. You are a truck driver for a company that you own.  You choose what to haul as there are different types of goods ranging from fruit to cars. You start off with a basic rig that you can upgrade. At your company, you can also tradein your truck for a much better one.  For the most part, all of this takes place in California. On a side note, it looks like Las Vegas (in Nevada) might be added in the Fall as some billboards on the freeways are hinting. The Rignroll, website still hasn't been updated since the game was released. This drives me insane as I would like to know if there are any updates and possible add-ons. You have to dig to find out that Las Vegas is in the works but no release date has been set. The graphics look very nice. The billboards look nice and realistic as do the roads also. You even have to play a toll at the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge; nice touch! I think I read when this game was in development, the game designers/developers went to California and mapped out the roads and drew the scenery. The developers of Wildlife Park 2 did the same thing (obviously at a zoo instead). Very nice! There is an interesting storyline in RignRoll with some interesting twists and turns. I won't divulge on it because I don't want to spoil it!

The graphics are very nice. I would say, better than the 18 WoS franchise. The streets, freeways, interstates look good. The map is not a good tool as it's not helpful (not useless, just not helpful. In 18 WoS; the map was terrific. In RnR,  I found myself on dead ends which the map never hinted to. The same issue in 18 WoS Haulin and American Long Haul persists in Rig n Roll; empty cities with no people. There is a glaring omission in RnR. I cannot understand, comprehend, or understand why! WHERE ARE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS? A game with nice graphics and designers who drive around California to map out the land, you would expect the traffic lights (as well as different types/shapes). I couldn't believe it. This makes for interesting intersections. No stop signs either. The rigs are nice and lifelike. A nice touch is when you go to a gas station (press enter when there) you get out of your rig and pump (as well as use a slider to either fill it up or as much as you want). The downside is that you have no control of your character, it's automatic. You can customize your rig (paint, engine, brakes, wheels, etc. The only place to accept a job is in the warehouse. Your company must have a contract with the warehouse you are at, or else you can't start a job such as hauling a harvester, rocket fuel etc. Some jobs involves you being in a race to a designated city (warehouse). Usually it's against 4 other rigs (the AI). When you reach the border (fence) of a warehouses, it is automated (very disappointing to see). You watch the rig (with or without cargo) automatically be driven into the warehouse and a crane automatically unhooks your load. Why can't I drive in the warehouse, perhaps get out, and use a crane to unhook my load? When you pick your job, the load is automatically placed on your rig and you are automatically driven out. You have to be careful, because when you reach the boundary of the warehouse you are on your own and sometimes if you aren't paying attention you could quickly crash. By the way, if you crash, there are nice visuals of your rig taking damage. Your rig looks hurt! Also, why in the world is there a key for, unhooking or hooking your load? You don't even get to attach (or detach) it to your rig. If you crash and your trailer falls off, that's one reason. Also, from time to time, you might get a phone call asking you to pick up a trailer. On your jobs screen, it does tell you how to get to your destination.

The traffic is nice. Strange that California is known for it's traffic, yet it seems very quiet in the game, no matter what time of the day that it is. To get the true California traffic, you need to move the traffic slider all the way right (yes there is a slider for traffic in the menu. The day/night timing is a nice touch. The police are weird. If you commit a infraction, it seems like the police always try to run you off the road, however, if you slow down, you get pulled over and arrested....almost always. I did drive on the wrong side of the road not knowing a police cruiser was behind me and I was ticketed. So that's good, not everytime is an arrest :) Driving is more real in RnR than the 18 WoS series. But, at least in the 18 WoS series, you back up at your destination and unload your cargo. In RnR, you either go to a designated spot (along the road) and unhook the trailer (while going (under 10mph) or reach the warehouse where you rwach the warehouse border and it's completely automated.

All and all, this is game is about 2.7 stars. You wonder with it in development for so long, you think, ""this is it?"" If this game improves, I would change this rating (simply by erasing this review and redoing it. As of right now, the best thing to do is to try the demo first. There is no life in the cities and when you reach your destination, it's pretty much automated; everything is almost automated. It is a nice touch to be able to get out of  your truck and go into a diner, pump gas, fix your truck, and go to a motel. The only problem is that all of this is automated. you have no control (you have the option to fill as much gas as you need in your rig; it's a slider). The truck stops are nice but they are devoid of any action/people/other trucks in real time. At the truckstop, you can go into the diner and find work in the newspaper. When you play this game, you'll feel like this could of been a hit but it is a miss. Maybe in the future, if this game is supported, it could be a hit. Right now, it's got a lot of options to grow on and hopefully, it's supported. If you love truck sims, try the demo first. It might seem terrible at first, then it grows on you. I'm very close to erasing this review and upping the rating to about 3 stars although, as I said before, it's not quite there. If it's true, Las Vegas will be added, I will see how that goes as well as if anything else is added, ie. fixes, updates etc.

+Cities don't all look the same
+Traffic is more realistic during the times of the day

+Story mode is interesting
+Tutorial is nice
+Dolby Surround sound is nice
+ Guess what? When you drive up to a toll booth; you have to pay!

+The radio is a nice touch; music actually isn't bad. I was tired of hearing,"" Anyone got the 10-13??"" (from 18 WoS)
+ How fellow employees, businesses contact you and the talking business is a nice touch
+ The animation when filling your tank, going to the motel, getting something to eat, fixing/upgrading your truck is nice as is the animation of how your truck looks if you get into a crash
+ steering is more realistic
+shifting/use of clutch/going in reverse is more realistic
+ The truck stops are nice
+ Besides going to the warehouse, you can go to a truckstop and get out of your truck to go into a bar/diner to find jobs in the newspaper.

- I've been to several cities and I have seen absolutely no traffic signals. California with no traffic signals???? Very careless.
-The cities are void of people.
- Reaching your destination, at the warehouse is automated. You don't back your rig to the loading/unloading zone. When you reach the border of the warehouse, you are automatically taken in, point and click what you want to haul, and the trailer is automatically attacked to your rig.
-sometimes when your task sends you to a specific location (not the warehouse), the directions are very vague. Sometimes you have to pick up the trailer on the side of a freeway but you will not know specifically where until it pops up on the right side of your screen.
- Would be nice if you can actually drop off goods and pick up goods at the seaport and airport.
-Realism- No speed limit signs on the freeway
- The journal, info screen is not very helpful
- Would be nice to be able to control your character: pumping fuel, washing your rig, sleeping in a motel, talking to other truckers at a diner/restaurant, unloading/loading trailers in the warehouse or pickup point.
- Sometimes you can get arrested for what seems to be minor infractions",Could of been a hit!,1282176000,32,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

3.0,False,"11 19, 2007",A254O5PCXMW7NM,B000Q8XK30,one who knoas,"This is a single player review of WIC.

Its hard to understand the glowing reviews this game has gotten.  Its a respectable RTS in the sense that it works as intended by the designers.  Unfortunately, the design is seriously flawed.

Lets start with the story elements.  The game starts out well, and indeed the story is more or less solid.  You defend the US west coast from Soviet invasion, and in between doing that you flash back to battles you have fought in the ongoing war with the USSR in Europe.  So far, so good.

Where the game narrative falls apart is in the characters.  You have your CO, a Colonel, who barks orders at you.  He's a reasonable if aggressive leader, and while he seems to bark out new orders every minute at least he is believable.  Unfortunately, your colliegues are not.  First is Major Bannon, who commands armor assets that occasionally provide you with support.  The first rule of character design is Thou Shalt Not Annoy.  Alas, Bannon is the Jar Jar Binks of WIC.  His voice is annoying.  He is ungrateful when you save his butt.  He talks back to his superior officers.  He questions orders, always, and complains about them.  He disobeys orders routinely, and through negiigence and dereliction of duty kills high ranking liason officers and civilians.  Did I mention his voice is whiney and annoying?  He ruins the game.  In the real military he would never make Major, in fact he would never make it past 2nd Lieutenant.  Military officers are among the toughest, most squared away people on the planet.  They have to be.  Minor mstakes are career ending.  Major mistakes get you imprisoned.  Yet this whiny, girllish Bannon persists through most of the game.  Disobeyed orders and killed civilians and allied soldiers?  Well - the story goes -  the Colonel gave him a dirty look as punishment.  As if.  In the military of 60 years ago he would have been executed by firing squad.  Today he would be imprisoned.  In this game he will command troops and annoy you for the next 10 missions.

Thankfully, Bannon gets relieved of duty, but his replacement is more of the same, minus the whiny voice.  Who knew that the job of an junior officer in combat is to second guess, undermine, and put down his CO instead of - say - actually carrying out orders and accomplishing the mission?  Its obvious that the developers never had any military advisors working with them.  The game is an insult to the military.  This is a strategy game and you should recognise that your customers might just have served and cannot stand - cannot stand - your depiction of officers as whiny babies who cannot get the job done.  In my experience the average company-grade officer in a combat arms unit is tough, smart as hell, brave beyond measure, iron-willed and tasked with a job so difficult that many civilians would whimper at the responsibilty and power they wield.  Imagine that the next time you screw up at work fully a tenth of your coworkers are killed outright, or some high number of innocents are dead.  Thats the pressure they work under.  Show some respect.  They earn half what the developers of this game make.

This may seem like an overly pro-military critique but the thing to understand is how these characters totally undermine the immersion of the game.  Simply put, the story is DOA for not taking the military seriously, and instead offers up a charicature that probably jives with the designers pop-culture sensibilites, without them even realizing it.  Even of you think this would not annoy you, read on.  Narrative is only one of several big problems with the game.

Now that immersion is circling the toilet bowl, lets look at gameplay.  Unfortunately, its tedious.  You start missions with some good sized maps, and apparently the designers were so impressed with themselves that they feel that you must visit every inch of them.  Every few minutes you're ordered to rush across the map to a new objective.  You are whipped around the map without reprieve.  In between you will be tasked with secondary objectives that - you guessed it - whip you around to even further flung corners of the map.  By the end I couldn't stand the Colonel or anyone else in the game.  I literally felt like I was playing VirtuaTennis with my units as the ball.

Taking an objective means camping some areas on the map, holding ground.  Too bad these areas are spread out and wildly exposed.  Want to take this area by setting some infantry up in the woods meters away?  No chance.  They must be parked out in the open where they can be cut down.  This wouldn't be so bad except you must simultaneously hold 3 or 4 such areas, and they are just far enough apart to prevent any kind of interlocking fields of fire.  They might as well be on opposite sides of the map.  This, primarily, is how the game introduces difficulty, since the units are powerful and easy to keep alive, especially infantry, which are amazing death merchants.  Two antitank squads in proper cover can crush a massive armor invasion far better than any two tanks could, so the designers decided the best way to prevent that is to make you spread them out.  The final mission takes this to such heights I was laughing to myself when I saw it.

The other glaring fault is the dependence on support fires.  Throughout the vast majority of the game you can call in huge amouts of artillery and other support fires to obliterate your opponent.  While this is a fun for a bit, eventually it becomes clear that support fires are at least as effective as all your units combined, and you end up spending a lot of your time calling in fires instead of - you know - moving your units strategically in real time.

All in all this game is a major letdown.  Company of Heroes is vastly superior in every way.  It is more strategic, the missions are better designed, the voice acting is better, and it respects the men it simulates.  The gaming press cannot be trusted.  There is no way this should have got 90%+ from most of the top reviewers.  I give it a 60% only because it looks nice, controls well and is free from major bugs.",Design problems,1195430400,14,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Its like waiting for santa to come down the chimney to give you a toy, but instead gives you a pile of crap.

The reason i gave it a low rating, was because this game did NOT CONCENTRATE on Yuna's mission. It barely explained anything. Yuna was ALWAYS distracted, someone was always in trouble, someone always needed her to do something, she was always in some kind of tournament or running errands. I mean this game should have been called ""Final Fantasy X-2: Sidequest"", becuase 80% of the game was just sidequests, had NOTHING to do with the storyline.

Yuna goes through a HUGE transformaton. she goes from this goodie two shoe I-must-follow-the-teachings-of-Yeavon down to earth Summoner, to this pop-singing, skin-revealing Sphere Hunter, she hopes to find these spheres that would explain why her beloved Tidus disappears or maybe hopes to find him again. She's more energetic, she's still loved by the people, you may encounter a few who believer her fame days are over and won't even bother giving her the special treatment.

The reason i say her missions barely have anything to do with the story is becuase she finds all these spheres and almost everyone of them is a disappointment accept one she found in Kilika of Shuyin. THAT sphere was a pretty good one, why couldn't they find more spehere like that one?

I wanted to know more about Shuyin, I wanted to Know more about Lenne and WHY they had such a strong connection to Yuna and Tidus, besides the dressphere she wore. They should have gave Yuna another dream where she woke up as Lenne and had the story shift into THEIR time and see how their lives were portrayed. I really wanted to know just STUFF about them, how did they meet! how did Lenne do in battle?

They do introduce some new characters such as Paine, LeBlanc, Logos, Ormi, Barilai, Nooj and Gippal. It would be nice if they made a seperate game for Baralei, Nooj and Gippal.

YOu can revist some places from the first Series and even speak to the same characters. the music wasn't really all that great, the moonflow song made me want to go crazy.

The inclusion of the DC characters was a good idea. There are two story modes, one for the DC universe and one for MK universe. The animation and graphics are good, as is the voice acting. At the successful completion of each story mode you unlock a new character, though neither one is very good. The story itself is mediocre, but honestly I'm not sure what else they could have done that would have even remotely made sense.
The game definitely scaled back on violence and gore. There is a little blood and uniform ripping, but overall, the violence is muted (compared to some previous versions) and the fatalities are mostly lame.
The arcade mode is same old, same old. You can continue unlimited times both in arcade and story mode, making the game fairly easy to beat. You can also change your character as you go through arcade mode. You unlock an ending for whatever character you're using when you beat the final boss. Unfortunately these endings only consist of a picture and about 15 seconds of spoken words. Many of them are not very good or are just confusing. Longer endings with some animation would have been much better.
The MK games including this one still have numerous problems. The arcade system is getting really old school and needs to improved.  This game like all MK games favors button mashing.

You walk around and explore, talk to people, collect objects and clues, and solve puzzles.  I'm a big fan of these types of games, but if you're not as a rule, I would skip this.

As a long-time adventure gamer, I was waiting for the Wii release to play this game.  If you've already played it on PC, don't bother.  It's exactly the same.  The Wii controls are barely used, and when they are it's kinda annoying.

This game definitely has its flaws.  It's not a great game.  The action is pretty slow and sometimes repetitive.  It's not exciting or unpredictable (especially if you've read the book, which I have.)  The game is actually not very linear, in that you can do a lot of optional actions and you can do things at different times.

The gameplay for the most part is basic. You try to press the correct buttons with the correct timing. Mostly you are using the x, circle, square and triangle buttons, but occasionally a directional button will be thrown in, which adds to the challenge immensely. You are auditioning to be one of Britney's backup dancers by dancing off against other dancers. You go through ten auditions before being allowed to audition against Britney herself. After each audition, you are awarded points based on your performance. These points eventually reward you with ""backstage passes"" that allow you to see video clips of Britney.
The one innovative gameplay element that I like about this game is that when your competitor does well, he or she can make your moves harder. Every time your opponent strings a combo of ten button presses together, it adds or changes your sequence. It may change one of your buttons, it may add a directional button, it may cause one of your button presses to be moved up or back, or it may add one or two extra button presses so that you have to hit ten buttons in rapid succession. Of course, by stringing together a combo of ten yourself, you do the same thing to your opponent. Although this can be infuriating at times, it at least adds some challange to an otherwise simple game.
I do have a few complaints about the game. First, it is too short and easy. You could play through the game with one dancer in a few hours easily, and through the entire game with all six dancers in a weekend. Therefore, I would just recommend this as a rental. Also, there are only five songs, and if you were not sick of hearing ""Oops...I did it again"" before, you will be after playing this game. My second complaint is that there should be a replay option. One problem with rhythm games is that while you are playing, you really cannot afford to look at what is going on because you have to be paying close attention to the meter. There should be a way to replay what you just did so you can watch all the moves that your dancer just did.
If you like rhythm games, try this as a rental. You just might find the gameplay very addictive. If you like rhythm games and you are also a fan of Britney's, you might just find this worth you money. But for serious gamers, Dance Beat really does not offer much depth.",Worth a Rental,1027123200,12,,

3.0,True,"07 27, 2017",A38TXTWBQ1VRI1,B00EO2ECUY,Ryan F,"As an owner of the original Naga Epic, I loved the mouse overall as it fit my hand pretty nicely. However, when it started getting the double click issue constantly after about 6 years, I knew it was time for a new one. This one is an improvement in some aspects but it hardly even feels like the Naga I was used to. The texture was definitely an improvement from the matte finish/glossy plastic sides of the original Naga and the textured grip on the right side of the mouse where your pinky would rest is a great addition.

However, this newer Naga is much larger than the original Naga and since I don't have very large hands, I find myself having to change my normal grip to comfortably reach all of the side buttons. With my normal grip, I pretty much cannot reach the 1, 2 or 3 buttons. There is also a big change in the buttons themselves. They feel much larger and I find that some of them have an angled position with the 5 and 8 buttons feeling as though they are raised more. The 1 and 10 buttons don't feel like they have any sort of angle to them either so there doesn't seem to be much consistency with them. The original Naga had the slight bumps under select buttons to give you a better idea of where your thumb was. That was done away with and now it seems the way to learn where your thumb is at first is to make note of the raised 5 and 8 buttons as a guide to work your thumb outward from each of those. It's not terrible but after using the original for so long, it will obviously take time getting used to something new to get that muscle memory refined for this mouse.

I feel like the sensor is a lot more jumpy than I am used to in normal use with browsing and things like that. I'm not entirely sure how else to explain it but it feels as though it is extremely sensitive and doesn't feel as accurate as I am used to with the previous Naga as well as the Deathadder Elite and Deathadder 3.5G before that. I'm not really sure what the issue is but it feels a little off to me. In MMO games (as it should be used for) the sensor doesn't matter as much since you will mostly be tab targeting or just having to click in a general area rather than precision clicks.

I have a slight issue with the outer sides of the mouse as well that involves the mouse buttons. On either side, the mouse button forms an odd and fairly sharp lip that extends from the very top outside corner of mouse 1 and 2 down to about where the top of the illuminated Razer logo is toward the center of the palm. I imagine it is to keep your finger from sliding off of the buttons but I would have liked to have seen slight grooves in mouse 1 and 2 that your fingers naturally fit into rather than completely flat buttons and these uncomfortable sharper lips.

The lighting (at least on my unit) is a little strange. The scroll wheel seems to never completely match the color on the keypad and logo. It is very slight but you can see it clearly on some colors more than others. For example, if you choose static white, the scroll wheel appears slightly bluish green compared to the lighting on the keypad and logo, which definitely just appear white. Orange looks a lot more dark than the other lights and pink looks more like a faint reddish white. It may just be a hardware issue and it's not a deal breaker by any means. It is just a bit of an annoyance whenever I do glance down and look at it.

There are definitely some improvements for bigger handed users compared to the original Naga/Naga Epic and the texture of the mouse feels very comfortable in the hand but just be aware if you are buying this as a replacement/upgrade to the original Naga that it will take some time getting used to and the only thing about this mouse that is keeping the Naga name is the Razer logo along with the 12 button keypad. It really doesn't feel much like the original Naga/Naga Epic but it is not necessarily a bad thing. It's not a definite good thing either though.

Overall, it does the job and I like it for what I need it for, which is MMO games. I wouldn't suggest getting this as your main mouse though, only as a mouse to use for MMO games or MOBAs if you like using the keypad instead of moving your fingers around more on the keyboard. I think if they improve the ergonomics mouse 1 and 2 by giving them more of slight grooves your fingers rest in, ditch the sharp lips on both outside parts of the mouse buttons and maybe make sure all of the keypad buttons have an angle that feels evenly distributed for comfort (rather than having some buttons be flat and some having a more aggressive angle) then I would say this would pretty much be a 5/5. However, the improvements mostly are in the button sizes and click feeling of the keypad. If it weren't for the pleasant texture covering the majority of the mouse, I wouldn't feel comfortable suggesting this to people. Although I'm not entirely sure the texture of the mouse, alone, is worth it anyway.

Not the worst mouse you could buy, of course, but I think some big steps should be taken in improving this in the next updated model of the mouse that will inevitably come at some point.

Edit: After using this for some time, the issues of not reaching the 1, 2 or 3 buttons have been solved by my grip changing over time from the muscle memory I have with my previous Naga, which was the original Epic. However, I still feel as though the buttons should have a better angled position, the scroll wheel is still pretty off-color from most colors that show on the numbers, themselves and the logo lighting. Essentially, everything I had a problem with beyond having an issue reaching 1, 2 and 3 buttons on the top row have been solved after using this mouse for a while.",Textured plastic feels great but some design choices have me scratching my head,1501113600,,"{'Size:': ' Mouse', 'Style:': ' MMO Wired'}",

This game is a monkey's paw. In that everything that seems great seems to have a giant negative caveat attached.

The game is BEAUTIFUL. Except for when it's being ugly at certain times and having massive dips in frame rate or cutscene animations that look so cheesy they make the graphics of the original Halo 1 look breathtaking.

The game gives you a jetpack and the freedom to explore in the BEGINNING of the game. And the world is MASSIVE. 4D exploration in a massive world. This is rare as most games that offer this do it in the middle or near the end of the game. The caveat to this open world exploration? Just be careful not to actually explore anywhere or you'll almost always get murked by something that's insanely overpowered for some reason. (And when it's not overpowered, it just feels that way because of these horrible combat mechanics - more on that below.) Think you can fly away out of danger? Lol no, even the beasts at the tutorial section of the game can shoot projectiles at you, and just about every other enemy the game has to offer does the same.

So speaking of combat, it's horrendous. There's no positive monkey's paw with a caveat attached there; it's just plain BAD. In fact, the combat is so horrendous that all the beauty this game has to offer can't hold a candle because the majority of the game will be spent in combat, and the majority of that combat will be godawful. Projectiles, magic, melee, etc. Everything, when it comes to combat, is a HUGE disappointment that if not fixed very soon will probably be the biggest cause of this game being dead by december.

Back to the monkey's paw: there's so many characters with so many ways to interact with them; but it all feels soulless and bland. I know our guy is supposed to be an alb or however that's spelled, but us, the players aren't. So when there's just emotionless interaction after emotionless interaction, my own investment in the character, the story, and the factions fighting for survival starts to wane.

One final part of the monkey's paw: I purchased the special edition of this game. And the packaging and materials included were BEAUTIFUL. The game itself doesn't feel like it's worth more than $30 and that's if I'm being generous. Before release I was comparing it to legends like Skyrim; now it feels more worthy of being compared to No Man's Sky from my perspective. A lot of exploration but nothing interesting to show for it because the other mechanics are muddling the potential this game has. I hope, like No Man's Sky, the developers see all the mixed and negative reviews as well (most of which have the same criticisms), take them with a grain of salt, and fix what's wrong with this game, because I really do believe this game has a lot of potential.

Do I regret my purchase and my investment in this game? For the moment, yes, I do. Do I have hope that the developers can still fix what is wrong and make this a worthy game for the end of 2017? Yes, I do.",Mixed Review - Take it with a grain of salt. It's a monkey's paw.,1508803200,14,"{'Edition:': ' Standard Edition', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

The ""bullet-time"" innovation is a great addition to the Third-person-shooter genre. It allows your character to overcome odds that are stacked against you without body armor or superhuman powers. You take out bad guys in slow motion with your uzis or twin berettas, watching bullets whiz past you while your shots find their home.  The shots that miss hit the wall, producing splinters, or they hit bottles or mirrors, shattering them to pieces.  Bullet time is the highlight of the game.  It never gets old.
But that's where the ""greatness"" ends.  The storyline is mediocre.  You just mow down the bosses lackeys, moving progressively on up the food chain until you kill the ""big boss"" at the end.  The game has good action but it has nothing besides that. There is only one way to solve every problem and most rooms have only one exit.  Go to room A, clear out the bad guys.  Go to room B, clear out the bad guys, etc, etc, etc.  There is no stealth whatsoever in this game.  The enemy AI has one setting -- ""always aware"".

You have a map with a small number of planets (14 on a small map, 20 on a medium map, 50 on a large map--I don't see how anyone would have time to play this on a large map), and it takes really LONG time for ships to move between these planets.

The thing you need to know about this game is that it's slow. There's nothing to do besides watch your ships fight it out. Battles can take forever. There's little strategy involved. Once you've figured out the best technology to research and best ships to build, there's really not much planning or thinking required.

The technology research is very generic. You research stuff that gives you more powerful shields and armor, more powerful weapons, or unlock new ships. On the civilian side, the key technologies to research are unlocking trading ports (because you need to build them to get more money), and early warning radar so you know when enemy ships are coming. Other than that, there are no key technologies that alter the game. It's not like Civilization where you really feel the pain of falling behind in research.

The AI isn't very bright. It will harass your planets if you put it on ""agressor"" mode, but it's really bad at going in for the kill and actually taking you over. On ""hard"" level, the computer players have massively more ships than you do, but are too stupid to use them effectively.

Thinking it would make a great supplemental tool, I snatched up My Japanese Coach without looking up the reviews in advance.  Trust me when I say this will never happen again.  Going through the first 29 lessons of this learning game, you get a clear picture of what to expect from the remaining 71.

With the help of a kimono-clad virtual host, you learn various Japanese words and phrases through sound, speech and writing while testing your knowledge in a growing number of minigames.  Mastering words in the minigames unlock the next lesson, a real detriment for those with advanced knowledge of the language.  Another problem with MJC is that it starts off teaching random words and doesn't even cover 'kana,' or Japanese characters, and writing them until Lesson 6, as though assuming the player has some grasp of Japanese.  Speaking of writing, a little experimentation confirms that MJC has issues with the stroke order of kana.  And MJC's point system makes it so you can  grind with the minigames and unlock each lesson while you hardly learn anything.  If that's not enough to dissuade you, the main game's so dependent on the romanization of the language that the player becomes dependent on it too.

I can honestly say from personal experience that one can learn more from the most boring, underfunded college language course than from MJC.  Of course, no video game can truly supplement real-world learning.  With a built-in dictionary and phrasebook included in the game, I still recommend it if only to build up your vocabulary.

I will preface this by saying i am the 15th World ranked player on this game and if i played as much as the others i would be top 5. Anyways, I say this because im serious about this game.  And i have tried for months to get someone to answer this. Currently When i play 6vs6 (OTP) the settings/game play seem accurate. Meaning passes are good,shots are remotely accurate, i can get loose pucks. NOW- When i try to play  (versus) 1on1, HUT, or even League play this happens: The passes are missed,the shots are off, i can not get loose pucks as easy. It is like going from playing All-star mode to a rookie mode. And players with WAY LOWER TALENT are able to beat me consistently.  It is like someone has lowered my game sliders in game to give the opponent a better chance.. I have become so frustrated i only play 6on6 which too has its problems with kick outs and every other game somebody won't play position,or wants to fight at each puck drop. I want to enjoy all these modes but i cant. I think the game manufactures have put in place these incremental problems so bad players will be able to stay ""in the game"" when playing a great player.  And it gives them a chance.

The Bad: Level design feels stale towards the end, sporadic level design, exactly the same as the last game

The first game rose to great acclaim due to the excellent classic FPS action, rocking soundtrack, superb weapons, and varied enemy and level design. Battle out of Hell is the expansion that picks off where the last ended. You are ascending out of Hell to stop Alastor who is trying to create a massive army to take over Heaven. While the story doesn't do much but conclude the last game it's pretty bare bones.

The expansion adds 10 new levels and two awesome new weapons. The new weapons are a sniper rifle that shoots spears and the alternate fire is a bunch of bombs that can bounce around. The second weapon is a machine gun with the alt fire of a flamethrower. Both weapons are useful and very fun to use in combination with the already excellent arsenal. The action is exactly the same as the last game just with new enemies and levels. Some levels are really short while some drag one for quite a while so the game feels a bit sporadic and badly paced.

The new levels are awesome such as the Orphanage, Loony Park, and Lab, but after those three the creativity dies down quickly. The Loony Park features a full roller coaster ride while you shoot enemies and the Orphanage is really spooky with creepy kids that you kill. After that the levels just feel like generic hallways with different designs. My least favorite were the Colosseum and Stone Pit. There is one level that is only available on Nightmare difficulty. Other than that the multiplayer adds some new maps, but once again, no one plays online (stick with LAN).

If you really love Painkiller or never picked up the expansion you're missing out on some really great shooting action, but it can wear thin towards the end, especially the story.","Not as imaginative as the original, but worth a buy",1332892800,,,
3.0,True,"05 21, 2008",A14NA0W8ESGDSI,B000QW9D14,T.L.,"One of the first things you'll notice as you begin to play Blue Dragon is that the game's story revolves around a simple good versus evil dichotomy with little variation in character outlook from that. The good characters are sickly good and the evil characters are deviously evil --- there are no characters with real depth. It's for this reason I find it hard to see in any of the characters human characteristics or relate to any of them.

The models as well are childish in nature and make the characters (which the manual states are in their late teens) look like they're all under the age of 10.

The plot from the very beginning is also easy to read and lacks any sort of depth or any form of twist to keep the player engaged. It's like reading a story after reading a summary of the plot --- you just don't find yourself surprised when something happens because you knew it was going to happen. If an RPG doesn't shake your worldview in the slightest I consider it a complete failure.

As for the great mechanics I mentioned in my title --- I found the game design to be wonderful despite it's flaws with an actual story. The usage of the charge bar keeps the user engaged and I found the enemies to level up progressively at a reasonable pace similar to your own growth so it kept things somewhat enjoyable. The idea behind making random encounters random but allowing the user to attack them was also very cool (Secret of Mana style meets Final Fantasy < 12 JRPG battle system sort of thing).

The real problem with the mechanics, however wonderful, is that it's very very very easy to get higher levels simply because the enemies tend to be plentiful but easy to kill in one or two rounds from the start on once you've gained any sort of advantage. Your fighters will have mow down techniques which hit the whole first row for nearly the life of the enemy which could easily allow you to rack up experience points if that was your intention.

Quickly want to mention the shadow system. It allows users to attach a different class to their shadow to gain skills which can be set to other shadow classes they use. To put it simply I level up my black magic class and get the ability to use black magic level 1 spells on my fighter class by assigning it the skill I learned. The classes all have their own stats so it does have variations in terms of attack power in or out of the class but as others have mentioned can also allow you to create 5 distinct clones of each character with little trouble. I didn't, however, and found the system to be fun so it's really whether or not you take advantage of the system which will affect you in that regards. It could have been made better though, I agree, and more class selections would have given a more unique feel to the process as well.

Here is an example of the poor balance in gameplay.

You will see a monk on the map and approach him. He has 24 HP and you kill him pretty easily. You walk a few minutes and encounter another monk. This one is level 11 and has 150 HP and kills you with 2 hits before you can escape (run away from) the encounter.

Electroplankton had a very limited release in the US, but in Europe and Asia, it was shipped out like any other game, and copies are/were plentiful. Those versions are the -exact same- as the US version, but with slightly different packaging. So why bother spending so much money for something you can get cheaper from another country? And no, shipping's never as bad as you expect, especially since DS games are so small.

But the main thing about Electroplankton is that people want to know if it's worth it. I had the game for a few months before selling it. After spending a dozen or so hours with the game, there's no way I would pay even the original MSRP for it. But people seem to get uppity and say that it's not fair to judge this as a game because it's 'art' (an excuse I'm seeing A LOT of lately). Call it art all you want- there isn't much replay value to this game.

Electroplankton has 10 different music modes, though only a few of them are really good. Some make use of voice recordings, some vary in pitch depending on the speed of the lines you draw on the screen, and some are based on time. Some of these modes change a little if you press Select,  placing the Plankton in different patterns or creating entirely different sounds. You can create some truly beautiful pieces using the Plankton, even if you don't know what you're doing or practice much. The game is controlled with the stylus, though I can't help but wonder if it would've benefitted from making use of the buttons and d-pad too.

The big problem with the game is that you can't save your compositions. If you make a really nice track, there's no way to record it on the game. You can plug the DS into your computer with certain cords, but most people won't know that before buying the game. Why isn't there a save feature here? Look at how many DS games push the system like Moon or Final Fantasy IV and have save features. Chances are, you'll be stuck using a digital recorder device or just recording footage with a camera. Also, Electroplankton feels like it's a long demo for a better game coming out because of the lack of features.

Unless you're some kind of die-hard 'art' game fan or just a DS collector, you're not missing much by skipping Electroplankton. The graphics can be pretty at times, but they're nothing fancy, and a lot of the music you can make sounds great, but it's teasing you by not allowing you to save anything.

Now to my points, lets first discuss how funny it is that people claim how ""Scary"" this game is. In honest opinion this game is not as scary as the reviews would have you think. I'd say it's more disturbing than scary and this points to my only true gripe about the game. This ""Disturbing"" effect wares away after awhile, it does and when it does, out goes the ""Horror"" that you are supposed to feel.

Now don't get mad at me Silent Hill Fanboys! I did say the game was fun no matter how you shake it up... and that's the truth. Silent Hill for it's time was a game that stood under the HUGE shadow of Resident Evil. With respects it cast it's own light for it's fans BUT you cannot compare Silent Hill and Resident Evil as the same thing. Neither is really better than the other... it all depends on what you want to get your heart pounding (And NO Silent Hill is not for a more mature level of player Ha Ha both games are on the same level!) so go for the game if you wish to play a classic or looking for a quick thrill.

Now to sum up the ending of my rant/review I'd have to say the reason this game received a 3 is because in truth the sound and graphics are sub-par. The storyline is at best mediocre and it will have you shaking your head in the end (I had to find a website dedicated to explaining the storyline for this game... yeah that bad!). I know I know... it's dated... blah blah blah... but seriously what scared you more? Harry's funny running graphics or the silly looking demon-dogs? As I've said to friends, it's the initial shock of seeing something you had not seen before.

So thats it... I hope you buy this title as it does deserve a play through. However if your looking for a ""Scary"" and or ""Horror"" game I'd suggest you either pick up Silent Hill 2 or Resident Evil 4. They are scary at times and without the hassle of the almost unplayable, ANNOYING and POINTLESS puzzles alocated throughout Silent Hill.

The Diamond/Pearl generation marks the debut of the core Pokemon series on the DS. It isn't as strong a return as I was hoping for.

Let's start with the Pokemon themselves. Each new generation of Pokemon is less and less likable to me. They just seem to have less personality than the original generation. And there are more legendary Pokemon running around than we know what to do with. Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo...who were they, again? The status of being a ""legendary Pokemon"" has lost its lustor. What I'm trying to get at is that Dialga and Pakia, like many others in the new generation, are unlikeable and lifeless, whereas the original legendaries (and the original 150, for that matter) were brimming with character and lovability (yes, even Mewtwo).

The gameplay has mostly been conserved. There aren't really any innovations that really jump out at you. The Pokemon in battles are still represented with sprites and still growl in 8-bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. My problem with the battle sequences is that they seem really slow for some reason, even with text scrolling set on fast and battle scenes set off. It takes forever to execute the attack and show the resulting drain on HP or status effect.

The story is also standard Pokemon fare. I was definitely hoping for something new on this front. Ever since the original Red and Blue, the story has consisted of your character battling through the gyms up to the Elite 4, while taking down an iteration of Team Rocket on the way. A different storyline would, I believe, greatly benefit any Pokemon games to come in the future.

Overall, is is a decent game that simply pales in comparison to the experiences offered by its predecessors. Players new to Pokemon will probably enjoy the game more than people who have been playing Pokemon since the beginning, simply because they will not have the same hollow feeling that those who grew up playing Pokemon will have.

It's more of a side scroller action game rather than an RPG, like the GC version was.  Though the game is good, there were several things that really annoyed me

The bad:
1. It's good to have some dialogue in a good video game, but Super Paper Mario over does it.  You have cut scenes between cut scenes, with a short cut scene in between that.  All the reading got on my nerves and I found myself just laying back hitting the buttons just to get it over with, without reading what was going on.  Especially in world 7.  The end of world 7 was ridiculous.  ""blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"" I'm thinking when are they going to shut up?  I hated world 7.  It was annoying, long, and didn't even fit the natural line of the game.  world 6 is kinda dark and gloomy.  Dark colors, creepy atmosphere and then all of a sudden you're in world 7 with fluffy clouds, cute little angel like things and god awful background music.  World 7 seemed to drag on and on.  I hated it.  When you finally get through this level, after the tormenting long dialogue, you go to the next Chapter, 8.  Which is also dark, gloomy and black.  World 7 just didn't fit the game at all.  World 8 sucks.  Enemies pop out of nowhere, enemies that are difficult to avoid. Cheap shots, etc.

2. GC version, the music was really cool.  Kinda catchy.  Not in this one.  SPM is a bunch of random goofy sounds put together and was rather obnoxious (especially the awful level 7).  Yeah....  didn't like the music. World 2 and 6 weren't bad soundtracks.

3. Endless walking and wandering around.  Before you can proceed to the next Chapter of the game, you have to find what is called a ""Heart Pillar"", which can be confusing.  You find yourself walking around town, the outskirts of town, above the town, under the town and everywhere else, trying to find the stupid pillar.  There are no clues as to where the next heart pillar is, so you find yourself wandering around the town of Flipside without any direction.  And it gets worse in the later chapters of the game, because not only do you have the town of Flipside, but you also have Flopside.  And sections of the game called ""Underwhere"" and ""Overthere"" and it turns into this jumbled confusing MESS because all the names and places are so similar so it's very difficult to find your way around, especially since Flopside is a mirror of Flipside.  So be prepared to waste time just roaming around, flipping into 3D and back, falling over edges and everything else trying to find the next part of the game.

4.  Controls kinda suck.  I'm not saying the controls are BAD, but it has it's flaws.  There seems to be a slight delay from the time you hit the button to the time you jump.  3D mode can be confusing because it's hard to tell exactly where you are.  For instance, if you are trying to hit a block, it's difficult to tell whether you are under the block or not.  If you have to jump over a pit, it's hard to tell where the pit starts and ends so you end up falling down the hole.

5.  It's action.  Not RPG.

6.  Too repetitive.  It would have been nice to be able to travel to different towns, meet different people and do some more interesting side quests.  But you're pretty much stuck in the same area throughout the whole game.  It gets boring after awhile because there's nothing new to see in town.

Aside from all that, the game wasn't terrible.  It had it's good things.  The characters were charming and I found myself laughing at much of some of the dialogue (the dialogue I actually payed attention to.  Very creative.  You have to stop and wonder, ""What were they smoking when they made this game???  This is your brain on drugs.""  I especially enjoyed playing as Bowser.  He was the best character to play, his dialogue was funny and he's just awesome.  The only character that can breathe fire as a method of attack.  Peach can block with her umbrella but it's pretty useless IMO.  There probably could have been more interaction from the pixl fairies.  With the exception of Tippi, the others just seem to just ""hang out"".

If there's one thing I don't like, is a short game.  This one wasn't too terribly short.  I'm on my 4th day playing and have about 20 hours of play time into it, but I haven't finished it yet.  I'm on Chapter 8 so I'm nearing the end.  The game would be longer if you buy the treasure maps, find the treasures and do the quests for some extra treasure, but the treasures just aren't worth it.  A card, mushroom, eh.  Nothing important. But it's a little something extra if you really want to waste your time with it.

The clerk at the counter briskly warned me 'you will be disappointed',the guy seemed like a game snob so I paid no attention.

SO IS IT WORTH BUYING?
Yes and no...I'll clarify. I did notice the cinematic voice overs had a slight delay but I didn't care that's not what you buy a game for but yes the originals didn't suffer this issue. The fog in your roaming environment isn't quite as thick as the original versions but it's still effective and lends atmosphere to the game. These things I can overlook in a $29.99 game bundled with two Silent Hill games that are out-of-print...my problem was Silent Hill 2. There will be off and on times in SH2 where I'll try to attack an enemy and the glitch kicks in-you can't move,attack,pause the game, or even exit out to quit the game to restart. Completely functionless. Basically you stand there like an idiot while a monster tears you to shreds. The second bug I've encountered a few times only is running-making a long sprint down a hall occasionally I've seen the character stop, more like a glitch/stutter effect. To conclude it's nice to come back and play the earlier Silent Hill games so I can't say the collection is entirely a waste of money. But when overall controller function issues kick in?yeah that's a problem there's no excuse for. It's a shame too because I've got my heart set on Konami releasing a bundled version of all of out-of-print SH games and I was hoping this would keep me satisfied for a while...just not like this for future reference.

Resolution & FPS=1080p@60p
In my honest opinion on the graphics comparing devil may cry 4 these graphics for a ps4 aren't all that. It says 1080p but looks more like a 720p which not bad but was hoping for better.

Language=Japanese
Even though it's from Japan doesn't take much effort to learn what is what because something's are in English so that helps too. Very easy to understand the music as it it's also in English for most part

Music=Repetitive in a battle.
The music is for most in English but it loops over and over in a battle until you end that area then the next area has different music. The music is great for combat much better than dmc4.

Camera Angling=Able to live with
In the option menu you have the option to change the camer distance from near so you see more of you or far so you seem more around you. You also have lock on button to help direct you.

Blood & Gore=Beautiful
You get 3 colors of blood and maybe more later on. You have starting option colors White,Red, or Black. I like the red but black has a great taste because demons or zombies should have black blood because their evil lol. The Gore is great you can cut limbs off or cut them in half.

Weapons=Okay
So far I've come across a sword,chainsaw,fist,boomerang,2hand sword. Probably gonna have more later on though. You also can upgrade them and buy more.

For Starters
R3+L3=Demon mode
Press X+Square after getting hit to recover that lost
Special power press Circle + Triangle
The dpad pressing right or left selects your spells/powers
The dpad up and down is to select other characters.
The L2 tapping it changes your weapons.
Holding Touchpad down calls out other characters in party.
The R2 is to run really fast and or dodge.
The touchpad is used in this so make sure when you see a blue arrow in a battle take down you swip the touchpad not the dpad or the analog. Like me lol..

Players=1 offline no online.

Worth buying?
Yes but don't suspect it to be crazy amazing even if it is a ps4 game at 60fps lol it's a great game for devil may cry or just hack and slash players.

What has this game done right?
  Awesome graphics, huge variety of weapons, and intense battles.  I am not a big graphics nut, as long as the game can create an environment that draws the player in it is a success in my opinion on the graphics front.  Speaking of atmosphere, the variety of weapons are amazing.  I am a former Army infantryman which has given me a healthy interest in guns and as such I enjoy the detail of the weapons.  I have shot many weapons similar to the ones in this game and I can say that they feel right, except for one thing...
What has this game done wrong?
  The gun sounds are absolutely horrible, the AI sucks, and (my copy at least) has many glitches.  The sounds are the worst I have ever heard in a WWII game, which should not be an issue at this stage in videogame technology.  The BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) sounds like someone beating on a plastic trash can turned upside down.  Not all the rifles are that terrible but the sound of that gun in real life is actually quite terrifying (and deafening) being that it shoots a deer-hunting bullet, and it's an automatic.  As for the AI, I frequently found the enemy troops just walking around in the middle of me and my fellow Marines.  If it were't for the vast number of enemy swarming our positions, the enemy would not have stood a chance.  They are just idiots.  Worst of all, my system is constantly crashing after playing for about 30 minutes (I own an old school 60GB).  The system won't work at all even after I reset it.  The screen gets all pixelated and is unresponsive to any button I press except the power button.  I have to unplug the system completely and let it sit for awhile which seems to work for now.  Other games work fine, though it could also be the new update (v1.04).  My buddy's system seems to work fine though, I don't know how widspread this issue is.

Sony must have found a lot of positive feedback about the arena battles from previous games in the series, because as others say, Deadlocked is mostly that.

There are two major areas to go - one is a shuttle to the arena, two is a shuttle to whichever planetary quest you're currently on.  Two is still very much dodge and shoot, not as inventive and expansive as the earlier games, and you get the feeling that Deadlocked is rushing you.  You're humming along and suddenly it's the last challenge and you're left wondering where all the game went.  ""Get moving and finish already!"" you can almost hear it scream.  Maybe it's a subleminal audio track.

Although the non-arena quests do offer some of what the former games had, they simply don't compare with their scope.

It is still great fun, though.  I like the new weapons system and the fact that you can earn bolts quickly enough to get some serious firepower, unlike the earlier games where it took forever to buy and upgrade your hardware.  At first I was annoyed that they had changed some of the controls (the first 3 worked essentially the same), but quickly got used to it.  Also, I used the target-lock view instead of normal 3rd-person view for the first time and found myself preferring it (at least for Deadlocked).

So, should you buy? I suggest 'absolutely yes.'  The humor is still there (although the announcer's comments can get repetive after you've played it through once), with one or two genuine laugh-out-loud moments, the weapons are great, the graphics are excellent, and the quests have some replay value.  There are a few much more tolerable ""race"" type challenges, a hoverbike, a hovership and a dunebuggy, which is a good thing.  I hate, hate, hate the races from previous games.

3.0,True,"10 22, 2010",A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B001CMIUYS,DA,"When I first played FF7, I fell in love with it and the RPG genre in general. Throughout the years, I come to expect that each version of FF will offer both an awesome cinematic experience, and intriguing game mechanics. FF13 offers the awesome cinematic experience, but the game mechanics seem to be out of date.

When FF12 came out, I felt it was an interesting approach: it offered the same cinematic experience, but at the same time it attempts to keep an open world going and a sense of modern-ness.

With FF13, it's a bit of a step back from everything. The familiar ATB system has returned (though a form of it was used in FF12), the familiar touch-the-enemy-to-battle is back, the linear gameplay straight-shot-A-to-B is back, and the game is severely simplified to the point of near mindless repetition. Comparing to FF12 it seems the series has taken a major turn for the worst. Not saying that FF12 is the best, but I am saying that with FF12 at least they were attempting to recognize innovation with modern times.

When I think of an RPG, I think of one thing: control. Controlling how my characters develop, controlling where to go, what sort of equipment I need, how I should fight an enemy, etc. While most RPGs base off these ideas, FF13 has severely hindered user control and instead replaced it with automation. Nearly everything is automated:

1) You can't control other characters. You can select what character to be your ""main"" at any point, but once it's battle time, you can only control your main, but you cannot switch to other members mid battle. You MUST allow the AI to control it and it normally does a good job. Also if your main dies, the game is over. You cannot revive your main character, but you can revive the other two. This was one of the worst feature I have ever seen in a game and felt like I was playing Persona 3 or something.
2) You can only have weapons and accessories. That's right, that's all you get! By the end of the game, you'll probably have 3 slots open for accessories, but even then it really doesn't matter as you can defeat the game without it. But it offers no variety to game play set up.
3) You have defined roles and they're unlocked at various points in the game. Basically the game breaks down into a job-class system. You got your attacker, magic user, healer, buffer, debuffer, and tank. The problem is each character's jobs are given to you at some point in the game. Like at the start, each character has 3 jobs, and as the game progresses, you're able to make them stronger by investing points into each of the jobs. After each battle you get certain points that you can use to invest into each job class. The problem is the game is broken up in chapters and on each chapter you can only have a certain number of points invested into your jobs before it's maxed out - and it's easy to max out. So basically if you max out a role at some chapter in the game, you just have to wait until later to unlock further into the class. In other words, the game controls when and how you can develop your characters. Until the end of chapter 9, you basically have very little control even for your jobs, and even then at the end of the game you won't be able to unlock the final stages of your job until you load the clear file. So in other words, you have to beat the game once just to unlock an entire job.
4) The battle is OVER simplified. Basically you can either input controls automatically or you can allow ""auto-battle"" which will either attempt to find the best attacks against the enemy, or attempt to figure out what the best attacks are (depending on if you did a scan of the enemy). So this basically means you can Auto-Battle your way through, and even if you manually enter your attacks, you'll find it very repetitive. So every battle, you're doing the same exact ""Auto-Battle."" You could Auto Battle your entire game and not worry ever about wasting time. The main strategy in battle is to make sure your characters are in the right roles. Like for example, my main battle party is Lightning, Hope and Fang. I usually have Lightning and Hope as magic users and Fang as a warrior. This combination works well 99% of the time.
6) No leveling! Besides the role leveling, you don't earn experience and level at all. You can only go off your stats. Interestingly if you unlock a stat in one class, it's applied to your character. So this means if you have health increase to your magic class, it's applied if you choose a warrior class. Only specific abilities is tied to a class.
7) You don't earn money in battle. That's right, there isn't any form of currency after battle. Of course, this presents a problem for casual people, but for those who seriously need money for upgrading or whatnot, can get money from items. For example, some monsters drop an item that by itself is worth nothing, but when you go to a store, you can sell it for large amount of money.
8) No interactions! FF13 is set in this huge world. You're an outcast though, so it makes a little sense, but overall, you have very little interaction with the inhabitants of FF13 if at all. I don't think there is any way to initiate a conversation and throughout the entire game you rarely speak with others, even your own team. They may make comments about the environment from time to time, but other than that, they do little to no talking.

Overall the game is simplified too much for me. At first, I felt like giving it up, but I kept playing. Overtime it sort of grew on me. While the game is over-simplified, I sort of grew attached to it. The story itself is rather generic, but I sort of fell in love with the main character: Lightning (the woman on the front cover). She seems tough and neat at the same time. Quite possibly the only interesting character. I have my xbox with the Lightning wallpaper and if you 5 star the last boss, you get to unlock her picture as your profile picture. I felt this was cool and I managed to unlock it and now my theme is complete! As far as other characters, they're rather annoying. If I had to line up the degree of annoying, I'd go with: Vanille as the top annoying character due to her voice and her ""happy"" theme but at the same time just annoying, Sazh since he's such a cry baby, Snow as this guy makes little to no sense at all, and then last is Hope as he's just going around trying to act tough but at the same time, I'd just like to put him and Vanille in a box and drop it off. Fang is pretty cool character, but she looks like an oily surfer/beach goer of some sort. It's almost like if you stood next to her and breathe in you'd jerk in reaction to the salt contents. Then again, the only thing kept me going was the Lightning character as she's the most interesting. Plus she got her sister, Serah, who she's trying to protect which makes her pretty cool in my book.

So overall the game is overly simplified. Great cinematic, one cool character Lightning, and that's just about it. I rank that it's fun to play Lightning even though it's too simplified, but it's still wonderful experience for anyone playing. I played for about 70 hours myself and had a great time. However, others can complete the game in about 30-40 hours if even that.",Fairly good throughout but not keeping up with modern designs,1287705600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's like a car game where you can crash it into other cars or walls or objects as much as you want but all you'll do is bounce off of it and not have a single dent or scratch on your car because they wanted to focus on the ""aspect of the cars themselves and the feeling of driving it"".

K, maybe some people like simulator games but, I for one, do not. I wish people would realize we play games to do things we couldn't do in real life. Like launching yourself off the biggest ramp going full speed and do 27 seconds worth of tricks in the air. Not driving around on a track that sets you back on the track if a single millimeter of your tire goes out of bounds.

This just wasn't what I was expecting / what I personally was wanting but it's still a decent game for some. I'll give it 3 stars for it being a game I'll play one race on and then never touch again.",-99/1 Billion,1461628800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"01 4, 2009",ASPJAVXNRF1EU,B000WQWQ36,Alain Gomez,"I am an avid Sims player and have been so since the first Sims.  When talking to friends about the game, I have frequently mentioned how cool it would be to have a Sims game that takes you away from the standard ""doll house"" suburbia scenario.  I mean, how hard would it be to make a medieval Sims, you know?

So enter Castaway Stories.  The concept has so much potential.  No longer does your sim just exist in a house and have a job.  Now he/she must survive.  From climbing up banana trees to spear fishing to having a pet monkey, Castaway seemingly starts out as that breath of fresh air so desperately needed in the series.  This game is completely unique from all the other expansions AND ""stories.""  New interactions, new goals, new game focus.

This was my initial impression as I played through the preset Castaway ""story.""  And I have to admit, it sucked me in.  Then I completed the story thinking ""at last, now I can really have some fun in this new environment.""  Sadly, this was not to be the case.  This game is riddled with bugs.  It's like the developers never envisioned the players using the free play option.  As soon as I started to do normal interactions like hiring a maid or having children, the game became glitchy and sluggish.  My guess is that the game engine was not designed to handle more than the preset number of sims.

This guess was further supported by evidence when I went into full neighborhood view.  For both the free play and story neighborhoods, you cannot add lots.  As in, you can't put down extra houses, you can't put down any empty lots, you can't add extra commercial lots and you can't edit the currently existing commercial lots.  Ummm... what? I could sort of understand the no editing commercial lots (it would interfere with the story), but no extra houses?!?  Needless to say, this led to a very frustrating, limiting, and shallow game play.  Add to it the ever increasing amount of bugs that continued to pop up as I tried to expand and build.

So... yes.  That's pretty much the sad and depressing tale of Castaway Stories.  I should note that my experiences were based on laptop play.  I have not yet tried to install the game and play it on my desktop.  My laptop had far more than the minimum specs for the game and still these issues cropped up.

For those of you who don't know, Red Dead Revolver is Rockstar's first attempt at a western-themed game. The game has a great presentation, terrific sound, and amazing gameplay. However, in many cases, its flaws outweigh its good spots.
Of course, you can't notice it at first, but this game is brutally short. If you are familiar with this genre, you can breeze through it in about 5 or 6 hours. And I thought Max Payne 2 was short!

You will run across ghost towns, menacing cowboys, and colorful environments.
There is no shortage of weapons in the game, and every weapon feels authentic. Also, the gameplay is great, with smooth controls and good AI.
Basically, if you have any interest in the west, this is a good investment for a game. It just may not be interesting to some people, and you may even just want a rental.

The format of the game is suitable for the DS because it is broken up into chapters lasting around 1/2 an hour each.  In between chapters, you have the chance to scout out the next map, and micro-manage the inventory of your characters.  It is still satisfying to watch your characters level up, and to work your way through maps.  Also, the save points in the map make the game much easier, and will save you hours of frustration.

Unfortunately, since the game is a remake of the first Fire Emblem, it lacks many of the features that differentiate the Fire Emblem series from other turn based strategy games.  The biggest omission is the lack of support conversations.  In other Fire Emblem games, your units have entertaining banter during the missions that gave them personality.  Depending on which conversations you have, you could influence the ending for each unit.  These simple text conversations made you care about your characters and gave you incentive to keep them all alive.  In this game, the characters are introduced in bunches, and never say anything.  I was slightly disappointed when one of them died, but I didn't have that burning desire to restart the mission over again.  The other omission was the inability to rescue other units.  In later Fire Emblem games, you could have stronger units 'carry' the weaker, hurt units, so they wouldn't die.  That gave you a safety net if you accidentally stuck your fragile unit too far on the front line.  The extra save points make rescuing units less crucial, but then the game becomes more trial and error with resetting to the last save state, rather than one continuous battle.

For gamers who've played other Fire Emblem games, I still recommend it. It is a solid game overall, but a step backwards from previous FE entries.
For anyone else who is undecided, I recommend Fire Emblem, and Fire Emblem Sacred Stones which are both for the GBA.","Stellar gameplay, but lacking Fire Emblem charm",1241654400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The enemies aren't too hard and the level design itself is the real challenge.  The problem is that some of the swings have to be perfectly times, and the levels are full of 'hot zones' that are radiated.  If you miss a jump and land in the water, or if you swing yourself deep into a radiated zone, you'll find yourself starting back at the last checkpoint.  This can be extremely tedious at times which is why I can only play this game a few checkpoints at a time.  It's hard to get into a rhythm because after successfully manipulating some hard core jumps, you wind up deep in a radiated zone.  Oh no!  So you leap from the top of the building and as you fall, you didn't fall fast enough so you remained in the zone too long.  You're dead.  Start back and the beginning.  It wouldn't be such a big deal, but there's no telling where you'll stumble into these hot zones.  A good swing can launch your character 100 ft. through the air and you'll never know if you'll land in a safe area.

Tilley Jr.,"Being a big UFC fan, and having dabbled with martial arts and ground-fighting in the past, I was looking forward to this Xbox title above all others.  The screeenshots looked great, and the official web page sent me into a frenzy.  I never owned a Dreamcast, but I have friends who loved that version, and others that loathed the Playstation edition.  I was hoping that the designers had ironed out any bugs from those installments and the Xbox would provide a better system to present the complexities of true NHB, mixed martial arts fighting.
Unfortunately, after the long wait, it could not live up to my high expectations.  While the designers have done a great job making the fighters look like their real-world counterparts, they could have done a better job on the shading  and textures.  All the graphics look a little unfinished to me, and when the action gets fast, they can get really glitchy.  I've noticed that when throwing punches and kicks, the fighters tend to flicker or blink.  Once you notice it, it becomes hard to ignore and very irritating.
The gameplay is a little lopsided as well and it's far more strike-oriented than I'd like.  In the arcade mode the first night I owned the game, I got 47 victories in a row using Tito Ortis and all I had to do was punch, punch, punch.  I liked the ground-fighting a lot more (which isn't surprising for those who know me) but victory seems to have a lot more to do with chance than skill.  While I really liked the realistic submissions and takedowns, most of the grappling is clunky and not very fluid at all. It seems that they have a ways to go before they can really simulate the feel and flow of this type of fighting.
It's not all bad though.  I really liked the create your own fighter feature.  I was disappointed that Royce Gracie wasn't in the game, so I made my own version of him.  There are lots of different advantages you can use to specialize your fighter, and several different fighting styles.  On the down side, I wanted to create Tank Abbot, but the game doesn't seem to offer a model for the less ""defined"" body types.  Seems sort of unfair.  I was hoping the unlocked characters would be actual fighters, but most of them turned out to be fictional characters more at home in a ""Street Fighter"" game than the UFC.  The two exceptions are referee John McCarthy and, my personal favorite Ice T.  Yes, that Ice T.  I got a good chuckle out of that one.
So far the big saving grace of the game is playing with a friend.  I played it for a couple of days alone and was very disappointed.  When a buddy came over and we started playing it, I warmed up to the game considerably.  The AI is nothing compared to a real person, which is true of most games. This game is a great distration and the quickness of the matches is nice when you don't have time to get into something long-term like NFL fever or Halo. It's a pleasant distraction.

3.0,True,"06 22, 2011",A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ,B003O6G1L4,Jason,"Dungeon Siege 3 has been much awaited as it brings the Dungeon Siege element to the Consoles.  While the game has under gone a drastic amount of changes is it enough for this game to stand on, or have the changes made done nothing but sink the ship?  In short a bit of both!  Dungeon Siege 3 simplifies the experience and gears the entire game for console users essentially putting the PC experience on the back burner.  In doing so gone are the micro managing of your comrades, a basic inventory system with a very basic leveling system that does little to promote individual variety(you eventually unlock everything).

Still what we have here is a solid game that will not be a disappointment to the Hack & Slash RPG fans of ye olde day such as Diablo, Titan Quest, etc.

GAMEPLAY
What can I say.. it is a hack n' slash RPG.  Be prepared to go through dungeons grinding away on mobs and collecting loot!  Dungeon Siege 3 does not disappoint in this category. It brings lots of gameplay something crucial to any video game; especially a hack and slash type.  You have a choice of 4 pre-made characters which of course breaks down into typical Warrior, Caster, Rogue etc. When not in dungeons you will be visiting towns to buy and sell goods, pick up some simple quests that are not to bad to complete, and of course continue the storyline.  It is fairly simple but gets the job done.  Dungeons are varied as are the types of mobs you encounter so things get changed up enough to not get boring.  Throw in a variety of difficulty levels and drop-in/out co-op and you have a pretty solid gameplay experience.

Combat is handled exceptionally well I feel for a hack & slash on a console.  Your main attack and 3 skills are bound to your attack buttons while blocking and your stances are controlled via the shoulder/trigger buttons.  During mid-combat with the warrior-type lets say, a bunch of trash rushes you just switch to a 2-handed stance and hack away.  By doing this you open up your 2 Handed skills. Middle of the fight a boss mob comes in you can just switch, on the fly, back to a sword/shield stance and of course unlock 1 handed skills.  You can map 3 skills per stance which makes you have to choice between the available skills per stance.  Toss in Proficiencies, which add some customization to the skills by allowing you to pick a perk for that skill, and you have a simple yet somewhat diverse set of skills.  While it is no Diablo or Titan Quest in skill variety and customization it keeps it very simple.

GRAPHICS
The game looks pretty good on the console.  I have not checked it out on the PC but it is a very pretty game.  The fire effects aren't bad and the variety of colors and effects for your skills are awesome.  By no means is this a perfect engine here but it has graphical appeal and does help to make the world a bit more recognizable.  I did notice some slow down on the PS3 version when I was looking awkwardly at fire with the camera, but I tend to try and kill the frame-rates on purpose at times.  Combat however was very smooth and I noticed no difference between the PS3 or 360 versions when it came to the FPS during combat or cut-scenes.

SOUND/STORY
The effects and sound track here aren't bad.  I would say average.  Nothing special to talk about but the voice acting I would say is sub-par.  Many times it seemed as is the actors/actresses really did not care much about their lines.  This puts a damper on the already boring storyline.  Yes there is a storyline here for a Hack & Slash!  A detailed storyline to boot!  Problem is I found the storyline incredibly boring and uninteresting.  A lot of it had to do with the dialogue as it really didn't sell you on the story.  Still there is some meat here to give purpose to your adventure.

REPLAY/LENGTH
What good is a hack & slash without replay!?  Well this game boasts some solid replay value if you are up for it.  Where as past Hack and Slash games I have played allow you to continue on harder difficulties with your existing loot... not the case here. There is no Game+ feature here. Instead you just start a new difficulty from square one again.  Replay value will come down to simple trophy/achievement collecting, simple enjoyment of the game and of course Co-Op.  The game itself took me around 13-15 hours to complete on my play-through; and I have yet to replay it on another difficulty since nothing carries over.

*** CO-OP FEATURES *** ( 4 player ONLINE support, no LAN support, 2 player LOCAL co-op )
A crucial part of this game that people have been getting confused about.  Co-Op works very strange in this game and while it does work.. it doesn't at the same time.  Much like how the game really simplified the elements almost to a fault, the Co-Op was simplified far past a fault.  Not only is there a lack of Game+ here, but Co-Op works fairly backwards for a game of this type.  If you hop into a game online or with your friend only, your SP character WILL NOT be used.  No progress you make with your friend/PUG will carry to your account.  You are simply there for moral support you could say.  To make things worse, even if you are doing Co-Op on different accounts (like a 4 player PUG group) the host is who the camera centers on.  Meaning you are locked into the hosts camera frame.  While this just takes time to get used to, it seems like a colossal step backwards compared to previous hack&slash titles.  The overall Co-Op experience can be a lot of fun if you put aside gear, level and just work as a team to have some fun.

OVERALL 73% (7.3) .. C
Dungeon Siege 3 is not a bad game by any means.  It simplified the Hack & Slash elements to suit the console but in doing so it over-simplified the elements down to a no-brainer.  While perhaps a disappointment at first glance Dungeon Siege 3 still brings gameplay to the table and lots of it.  There is plenty to do here, and despite a slightly simplified dungeon design you still have tons of baddies to plow through and loads of loot to gather.

A weak inventory system holds it back as does the Co-Op method used by the game but still... this is the kind of game Hack and Slash fans have been craving for a long time.  It is a fresh change of pace for the genre despite being simplified.  While not a full-price for some, it is a game worth picking up if you are a fan of the genre.  The flaws in DS3's armor are not bad enough to ruin the game but it might leave a sour taste if you set expectations to high.

My first Guitar Hero guitar was the X-Plorer controller and it was and is a great guitar to use with the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, but unfortunately it's not wireless. I got Guitar Hero III with the Les Paul on launch day and it worked perfectly. The strum bar was more quiet than the X-Plorer's, the buttons were easier on the fingers, the conveniences of customizable faceplates and a detachable neck for storage blew my mind, and most importantly, it was a wireless guitar! Fast forward almost three years later and it's not the same sugar coated story. I still enjoy the strum bar and fret button designs, but the neck is the flaw that killed it for me. Since it's designed to come off, the neck has connectors that let the guitar work when the neck is attached to the body of the controller. Over time, this connection gets weaker and eventually makes the controller useless. No matter what I try, the guitar refuses to recognize when I push the green or orange buttons.

This game could've easily been one of the greatest JRPG's of all time, but it decided to have an obnoxiously clean outlook. Here's my list of flaws with this game that just... Drag it down: (No Spoilers, Don't Worry)

-When a character dies(yes, many do) they vanish, no death scenes given, no showing the body for emotional effect. This includes enemies and bosses, even the Final Boss!!! Only one character in the game has a death scene, and it's prolonged to the point of it being annoying. No blood is shown as well, so the scene is just completely worthless.

-There is a distinct lack of romantic involvement between some of the characters who, in the end, somehow have deep affection for one another. But where was this during the game?! There were 0 signs leading up to it!

-The final twist at the end is quite lame, and just leaves the fate of the world ambiguous. The ending is surprisingly not uplifting for a game that has constantly been bringing my spirits up!

To avoid being a debbie-downer, I'll put the positives of the game below:

+Great characters, great development for said characters

+Battle system is very unique that becomes increasingly harder but more efficient as you level.

+Artwork is fantastic.

+Voice work for both Japanese and English are great.

All in all, if you don't mind big flaws in the story and writing, this game is quite amazing, and I would definitely recommend.",An amazing game that suffers from being 'too clean'.,1409270400,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

3.0,False,"03 5, 2015",AHIULA7DZ2AP1,B00KY1HZ62,Erokengo,"I'll go into this review admitting that I'm punishing this game somewhat for not being Raging Blast 2.  It IS a vast improvement over Ultimate Tenkaichi and Battle of Z.  And I mean vast.  First and most glaring plus is the fresh take on the story.  DBZ games have caught a lot of flak over the years for rehashing the same story over and over again (though considering the manga has been done for over a decade there's only so much ye can do).  In this one ye get to create a custom character in an interesting way and plug them with supers and ultimates, change wardrobe, etc etc. The interface is actually kind of fun once ye get the hang of it (I still have a bad habit of constantly going the opposite direction of what I want within Toki Toki City and have to basically run through the whole thing.  In all the game seems to be a condensed console version of the Dragon Ball Online game that came out in Asia, which I consider to be a good thing since that seemed interesting.
For the bad, The graphics are good but a bit overdone for my tastes.  The power curve of the AI is frustratingly inconsistent.  Level grinding can be maddeningly tedious.  The play controls are manageable but not what I would call good.  Of course, here is where I MAY be guilty of needlessly punishing it for not being RB2 since that game had, in my opinion, the best fighting system.  Parts of the combat in this game seem to be like ""well we can't just borrow the play controls for that other game, we have to be different for the sake of being different!""  It turns out to be a rather big deal because this game REALLY suffers for it.  There is no reliable homing dash so ye run into this problem of either plodding slowly up to yer opponent or trying to use the dash function and blowing past them.  Ki Charging is a special technique itself rather than just being a separate function.  Super Saiyan transformations only last as long as ye have energy to fuel it and ye drop out of it when ye get to 0.  I mean honestly if Dimps had just used the fighting system from their own Budokai games while just making it an over the shoulder fighter it would have been MUCH better.  I flat out don't understand alot of the decisions made with the play controls in this game.  Also alot of the function of the game seems dependent on connecting to the Xenoverse server, which at this point in time is kinda a crap shoot as to whether it's working or not.  Since I rarely use the online functions in games I'm not counting this against it, and it'll probably get better later on, but for others this might be a problem.
In conclusion, I gave this game 3 stars because unlike the previous two offings it's not an unplayable mess.  I found the new story functions to be interesting and the character creator to be a fun aspect.  However, it loses points because the combat itself is clumsy.","Not Perfect, But A Step In The Right Direction",1425513600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"01 1, 2007",A17KMHCEI7AI56,B000F5IH2I,L. J. L.,"Anyone who followed news of Final Fantasy XII, the final installment of the legendary RPG series on the Playstation 2, should know what a troubled history it had. Several years of delays and several key members of the development team leaving before the project's completion definitely shows on the final product. With its balance issues and muddled, poorly done storyline, I can't help but feel that Square-Enix, sensing the final days of the Playstation 2 approaching, just shoved this one out the door and hoped for the best.

A departure for the series, Final Fantasy XII uses a quasi-real time battle system similar to what you'd find in an online RPG. Character AIs are controlled by the gambit system, battle routines that you program for each character before hitting the field. Of course, you can still input commands manually, but the gambit system really does make things flow more seemlessly. While the semi-real time combat does speed things up quite a bit by eliminating random battles, it sacrafices most controll and strategy usually required to play these types of games. The gambit system works a little too well, as all you really need is a few properly enabled healing and attack commands enabled and all the game requires of you is to steer the characters around the map. In fact I always turned the AI script off for my party leader just so I could press a button every once in a while. Even boss battles don't require much more strategy than melee attacking and healing every once in a while.

The game goes even further in destroying the need for strategy by introducing quickenings. These are super powerful, magic draining attacks that you can chain together for massive damage in you have quick enough fingers. Just wear a boss down to half of its life bar and unleash one of these babies to finish him off. If that doesn't work, switch in your reserve fighters to finish him off.

The game has also done away with automatically earning money for every enemy defeated. Instead you have to rely on loot, the items monsters drop at random. You must buy everything from armaments to magic to new gambits and its all very expensive. Imagine how hard it would be too buy that several thousand coin spear if only every fourth monster gave you something to pawn off. Compound that with even late in the game, about 3/4th of the loot dropped pays only a pittance when you sell it. I never had to intentionally build my levels because I was always severely overly powerful from just earning money to buy equipment.

Then there is the utterly frustrating treasure system. In Final Fantasy XII there is no set treasure item in each box. The strategy guide tells me that there is a box that might contain a super duper weapon. Unfortunately, you only have a one in three chance of getting that. You have a better chance of ending up with a potion or 13 coins. And that is if the chest even appears at all, because as I trekked through the fields, I found that more often the not the chests containing the better items were suspiciously absent.

Character skills are assigned through the licensing board. Not only must you purchase every piece of gear, magic spell, and fighting technique, but you must also buy a license to equip/use it with points earned from fighting monsters. You'd think this would lead to very open ended skill development, but it doesn't.  Like the weapons, certain magic and techniques are only available after certain points in the game and there is nothing more frustrating than purchasing a license for a nifty looking ability and finding out you won't have access to it unless you go an insane sidequest to defeat some giant rock turtle with two million life points. As for the weapons section of the board, it can be ridiculously unorganized. Some weapons like bows, swords, and spears are neatly grouped together, but others like guns, and ninja swords seem to have been placed all around the board at random.

I'm sorry but it seems for just about every step forward they took, they took three leaps back.

Let's talk about the story, what really makes this a turkey. I'm not going to talk about anything specific after the first five or so hours. After the intense and well-directed opening cinematic, I thought this really would be the masterpiece the hype machine promised it would be. It had everything you'd think an epic should have: large scale battles, death, war, betrayal. The Kingdom of Dalamsca was soundly thrashed in a war against the Archadian Empire. The king surrenders to avoid total annexation by the Empire, but before he can sign the treaty, he is assassinated by Basch, his loyal knight. Several years later, Princess Ashe teams up with a ragtag band of rebels to win the kingdom's freedom back. No one in their right mind should call this well written when one of its few major plot twists is that the assassin was really, that most ridiculous of soap opera clich&eacute;s, Basch's evil twin brother! That is when the story falls down and only struggles back to its feet after another twenty hours. And I absolutely dare anyone to tell me that the first third of this was not totally patterned after the first two Stars Wars movies, the ones from the good trilogy. At about the start of the last 1/3rd it falls down again and never gets back up, as all the carefully drawn political maneuverings are thrown out the window for an increasingly ridiculous and more stereotypical quest for magic rocks. The characters are almost 100% static and I don't think the developers ever really had a clear picture of who they were as, especially towards the end of the game, their personalities seem to change inexplicably from one scene to the next.

In the end, Final Fantasy XII didn't demand much out of me and I didn't give much effort in return. I just sort of sleepwalked through it. It was far from addictive, and I, who usually want to complete every sidequest, ended up only doing the bare minimum. When it was over, I was just left feeling cold. I've played worse games, but this is the worst entry into the series in a long, long time.",Playing on Auto-Pilot,1167609600,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"11 18, 2009",A14FMV461J2V1M,B00269DXCK,Magic Pink,"Just so you know, I really liked Assassin's Creed. The first game was a joy just to run around in; especially exploring the various cities and countryside. That's why this game was such a dissappointment; exploration is a tedious, frustrating experience and, because of the new monetary system, MANDATORY.

Firstly, story. I don't know what game the other review sites are playing, but it's not the one I'm playing. This story is a ridiculous stereotype of bad buddy cop and action movies with a healthy dollop of tired conspiracy thriller; EVERYONE is betraying everyone else; there, I just spoiled it for you. The characters are just as stereotypical: Ezio is basically a drunken, whoring moron who is too stupid to understand anything beyond drinking and violence but we're supposed to excuse that because he's handsome and physically able; the writing is just full of terrible garbage in a similar vein. All villains are either fat or old. Everything is a just a huge neon sign blaring WE CAN'T WRITE. I just cannot get across how really, really poor the whole thing is.

The health system has been re-worked so, rather then just regenerating health if you find a quiet spot, you actually have to break off from the mission you're currently on and seek out street doctors to heal you. This would be fine if it wasn't for the horribly oversensitive, paranoid guards in the game which pretty much attack you on sight now. Instead, it just ends up being a immersion breaking task similar to an annoying fetch quest. Happily you can buy some medicine vials to use on the fly though which aleviates the annoyance; of course, you still need to hunt up money to buy them.

The guards bring up my other big problem; I can't explore anymore. They're so senstive that even running by them will trigger a huge chase and they're so numerous that you can't get anywhere without having to deal with them. They make the whole game seem terribly claustrophobic and not free roaming and non-linear at all. The messy combat system is back simply with additional options making it even messier; lacking even a basic tutorial unmtil well into the game (other then control pop-ups hints which, if you stop to read, you'll end up dead because they don't appear until you're IN a fight) fights end up being sloppy, button mashing dissappointments. Even with all the bizzare, rock-paper-scissor weapon match ups they've added, the only effective way to kill EVERYONE is still simply the same move as the first game; Counter Kill with Hidden Blades, which makes all the weapon buying in the game nothing more then decorations for your villa.

The free running system in this version is touted as improved; in reality it's totally broken. You'll find Ezio constantly veering over 45 degrees off your course to make jumps he doesn't even need to do; he overcompensates ridiculously when jumping so you'll repeatedly find yourself plummeting to the streets below, usually triggering yet another guard chase or need to find ANOTHER doctor, and Ezio's feet are apparently magentically attracted to posts, probably so he can do that lame ""crouch on a high place"" pose as often as possible. I actually had Ezio TURN COMPLETELY AROUND at one point to hop onto a pole he had just passed rather then simply leap across a small alley to the platform on the other side. He'll also frequently get hung up on regular six inch steps; the whole character will freeze and refuse to move at all as if he was on the edge of a steep precipice.

That's not to say the game is devoid of improvements; the new Blending system is neat (and necessary since the guards are complete turds), buying new dyes, armour and weapons is fun and the graphics are as good as they were in the previous game; albeit very similar. There's really no telling you're in different cities then any from the first games at most points; Venis is beautiful tho.

When you do manage to explore, the game is as fun as the first with TONS of things to find but they're hard as anything to find; most are sourrounded with a white glow that almost perfectly matches the sky and roof shingles; if what you're looking for is on the roofs, either wait until night or you'll only find it if you trip over it.

So, if you liked Assassin's Creed for the exploring, this game pretty much kills it and the story is reason alone to never even look at the game case on the shelf. Yes, there's lots of new things added to the game but it's like a spaghetti sauce that started out good but then had way too many ingrediants dumped into it to try to make it better.","Good try, but sloppy",1258502400,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

If you're an adult who likes the story-line, strategy and game play of single player games; if you love the addiction of totally immersing yourself in the world of GTA for weeks or months at a time... well sadly -- those days are over for GTA. For the tweens who's attention span is too short to focus on playing an actual video game -- they'll definitely get bored showing off their cars to their friends after about 10 minutes. Since this game is already over 2 years old, there probably isn't really much online gameplay left in it anyway.

This is yet another causality of the era... a disposable title completely geared toward online game play -- a title that won't even be playable in a few years.

The saddest thing is, GTA5 was BEAUTIFUL. The story was GREAT. I wanted to PLAY IT. Just when I started getting warmed up... it was over. There wasn't much left to do but the lamest of the ""busy work"" side missions like ""pearl diving"" (or whatever that was).

I think I had 87% completed in about a week. I played San Andreas for FOUR FREAKING MONTHS and only got to around 75%. That game was a blast to play... GTA 5 was a blast to play for a few minutes and then I was just left wandering around in that big, beautiful GTA world with nothing fun left to do.

If you want to actually PLAY an open world game rather than just preview one, I suggest Borderlands 2. It has the abundant game play and deep character development that GTA used to have. Playing that kind of inspired me to write this and vent my frustrations. I kept thinking maybe I was missing something. There had to be a reason why I wasn't enjoying GTA like I did back in the day?

The reason is, there is only a fraction of a game to play. It's basically a demo or an ""expansion pack"". Single player, open world games do still exist -- this isn't one of them. GTA V had so much potential... and most of it was completely omitted.

The battle aspect is a lot of fun and I like how you can choose 2 different weapons and be a hybrid of mage/warrior/rogue.  There is quite a bit of variety, but the annoying thing with the skills is you may have to level up a skill you don't want in order to unlock another skill.  For instance I wanted to use the Chakrams, but those are a mage skill.  They are also not a tier 1 skill so I had to level up one of the tier 1 skills in order to use them for my warrior.  It's not a big deal, but I dislike skill trees such as this.  The armor and weapon customization is probably the most fun aspect as there is near endless possibilities to work with.  There is a ton of different weapons and armor you can customize as well as plenty of unique armor sets to find treasure hunting.

The main problem I had with this game is it is way too easy.  I put the difficulty on the hardest level and was slaughtering the helpless enemies.  They really had no chance against my character who was pretty much god throughout the whole game.  It really made the experience less fun.  Also there are very few enemy types and fighting them gets old very quickly.  The enemies it does have are pretty uninspired I found it dumb how many cutesy little tree men I had to fight throughout the game.  I want to fight demons and terrifying monsters not these weakling tree men.  There unfortunately isn't any good boss battles really either none of the battles felt epic to me which is a shame considering how good and fun the combat is.

This game could have been one of the best if they didn't make it so easy and had some more interesting enemies to fight.  It gets fairly boring about 3/4 into the game you will be wanting to call it quits.

Unfortunately it was marred by an incredibly predictable plot, really bad dialogue and robotic voice acting. But it's one of those kind of games that you really want to admire if it wasn't for its faults and boy does this game have faults.

Story: There's a war going on and caught in the middle of it is Dart, a young warrior orphaned by something called the Black Monster. So Dart, his childhood friend Shana and an increasing number of friends have to battle evil to save the world yadda yadda.

Graphics: Keep in mind this is Playstation. That being said the in-game graphics look okay at times with certain environments looking nice at times but others look horribly bad. However where the game shines is its FMVs. That is the good ones, since some of them are literally looking at old manuscripts or images with a voice-over. Why they even bothered, I don't know.

Sound/Music: Fairly unimpressive. I forgot most of the tracks right away and like I said, the voice acting at times is incredibly stilted like they were worried of sounding too ""emotional"" during a recording.

Gameplay: Hm, well it's essentially the same as Final Fantasy games on the PSX, walk around screens, get into random encounters(that occur WAY too frequently).

The Bad: Story is very confusing, time manipulation isn't as fleshed out as it could have been, looks very dated

A lot of developers with risky ideas tend to get low funding, and in some rare cases, the game turns out well. Singularity is one of the those games with a low budget feel, but with AAA ideas. You play as a special ops agent named Nate Renko who is sent to an island called Katorga-12 and must stop the singularity. In 1955 Russians found a new element called E99 and tried using it as a new weapon to wipe out America. The experiments went wrong due to an evil and greedy man and a scientist who created it all. The story is pretty decent, but very hard to follow, and feels like something from a sci-fi TV series.

The game starts out kind of like BioShock or Half-Life, and even Fallout 3 with an introduction of excellent atmosphere and first person real-time narrative with movie reels, and the whole destroyed apocalypse feeling. It never really strays from this, but it does wear off fairly quickly and the game's atmosphere loses it's touch after you get further into the game.

The game has very fun gun play, but the weapons are what draw your attention and make you want to actually shoot stuff. You get your typical pistol, shotgun, assault rifle entourage, but there are other unique weapons like a grenade launcher that let's you control the grenade on the ground, so when you let go of the alt fire button it will blow up where you want. My favorite weapon is a mix of a sniper rifle and grenade launcher that let's you control the bullet and steer it. Watching enemies heads blow up or legs coming off is very satisfying and never gets boring.

While the guns are fun to shoot and feel powerful and satisfying it's the time manipulation that pulls the game's fun factor up. You find the TMD about 20% into the game and it lets you do a slew of things. Aging enemies into a corpse, bringing back stuff from time such as destroyed ammo crates, electrical boxes, aging safes to get inside, renewing crumpled stair cases etc. Another ability allows you to create a bubble and everything inside is slowed down, you can also use a telekinetic power to throw objects around as well as an impulse ability that pushes enemies away. The game allows you to use the TMD in large epic ways such as restoring a broken down train, but you always feel the TMD isn't used to it's full capacity.

You can upgrade the TMD with perks such as longer durations for powers, allowing extra energy when killing enemies, as well as upgrading weapons with more firepower, faster reloading, and bigger clips. While the upgrades are a nice touch they don't really make a huge impact like you would think and the game adapts to these upgrades too fast so you always feel like you're not quite powerful enough.

While it's neat to reverse time, and go back in time to stop things from happening then come back you always feel the TMD and the whole time manipulation thing isn't fleshed out enough. For example: There is a door in front of you that isn't quite open enough to crouch under so you age a metal crate, slide it under, the bring it back and it pushed the door open. Not very creative and I feel that all of these time elements could have been fleshed out more. This isn't the only game's problem, but the biggest one is it's looks. It uses the Unreal Engine 3, but looks kind of ugly wish flat muddy textures, and the only real thing going for it is the lighting.

The creature design is pretty neat, but there's not much variety and the story is very confusing. The game just loses it's strong appeal that you get in the beginning towards the end. Singularity is a bunch of gory fun, but it feels like it could have been a lot more if Raven had gotten a bigger budget. If you like FPS games and are a fan of BioShock, Fallout, or Half-Life then you'll appreciate what Singularity brings to the table, and can forgive its short comings.",A great concept plagued by reserved design,1332892800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

3.0,True,"08 13, 2013",A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B0009XBWY6,Moviedude,"Growing up in the 90s the Megaman X series was pretty defining for me. Overnight I went from playing classic megaman - a great franchise in its own right - to the 16-bit incarnation, visually lush games with over-the-top explosions, crazy weapons, and all the effects and colors and depth you'd expect from the SNES (and later PS1) generation of this series.

If you've not had the pleasure, Megaman X tells the story of Dr. Light's SECOND boy wonder robot. X is a reploid, an android with the power to make ethical decisions (this is a cloudy distinction since the Classic Megaman robots all had free will too, but the implication seems to be that the original Megaman had a predefined understanding of right and wrong and merely got to choose how he went about the right thing). X is buried in Dr. Light's lab for testing and recovered decades later. X becomes the prototype of a new generation of robots, but some begin to go maverick, becoming insane and hostile toward humans. This is exacerbated when Sigma, a military robot built to lead reploids against mavericks goes maverick himself. Once again, Megaman must Fight! For everlasting peace! This time he has some help though, in the form of Zero, Dr. Wily's attempt at a true thinking machine. Zero, and his beautiful rock hair, are playable from X3 onward.

This collection includes Megaman X 1-6, omitting the PS2 installments, which are crap anyway. All are solid games with great visuals for their eras and thumping soundtracks (the music walks an odd line between GNR 80s metal and classic NES chiptunes and is solidly great in all the games). Of course it's a Capcom game so the controls are tight beyond reproach, and purists will note the emulation of the older games here is actually a little SMOOTHER than how they originally played- for instance moments of lag when Zero's theme loads in X1 are totally absent here. Rockman Battle and Chase is an unlockable extra, but it's not very good and not why you'd buy this collection.

So this is a pretty great package and worth your money. But it does have one caveat: this game uses the same sub-SD video mode the original SNES games did. As such, if you are outputting to an HDTV or high-def capable receiver over component, there's a good chance your video will glitch to unplayability. This is a product of HD tuners not quite ""getting"" low def over component, and there are a couple fixes:
-Play the game on a first-gen PS3, which will cost you about $600 if you don't already have it
-Play the game over S-video or composite cable, which will make your picture duller and blurrier
-Get an upscaler VGA line-box for your PS2 which will certainly cost more than the game itself
-Connect your PS2 to a reciever that supports component OUT, WITH SCALING, so that your receiver can upscale the cruddy component resolution and your TV can make sense of it, which is a huge hassle and expense

Capcom easily could have scaled the game up- as they did with the Megaman Anniversary Collection. But they didn't, and for that reason I'm giving some of my favorite games of all time only 3 stars. That said, this is still the best (legit) way to play all the 2D X games, and for me it was worth stepping down to S-video. You be the judge!",Fantastic games with one hidden gotcha,1376352000,,,
3.0,False,"06 17, 2016",A1YSQMDKH0RX8L,B00M049CG2,M. Robert B.,"I give this game a 4 Star rating out of five, but I don't think that it is entirely honest. I don't think it earns the full 5 stars, but it out paces a 4 star rating. I would like to give it an 90 of 100. It is a good game. I need to stress that here, because I am going to tear into it now.

Uncharted 3 is an attempt to Out Indy the Indiana Jones stories. Where the first Uncharted was an homage to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Uncharted 2 was a kind of remake of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(Chasing a Russian army to a mythical city while dealing with a past love interest that re-enters your life). Uncharted 3 is Last Crusade. Starts with the flash back to being a kid and Drakes first adventure. You are accompanied by Drakes father(figure) of Sully,  Templars and Crusades and then off to the desert!
That being said, I freaking love Indiana Jones, so the story wasn't my gripe.

The Controls and Gameplay are dragging this game down. I said it.  The desire to give a Cinematic Game Experience hurts this game in a big way.

The new fight mechanic of being able to grapple and throw an opponent, leads to the opponent grappling you while his buddy takes a shotgun to your skull. Combat is much more strung along in this game. Sure, I missed the Brutal combo knock out from the first game, when we moved to Uncharted 2. But I still felt that U2s combat system worked very well. Uncharted 3s combat is a lot of button tapping and scripted moves. And when you have to watch the same 3-4 animations per fight, just leaves you rolling your eyes and wishing you could skip it. But hand to hand is the best way to defeat enemies in close quarters because

Nerf Dart Guns. That is what the game gives you. The .45 Defender that was the staple handgun of the series has been depowered to the point of being useless. The first heavy weapon is the AK47, the power and accuracy so bad, you would do more damage throwing the bullets at the enemies. I don't know if they are giving all the enemies body armor in this one or what, but the combat is frustrating. You can have an enemy charge at you, you place 3 rounds center mass, and he will keep walking right at you, firing the whole time. The AI is moronic. Both for enemies and for your companions. It will walk into the line of fire. Enemies will target Sully and walk right past you as you pump round after ineffectual round into them. And the targeting is slow. Even with the sensitivity cranked all the way up, the reticle takes precious seconds to more around. Not that it matters for the spitballs that you are throwing.

The True Villain of the game, is the Camera. To give the game the Cinematic Game Experience that I mention earlier, the camera will turn on its own for dramatic effect. This leads to it becoming locked and you cant move it. You cant move it to find a hand hold or see where you need to go. The game has a few sections where you are running towards the camera and away from things(people, bugs, burning buildingetc) and the camera will swing around so much that you will lose track of what direction you are moving or where the  obstacle are that you need to avoid. The flashback sequence in the beginning where you play as young Drake, running from some thugs. The camera tries to lead you where to go, but it does a poor job and causes you to miss turns or not see jumps.
The Camera also has some bounce in it. You can notice it when you walk. Maybe I am just more prone to noticing it because I have issues with motion sickness. But it is distracting. As is this weird shuffle/walk that Drake has developed since the last game. He moves slower and always seems like he is ready to take off running. There is also a new issue with landing from a jump, where Drake almost seems to topple forward, then catches himself before falling. It is an annoying animation that happens constantly. When you are attempting to move about the level, under gun fire, that animation forces itself to play, leaving you a sitting duck.
The game play is off as well. The game gives little in the way of direction. There are puzzles where you just push buttons until something happens. If it takes too long, the game gives you a condescending Hint that just tells you all the stuff that you already know. There are times that you will just jump at every wall, trying to find a hand hold, because there is little distinction between background and a handhold that you need. The last 2 games, sure they were a bright color and stood out like a sore thumb, but at least you could find them.

In the end, it is a good game for Uncharted fans(85%). For fans of the genre but not specifically the series, Id say a little lower (80%). At the time that I write this, the Uncharted Remastered edition has been released for the PlayStation 4 and I am interested to see if they fixed some of these issues. I will say that it was worth the money, since mine came bundled with my PlayStation 3. So, grain of salt with that.

UPDATE: Wow. So I wrote this review while I still had the goggles on from playing the first 2 in rapid succession. I was a little over halfway done with Uncharted 3 when this went up. I need to adjust my score for this game. I first said 4 stars, this is really a 3 star game. And I will tell you why I removed a star. As I mention above, the guns are useless and enimes are overpowered. In the later levels, it is nothing but snipers up above, heavily armed shotgun thugs on the flank, and 3-4 enemies lobbing grenades to force you out of cover. Sure, you now have the ability to throw a grenade back, but that only helps when you don't have 3 actual grenades and a grenade launcher round coming at you at the same time. This game really suffers from not knowing the relationship between Challenge and Difficulty.  Challenge is the actual task. Climb a mountain, race a car, jump across gap. Difficulty is obstacles in the way of completing those challenges. Snow on the mountain, other racers on the track, length of the gap. Uncharted 3's issue is that when the challenge is ""Kill these 10 enemies and get across this area"" the Difficulty is that all the enemies are pinpoint accurate shots that can see you from anywhere. Seriously. I was in the middle of a sandstorm and stealth killed a guy too close to another guy, causing the alarm to go up. And a machine gun turret from the other side of the map, that could not be seen due to the sandstorm AND a stone pillar between it and myself, began unloading a steady stream of fire at said pillar.
The game is substituting Difficulty for Challenge. If the Challenge was interesting, I would accept the difficulty. But the challenge is always, run from this cut scene to the next cut scene and we will throw a ton of over powered guys at you. Good Luck.
I still like the platforming and the puzzles. That is still engaging. But man, the combat sucks.","Third time isn't the charm, but not a bad effort.",1466121600,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I will say that the graphics are beautiful, the atmosphere is really great on many of the maps, and there are a few modes that I absolutely love.

I think that with the additional content on the way, the game will gain valuable depth... Although at a steep price tag (minimum $50 for the season pass).

That is, until you realize everyone should be a healer in some sub-job, and you should keep changing class to get more points in strength.  You control only one person in your party, and combat is 'real time' sort of like the Star Ocean series, but more simplistic.  Basically your character runs around and tries slash the enemy with their weapon or spends all their time healing your party.  You have one combo attack -- push the attack button twice.  Extremely repetitive.  Maybe if you loved Final Fantasy XII, you'll like the combat system.  I didn't.

The biggest problem is how you move the characters.  The directional buttons don't work in this game.  You have to move everywhere using the roll-o-ball covered in fabric below the directional pad on your PSP.  For me, this is so awkward I no longer wish to play the game.  It is terrible because the game's camera keeps trapping you in corners, and you end up going in diagonal directions half the time you want to go straight.

The story is bland (your main character has amnesia, and frequently says ""...""), and the monster variety is extremely low.  Think lots of similar enemies with color variations.

The difficultly is medium, in part because getting experience is a real grind.  (As in like 20xp or less per encounter when you have a full party).  Pick a healer and a fighter and your party is basically set.

I really enjoyed the developer's other PC game, ""Black & White,"" and if anyone on here liked Fable, then they should try ""Black & White"" as well. I wasn't sure what to expect with this RPG. The graphics turned out to be very nice. The hair on the characters was done very well - you can see many fine, individual strands of hair on the NPCs. Also, the game world itself is very lush. The game reminded me of the Zelda games for Nintendo Console, however with its own uniqueness. For one, Link in the Zelda games, could never choose an evil path. Another great thing about this game was the boasting option before going into a quest. This allowed you to do fun things like complete a battle while in your underwear for more gold, kind of a wager. I also liked being able to try and impress the ladies in the towns.

With all that being said, the game however did not impress me too much overall. Flirting with the local lasses was too easy. Also, when my character's scariness increased, all the female NPCs would cringe in fear. What about the dames who like the bad boys, where are they? Basically, the NPCs were too simplistic.

Overall, the game was fun and interesting. However, I don't think it was all the hype made it out to be. I've played lots of RPGs, and right now, I would say Everquest II is still the best, however it is an MMORPG so it is another league altogether. Fable was not much better than ""Morrowind"" to me when it comes to AI. Like I said the AI of the NPCs was still too simplistic.

I would give this game 75%, and if I could give more than 3 stars, it would be 3 1/2. I would probably give it a better percentage, if the game itself didn't cost so much. I can't totally slam this game though because it does have merits.",Good RPG but not worth 50$,1127692800,7,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

On a side note, I do hope for the next installment that they return to the original formula of having everyone solo. It's so much more enjoyable than everyone having to move at the same pace.

I used it on my SNES and NES. It's been very convenient to only have to use one AC adapter on my powerstrip. My Nintendo and SNES sit side by side and I can switch from system to system. Perfect! No switching cords or trying to get two adapters to fit on one strip. However, the connection isn't perfect with these two systems. There is a wavy interference that runs across the screen that is noticeable every now and then so it's definitely not the same quality as the original adapters.

Kane & Lynch 2 is a graphically improved game compared to its predecessor.
However, that's not saying much. Even though the game graphics look better, the designers decided to add a series of effects as if everything you see is being recorded through a camcorder. Your view shakes up and down, left and right as you move, sometimes the image becomes intentionally blurry, out of focus or even pixelated. After a few minutes of this you either want to throw up or desperately navigate the menu looking for the option to turn this off! Thankfully they did include a ""steady cam"" option which mostly removes these annoying effects. Without the steady cam, the game looks like a shaky blurry mess that won't let you focus on the action nor enjoy the game, kind of like the Cloverfield movie.

Another bad choice that the developers decided to implement was censoring some of the violence and all of the nudity in the game. For example, whenever you land a headshot, all you will see is a pixelated mosaic filter over the head of whoever you shot. Same thing happens with nudity. The designers included an entire episode where there is nudity only to have it all blurred out. I mean, c'mon. Isn't this game already rated ""Mature""? The censoring just seems like a stupid way of making players feel cheated out of getting the entire experience. Maybe once they realize they screwed up they will release a code or patch to remove this.

As for the story.... well there really isn't any. Kane & Lynch get together again, things go bad and the have to escape, The End. Don't expect to feel gratified by the time the game is over (the ending is pretty damn lousy, feels kind of like they ran out of ideas or time).

And finally the gameplay. From beginning to end, all you will do is shoot hordes and what seems like endless armies of generic baddies, soldiers and police in close corridors and alleyways with weapons that are extremely inaccurate. It gets old pretty fast as there is almost no variation. There is only one single level in which you get in a chopper and vary things a bit, but it all ends too soon and you're back to the same-old ""shoot the bad guy hiding behind the column"".

My conclusion of the Single player campaing is that ""Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days"" is just another generic shooter with hardly anything new to offer.

3.0,True,"09 13, 2010",AQS0FWGVAQ51C,B002BSC4ZS,TigerNightmare,"I'm going to be addressing G4's X-Play review by Abbie Heppe. First of all, this game and characterization of Samus Aran are NOT, I repeat, NOT sexist.  I don't know where she got that, which is absolute madness and can only assume she drew her own conclusions based on two particular scenes, one where Samus is suddenly a little girl (literally) and freezes up emotionally when she confronts Ridley and the other when she cries after a big event.

The Ridley scene wasn't exactly presented well, but I understood the context of it, referencing the murder of Samus' parents in front of her by Ridley when she was very young in the canonical Metroid manga.  So, here's this giant, flying fire-breathing monstrosity that not only killed your parents, but nearly killed you about five times and refuses to stay dead.  Wouldn't you be scared too?  The scene where she cries, if that was you, you would cry too.  The problem is that there wasn't enough character development for the relevant characters to matter to you.

The story does have some good things going for it, however.  Despite Samus' characterization seriously lacking any kind of depth, charm or anything resembling a truly likable character, they managed to somehow pull off a likable character in Anthony Higgs, a Galactic Federation officer and old friend of Samus.  The plot developments by the game's end are also intriguing.  Not only that, but an officer ends up missing and may or may not be the one Samus refers to as the Deleter, the one who betrays them all and the game never spells it out who the Deleter is and if it is this missing officer or not and it's a nice subtlety that lets you figure out for yourself based on what is shown.  On top of it all, the cut scenes are very well-animated.

I don't have a problem with Samus not using certain equipment until Commander Malkovich authorizes it.  They do a good job explaining why you can't use power bombs (devastating to humans, who you're trying to find, and you'd fry your buddies) but why can't you use the ice beam, the wave beam, the varia suit?  Even I could write better lame excuses for why you can't use what (the wave beam causes interference with survey equipment they're using, the varia suit can't calibrate with the damaged communications systems yet, etc.)  You aren't able to use almost any new equipment at all until you are logistically guaranteed to die unless you do so.  The most annoying example I can think of is when the game tells you to use shinespark to reach a high area, then you move through two tight areas across electrified grates with zoomers while in morph ball mode, and then you reach a dead end.  There's a switch visible through some windows that can be activated with the wave beam, but, no dice.  At this point, Samus should speak up and say, ""Adam, requesting the use of my wave beam. I can't progress any further without it.""  But no, despite her having a voice for the first time, she almost never uses it when she needs to.  So, you have to turn around and go back the way you came and that's when you're trapped within transparent walls while baddies fire *their* wave beams at you and you have to get shot at and run around in the box like an idiot for 20 seconds until Adam speaks up and says, ""Hey, stupid! Use your wave beam so you don't die, I'm authorizing you to use it.""  After you kill the bad guys and are freed, you have to go all the way back and do everything you just did over again to shoot at the switch.

The idea of the ""concentration"" technique isn't terrible, but its implementation is.  Let me just get it out of the way that it's more like a concentration of suit power and not a mental honing technique that X-Play was dumb enough to think.  The problem isn't the technique itself, but it's much like the crystal flash in Super Metroid, where the circumstances that allow its use are extremely rare, making it mostly useless because you can pick up power-ups from killed enemies.  Except that in this game, there are NO dropped power-ups at all, forcing you to rely on concentration and save stations.  Replenishing missiles is usually no problem and only takes 2 seconds, but, the only way to replenish your health is for you to be almost dying, which is usually too late.  You need to stand still for 4 whole seconds while critters are shooting and swiping at you.  I found myself jumping into lava and running into a weak enemy on purpose so that I can use concentration and survive an encounter with something stronger.  It was a funny sight to see.  ""Ah!"" thud.  ""Ah!"" thud.  ""Ah!"" thud.  Repeat ad infinitum.  It kind of makes hard mode (no expansions) a little less hard because most of the time, you'll be running around with just the amount of energy that concentration replenishes, which ranges from 99 energy to 3 full energy tanks if you picked up all the e-recovery expansions.  You'll find yourself avoiding and ignoring enemies instead of killing them in order to preserve your health.

The game also becomes unnecessarily frustrating because of multiple factors.  One is when you're forced into first-person perspective in order to scan something and you have to pixel hunt for something very small on the screen without any idea what it could be.  Another thing is how doors suddenly and inexplicably lock behind you, funneling you toward your objective without any consideration for your desire to explore and pick up expansions. One of the worst frustrations is how much damage certain cheap attacks do to you, the worst of which is the ""mystery creature"" fight where Samus is pinned down and forced to shoot missiles at the monster's tail in first-person mode before it strikes her.  2-3 hits and you're dead.

The worst thing about the game is probably the controls.  They work okay most of the time, but the desire for nostalgic sideways controller gameplay is not worth the annoyance in this game and somebody at Tecmo and Nintendo should have realized this and created controls using the pointer and nunchuk.  Samus aims for you, you just need to be facing the right direction with the D-pad.  You don't have a lot of control over which target you shoot at and worst of all, you are forced to use the clumsy first-person mode to fire missiles.  A lot of the time, you end up facing the wrong way, locking onto the wrong target or can't move the pointer and lock onto a target fast enough before it moves its vulnerability away from harm.  You can't move or dodge at all in first-person mode.

The graphics are very nice and a lot of familiar music cues are well done as well as some of the new original music.  But where's the item pick up theme that's been in every Metroid game until this one?  The voice acting is adequate, but the actress who plays Samus comes off as wooden, probably because of the material.  There's so much to nitpick in this game.  Things are glitchy, even.  Several times when I've died, Samus' body clips into the ground she's lying on and a couple times I've gotten stuck on things and once I was in a perpetual somersault when jumping over a dead tree-like creature until I moved the D-pad to nudge away from it.  The forced perspective often forces your enemies offscreen and you will run into walls you won't know are there.  The map system sucks.  The game also feels really short, as you should finish the main story in less than 15 hours and what feels like an expansion in another 5 (if you want to get 100%).  While that's longer than Super Metroid and all the games before it, it's much shorter than the standard set by the Prime series (25+ hours).

Metroid: Other M succeeds on many levels, but mostly fails where it counts the most: gameplay, controls and fun.  More time, effort, re-writes and better level design would've made this a much better game.  Worth a rental or a buy for diehard fans of Metroid after the price drops to under $30.

3.0,False,"01 28, 2013",A1MFVAHTT2BHM0,B00AR05D78,Gadget Enthusiast,"Age of Empires was a once successful franchise that began its downfall shortly after reaching its zenith in the AOE II series. The gameplay was beautifully constructed, the 2-dimensional battles of monumental proportions made one excited to hop on and fight against the computer, or better yet, actual opponents. Today still, people deal with modern-pc incompatibilities in order to experience this game play.

Age of Empires III takes you forward in time to the colonial period, involving lots of rifles and Native American settlements. You also receive by default (in skirmishes) hero characters with special abilities. Scattered across the maps are ruins that one can harvest for in-game perks. One is now able to gain experience, which allows you to call for supplies from your home country as you ""gain levels"".

I am quite honestly disappointed in the game play. It feels too pandering, even on difficult settings.

* You now only need three resources. Stone has been dropped from the game; instead you search for silver mines which harvest your gold (???). You are also able to build plantations, which provide you an unlimited source of money that can be harvested by 10 settlers for only a few hundred wood. Seriously? Why bother searching for any mines then?
* Food is now basically unlimited as well. While in AOE II you were forced to grow crops, you now just have mills that yes, ten settlers can indefinitely harvest food. You can see here now, that all you need to do is have your settlers start out chopping wood like mad (with a few harvesting food to make more villagers) and once you get your mill and plantation up in the third age, you're home free.
* Villagers no longer need to return supplies back to certain buildings. This means you can send someone across the map to chop wood, and it will immediately begin to trickle into your inventory. The same goes with the rest of the resources- no longer can you surprise your enemy's resource camps and kill them before they can return with their goods. Everything is automatically deposited.
* There are now 'cards' and 'experience' you can use. By doing pretty much anything in the game, you gain experience, which in turn allows you to send supplies and resources from your motherland. Need outposts? Even a fortress? Sure thing! Leveling up your home city also lets you unlock decorations to make it look prettier. It does not actually affect game play, so I consider this a horrible waste of time.
* Building limitations. You're limited to very few buildings in the skirmish mode, some of which you only get one. I say, if you have the resources, go ahead and build whatever you want! (On this note, fortresses also will train ANY unit you want, not only specials. I didn't like this feature either).
* Resource trade depots. Now on the maps, there are trade routes (that build from a simple cart up to a railroad, which looks buggy as hell when it reaches the end of the line and freezes before spontaneously disappearing) that if you claim one of the spots with your explorer hero, you are able to claim tribute each time someone passes by. This can be in experience, or any resource you want. As time passes the tribute increases. Soon you will be able to receive several hundred (to even a thousand) units of tribute from just one pass, if you're able to hold the depots. (Which isn't hard when playing against AI, they take their time getting to the depots, and ignore yours once you've built it).
* Native American Settlements. There are now settlements that you can 'claim' by building another trade depot. Doing this allows you to build additional warrior units from their tribes that does not affect your own personal population limits. They train quickly and cheaply, so if you're quick to grab these areas, you can easily raise 20+ ridiculously strong units in a very short amount of time.
*Science is easy. It shouldn't be. I'm able to upgrade the majority of my research by the time I'm nearing the end of my Third Age. I have accumulated so many resources that it's just a moment's work to sift through available research opportunities, and I'm able to research everything within a few minutes. This shouldn't happen so easily, should it?

The list goes on, but after several skirmishes on varied land, these changes from AOE II frustrate me. The game is now just too simple, too easy. Games that would normally last me a happy 5-6 hours now finish within 2-3. It's watered down, and even if I don't bother with using boosts from the home countries, I feel like there's no point.

On top of this, you still have some problems dealing with running the game on Windows 7/8 platforms. As a digital download that's even available on Steam, I feel as though Microsoft should have focused less on decorative banners and more on the compatibility of a game /DESIGNED BY THEIR OWN COMPANY FOR THEIR OWN OPERATING SYSTEM/.

But there are some good things about this game as well.

- The music in battle is great. They didn't spare much expense for this (instead of the warning trumpet in the last few games), and when you go into combat, a harrowing orchestra spins up from the depths of your computer's sound card, drawing you towards battle, as short as it is. You also hear the distant booms of cannons in the distance, signaling artillery attacks. These are nice additions to otherwise placid game play.
- The graphics are definitely an improvement. Buildings slowly take visible damage and have animated collapses. The three dimensional figures look great. (Though I would still enjoy AOE II's two dimensional figures if the game play had been up to par).
- You can actually download the game online! Very few of the AOE games are available for download, which is why I had to get AOE III to get my RTS fix... fixed. AOE II also takes forever to configure LAN/online games and requires lots of third party intervention, so I figured I might as well snag AOE III, because it couldn't be that bad compared to AOE Online, right? I wasn't wrong, but I wasn't very far from being wrong anyways.
- Bulk training. You can now train in groups of 5 military units. This means if you're in a rut and are being attacked, you are able to pump out five units to come out of your building at once rather than just one to face any enemies in the surrounding areas. This is one of the few changes in game play that I appreciate.

TL;DR - If you've never experienced AOE/AOEII game play, you should still be able to enjoy this game quite well. If you're hoping that AOE III will build upon the experience of the beautiful, medieval feel of AOE II, please don't expect much. The game play when compared is truly a let down, and for many people, you will find it just too simple and too placid.
For a scant amount of money that I paid for this game, it was worth a shot, as I love the AOE series the best. But I doubt I will play this game much longer, before returning back to AOE II. I feel too guided in the game, too limited and pandered. I'm not a child who is experiencing their first RTS.

To cite Ghost Recon as reference, you were able to plot and execute group commands quickly and on the fly though the use of a simple tac-map.

To be fair, my 4 year old son like this game, but what does he know? I have played all of the LEGO games except the Harry Potter series, and this is by far the WORST game. Even Batman 1 was better than this - and at the time, THAT was my least favorite.

UPDATE: The game has received an update since this review was written, see my comment below:

NEGATIVES: the introduction of talking characters - stupid. And it looks like the upcoming LOTR game is going to use the actual dialogue from the movies. I still don't know how I feel about that, but I liked it better the old way. Second, the cut scenes - long and boring. Third, the ""breaks"" between levels. After each level finishes your only option is to ""continue story"" you can't stop or go back to the ""batcave"" so even if you want to stop after a level - you can't.

Plus, when a story finishes, you have to run through Gotham to the next level. In other words, in the huge city you have to find it. Impossible for a little kid, next to impossible for me without any earlier instruction on how to read the HUD. Which brings me to - FOURTH, the HUD. There are like 6 symbols up there, I have no idea what any of them mean. Worthless.

Fifth - Vehicles. Are worthless. Do yourself a favor never jump in them. In Indiana Jones if they flipped over, you could flip them back, right side up -not here. They stay upside down forever. Also, you can get them stuck in lots of places. I drove the batcycle into a wall once and it stayed half in it. Which brings me to...

Sixth - glitches. Tons of them. My game froze at least 3x, and had characters stuck behind objects, or stuck INSIDE objects multiple times. I can't believe this game went through the same cross checks as the ones in the past.

Seventh - the game is SHORT. Probably a third the size of a normal LEGO game, here are the total levels:

  5A. Theatrical Pursuits
  5B. Harbouring a Criminal
  5C. Arkham Asylum Antics
  5D. Asylum Assignment
  5E. Chemical Crisis
  5F. Chemical Signature
  5G. Unwelcome Guests
  5H. Destination Metropolis
  5I. Research and Development
  5J. Down To Earth
  5K. Underground Retreat
  5L. The Next President
  5M. Core Instability
  5N. Tower Defiance
  5O. Heroes Unite

That's it. Your first time through, you've maybe solved 10% of the game. Now your job is to run all over GOTHAM (which is an enormous map) and ""find"" puzzles and extra characters so you can buy them (no store feature) so that you can go back into the game and finish the remaining 80%.

Eighth - GOTHAM is huge and ""same looking"" and there are no ""directions"" about where to go or what to solve. You just basically run around, get lost, keep checking the map to see where you've been and ""try"" to find things.

POSITIVE: the basic story of the game (once you're in it) is fun. But you can't ""finish"" any level unless you have LEX LUTHOR and his Deconstructor ray.

SPOILERS: Lex Luthor - District: Yacht Club Location: On top of the clubhouse itself. Battle: Punch him three times while avoiding his Deconstructor. Price: 250,000

Joker is in the District: Ace Chemicals, Location: On top of the main building, just above the terminal. Battle: Joker will grab you with his electric buzzer just like in the story  battle.  Switch to the other character and punch him three times. Price: 250,000

I've play a lot of games on PS3 and with this one you'll ask yourself if this game deserve your time, because in other games like NGS or MGS4 you don't need to ask yourself this kind of things.

The worst thing about the game are the long load time to start in one town and or moving trough places like the room with the professor just to give him a souvenir with the expectation to beg just one new medal to open a new level.

3.0,False,"06 25, 2009",A11VIKSJ5L4MC4,B001989B4S,Marvelous,"Does EA have the capability to introduce new features in games, without taking away from elements that made previous titles great? More and more often it seems like EA keeps taking it's most popular titles, and send them rolling down hill. I'm not saying FNR4 is a bad game, but my first impressions, and hours after playing seem unstatisfied

The graphics of course are very much improved, with new physics displaying real life damage, and flexing when the fighter is throwing punches. One set back with the presentation is the fighters just seem too cartoonish at times, and no matter that round it is, it seems like each fighter just finished a 20 mile run. They just look too shiny, and thus adds to the cartoon effect.

The sound is exactly what your use to if you played the previous titles in the series, really nothing new here. Except they did a wonderful jon with the soundtrack, I would have to say this is the best EA trax mix we've heard to date in the series.

The fighting is the part that bugs me the most. There are many things that make in the ring a great experience, but 2 elements completely ruined it for me. 1. What is the deal with the foot movement? Remember in Round 3 when you could circle around your opponents, and keep a very fluid movement? Not in Round 4, it's as if your fighter is boxing in aradillo boots! i couldn't believe there wasn't a smooth movement involved at all, no matter how quick I double tapped the left analog stick, he would barley move. 2. The button configuration, EA took the ability away to pop shots off with the buttons, wtf?!?! I hate the total punch control, there is nothing realistic about it, and it has a delay to boot. People can't talk to me about it being realistic; I've been boxing for nearly a decade now, and I can vouch that if you are a pro boxer, I can promise you popping off a quick punch combo is just as easy as popping the buttons. At least they are lined up to the left and right, so you have a sense of which is left and right hand.

Other ring features are also subpar in my eyes. Like when you clinch now, there is no way to break the clinch, both guys just stand completely still in the middle of the ring and are released after about 10 seconds. Come on, is each clinch really going to play out the same??? The corner game is the other feature that totally let me down. After Round 3 where you can manually heal your guy, it is now replaced with a point system. How does that feed into realism? Not only that, but you are't even shown your opponents corner so you can see what kind of damage you've inflicted on them... The new stand up feature is a nice touch, leaning left to right with the left stick and standing straight up with the right stick. Also the punches don't feel all that strong, which brings me to the KNock out Replay... After bragging on and on of how they fixed this so that it wasn't as repeitive as Round 3, they didn't? The final knock out punch doesn't even match the booming sound when replayed, it's off and thus ruins the full relay experience, also at times the glove didn't even fully connect.

Finally the legacy mode... Isn't great, but isn't bad neither. You have te option to create a fighter or if you have the Xbox Vision Camera, you can take a photo and download your self into the game. I took the photo, but the download takes a few minutes to process. Also be prepared to be patient when going through all the customizations. For every one thing you change, it has the load to the haircut, or change of shorts, for every one thing you change, you are waiting a few seconds in-between. I felt this threw off the flow of the game, also the navigation throughout legacy isn't the best, why they feel they need to put so much out there to confuse us on what to do will always boggle me. Why they even give an option to simluate a fight rather than acually fight is beyond me.

All and all i didn't find myself as impressed and as entertained as I was when Round 3 came out years ago. As previously stated, they gave us many new options, but took away from small features like believable foot movement, or being able to change the haircut you gave your fighter when creating him. I was lucky enough not to pay for this game, as I traded in selected titles at gamestop to get Round 4 for free, had I have paid $[...] bucks I would have felt cheated. Some people will disagree with me, but I also think many will agree with me that they screwed up when it comes to configuration, good job EA, you probably lost many loyal fans once again.

UPDATE 08/25/09

So it's been 2 months since the release of this game, and I finally went back and started playing it again within the past couple weeks. Let me state for the record that I retract th3e majority of my previous statements. I have finally come to appreciate the new total punch controls, and I honestly feel like I won't even use the buttons when the patch is uploaded.

I think I spent too much time complaining about the change, that I didn't take enough time to really enjoy it for what it was. I was too set in my ways of ""button mashings"", and I just wanted round 4 to be just like 3 with a new paint job. I'm so relieved that I've come to my senses, and I can honestly state that the new total punch control is definitely the most intuitive play for the sweet science. I'm still not very fond of the cartoonish look of the boxers, but you can't neglect that they've incorporated all aspects of what happens in the ring realisticlly.

Part of the issue was that, yes, it's really, really hard.  I went in knowing this, so I don't know that I can criticize the game on that basis.  However, I there are a bunch of game design choices that I didn't agree with.  Basically it comes down to the fact that Demon's Souls hides the ball too much.  You want to make a really hard game?  Fine.  But don't also make it really hard to figure out what is going on, where to go, how to get better gear, etc.  Don't make an interface filled with symbols that I need to have the manual in front of me to even interpret.  This game would basically be unplayable without using the internet for help.

My first big problem is why, in 2011, make me replay the entire level every time I die?  I don't know about you, but after I get home from work I don't want to torture myself by replaying the same level 20 or 30 times to try to kill a boss whose patterns can only be learned through trial and error.  I'm happy to just fight the boss 30 times in a row, and I did just that in God of War III.  I knew about the replaying the whole level thing before I got the game, but I underestimated how annoying it would be.

I realize that even the recent Mario games have the same mechanic, but Mario is different because the levels are MUCH shorter and because you could, in theory, get through most of the levels in a few tries.  Mario doesn't have so much trial and error and is more about having good reflexes.

Demon's Souls has a lot of trial and error. Yes, I realize that it's also very much about reflexes and definitely skill, but there's stuff in the game that's going to kill you no matter what the first time you face it (especially bosses)...and when it does you have to replay the whole level to try again.  And get killed again.  In my opinion, that's not fun, and it's bad game design. If you have good gear maybe this isn't true--and that leads me to my second problem.

The game is completely obtuse about telling you anything.  It doesn't explain where or how to get better gear, learn spells, or do anything else.  It doesn't even really give you any hints.  You could only find better gear or progress by going through a horrific amount of trial and error or by looking it up online (which I did before I even put the disk in).  I would bet 99.9 % of people look stuff up, but I'm judging the game based on the idea that it should stand on its own.  I don't think it's really hand holding to at least suggest to you where you might find decent gear or that you might want to save those Demon's Souls (I saved them because I looked it up first, but what if I hadn't?).

Last, and I doubt that anyone could really disagree with this point, the interface absolutely sucks.  It's harder than it needs to be tell whether one weapon is better than another, what the stat modifiers do, or really much of anything about the gear you are using. Why make me memorize all these little symbols on the inventory screen? You can't just write ""this weapon adds + 10 to strength?"" like every game I can remember playing in my life?  There are probably 20 year old games with a better, more intuitive interface. Diablo 1 is like 15 years old and is 100 times better. Same thing goes for world tendency--what person would actually figure this out on their own?  Nobody.  This game would be unplayable without the internet.

This is why I bought a Wii U. Starfox is the reason I've bought every Nintendo system. Starfox is love, Starfox is life.

Unfortunately, this particular one has to be the second worst one in the series, with command still holding the lofty title of absolute worst. The game would actually be fantastic if they hadn't tried to shoehorn motion controls in, because they just don't work.

Occasionally, VERY occasionally, they help. Most of the time, though, it feels like I'm fighting the arwing/Walker/landmaster more than I am fighting the enemies. You can sort of disable motion controls for flying in the arwing, but they are required for the gyro, Walker, and landmaster for looking up and down. The control pad keeps going off center, the aiming is fiddly, and having to look at the gamepad constantly actually puts you at a disadvantage during complicated fights because you can barely see what's happening.

This all comes before even mentioning that this is just a reboot of Starfox 64. I can accept retconning Krystal, but I can't accept the fact that after three other games in the series that advanced the plot and universe building, I'm back at square one with a bunch of references that feel forced. I already played Starfox 64, I didn't buy a brand new system 19 years later to play it again in slightly higher res with a clunky control scheme.

Unless they patch the motion controls completely out, avoid this game. It pains me to say this about the series that I love more than any other gaming franchise, but it takes one step forwarx and twelve back.","A great game in theory, let down by an awful control scheme",1461283200,4,,

On the other hand, for kids and casual gamers it's not a bad game.

First, this game is short and easy. For anybody who's played through the Legend of Zelda games, this will probably take less than 10 hours to beat and you will probably die only once or twice. There aren't really any puzzles, and even if there are the game system has a clue system that makes sure you never get lost. Even within that much of it is spent with boring ""fetch"" quests, i.e. Aragorn has to find something and return to somebody for a reward. Only in front of the Black Gates do you get the sense of an epic battle. In many other stages, the number of enemies is fairly low and things move pretty slowly.

Graphically, the game is a mixed bag. I love the mix between the realistic and cartoonish styles. The pastel color schemes are particularly beautiful. Also, the Hobbiton cutscenes and levels are stunning (for the Wii). However, most of the other levels and characters have good, not great, graphics. The non-Hobbiton cutscenes are abysmal, with some sequences in which the characters' mouths don't even move.

Another thing the game gets right is the Wii controls. The swordfighting is pretty intuitive and works pretty well. This game isn't Motion Plus, but it does allow to to swing your sword left or right, up or down. I thought the bow and arrow and spear could have been used a bit more, but as it stands they work well with the Wii remote. You might even find yourself getting a bit of a workout.

I imagine for kids and casual gamers though this will be a nice, short romp through Middle Earth. It retells the story of Lord of the Rings succinctly and allows you to replay the key moments.

3.0,False,"01 4, 2004",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B0000C7GHG,Tsanche,"The PS2 has incredibly good games and the biggest library of all the consoles but as my title says, it is the system itself that needs some help.  The PS2 requires more patience and you've got to do more to take care of it!
What I'll start out with first are the graphics.  The PS2 came out in 2000 and for then these graphics are great! But you start to notice a few things.  The first being that the graphics are incredibly blocky when compared to that of the XBOX or Gamecube. They're not as smooth.  Not only that but the PS2 runs INCREDIBLY slow at times.  Some games you'll see it loading for quite some time.
Second, the system isn't all its cracked up to be when taking care of it.  I've already had my PS2 break on me twice!  Apparently, Sony didn't tell people that putting it in the verticle stance could move your eye and damage your mother board.  Leave it in the horizontal position it's much safer that way. Also, you have to take your system in to get cleaned...A LOT. After a while the console will stop reading blue-disc and PSOne games.  After that, your DVD player kicks out (which also means DVD PS2 games won't be played) and you'll need to clean the lense.  I haven't had to clean out my XBOX or GCN ONCE since I got them and they're going on to being three years old! It doesn't even take a year before I have to clean out my PS2 again.
Thrid problem, you have to go out and purchase a memory card! This wouldn't be such a problem if they weren't so damn expensive!  All it's used for is for me to save the data of a game!  Why do I need to pay more for the memory card than I do the controller?
This isn't really a problem but this console doesn't come with a game. I remember that when I purchased a PSX I got a demo disc showcasing its games. This doesn't include one. Not a problem but the overall cost will come out to be quite a bit when you've got to buy the console, a game, a memory card and second controller.
Also, the game only has two controller ports!  Forcing you to buy a multitap. The good news, many games only support two players so its not a total loss and you won't HAVE to buy a multitap.
Also, just because it's backwards compatible with the PSOne doesn't mean your PSOne controllers will work flawlessly. Some games will actually require that you use a Dual Shock 2 controller instead (since the original PSX controller doesn't have Pressure sensative buttons). But your PS2 controller WILL work with your PSOne.
But the selection of games on the PS2 are great.  Many games are worth the buy, really they are.  There are also many genres to choose from.  The casual RPGer will be quite at home here with his or her PS2.  So the games are great and because its been out a year longer than the other two it has a larger selection of games.
The system also has nice backward compatibility.  You can play just about any PSOne game on here.  What are the chances that you'll have one of the sixteen games that don't work? And even they play on the PS2 with little to no problems.
However, the PS2's cons do hold it back quite a bit.  The system is flawless as far as games go, several great games out there to choose from, but the system itself isn't all that special.
So the Good
+Backwards compatible with your PSOne (even the controllers)
+Good selection of games
+Hey, it's a DVD player, PSOne, CD player and PS2 all in one!
But the bad
-You'll still need to buy a Dual Shock 2 Controller since some games don't support the original Dual Shock 1.
-Putting the system in the vertical stance means the possibility of damaging your mother board AND moving the lense exists which means you may need to get it repaired if you put in this position. DON'T put it in the vertical stance unless you have a vertical stand.
-Only two controller ports
-System needs to be cleaned often
-LONG load times
-DVD's skip from time to time. Might as well use a regular DVD player
-Memory cards aren't all that cheap",A great selection of games and all but its the system itself,1073174400,8,,

Original Review:
The Charging station
The charger has 2 slots to put batteries for charging and 2 slots to put the remotes with the batteries on them. There is an on/off switch on the back. Unplug your Wii AC adaptor and plug the chargers cable adapter in its place and then plug the Wii AC adaptor in the chargers cable adapter that is plugged into the Wii. I did not plug mine into my Wii, I just used a 12volt ac/dc adaptor(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-Adapter-Power-Supply-12VDC-1A/dp/B006GEPUYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall Adapter Power Supply - 12VDC 1A</a>) that plugs into the wall instead and that worked just fine.
Charging
On the back of the batteries it said and I quote ""Note! Before using your battery pack for the first time, you must charge the battery over 12 hours or else the battery life will be reduced!"" Other than that, those are the only instructions that came with it. I was able to put the remote on the charger without taking off the wii strap and just rolled up the wii jacket instead of taking it completely off. When I started the 12hr charge, the light was red (indicates batteries are charging), and about 2 hours later it was blue (which is supposed to indicate the batteries are fully charged), but I kept them charging all day anyway.
Putting Batteries On
After the charging was done I put them on the remotes. I have 3 remotes. 2 are official Wii remote plus controllers, the other is a 3rd party remote. The batteries fit with little effort on the 3rd party remote and is easy to remove. On the 2 Wii remote pluses, they are easy to put on, when removing them it seemed like they were stuck but they came off just fine.
My test
With the batteries fully charged I tested 1 of the batteries out for 2 days. Each day I played games for about 2 - 4 hours at a time. After day 1, the battery power went down to 50%. At the end of day 2, the battery power left was 25%. I recharged it over night and it was ready to go in the morning. (Edit: I don't think it takes all night to recharge, that's just how long I left it charging. Obviously the less battery power left the longer it takes to recharge.)
Overall, so far I'm very happy I bought it. I'm hoping it continues to be useful over time.

3.0,True,"04 11, 2016",A1XENCCWK3C5T0,B00CMQTTZ2,J.S.,"Quantum Break is best described as a 5-act time travel movie that has some gameplay in it. The game attempts to blend an excellent story with a third-person cover-based shooter interspersed with QuickTime events. The first three acts are light on the shooter aspect, focusing more on story building and training the player on the powers mechanics. The last two acts are very shooter heavy and are poorly done.

Story  5/5
Ive always been fascinated with time-travel stories and this one is was GREAT! Each act ends with a live action sequence examining the story from the other point of view. What a terrific way to get us to care for Liam and Paul.

Graphics  5/5
The graphics are outstanding, and the 20-minute live action sequence show at the end of each act is excellent. However, there are plenty of times where the video frame rate drops and becomes choppy.

Audio  4/5
Audio is acceptable. There are times during the in-game flashbacks where the audio is difficult to understand.

Gameplay  2/5
The gameplay is just awful. Taking cover during the shootouts is sloppy and unpredictable. The platform puzzles during time stutters are a jarring mess.

But what is unforgivable is where the developers decided to put the restart checkpoints. Having to watch the same cinematic over and over again because of a restart is simply unacceptable. There are four places that are in dire need of better checkpoints: the shipyard, the platform bridge, the underground garage, and the ending. The ending battle isn't necessarily that hard, but Pauls ability to one shot the player causing the player to have to kill the initial waves of baddies over and over each time is truly frustrating. A restart should have been placed at the last wave.

Overall  3/5
I ended up giving the game an average score because I loved the story. On the plus side its a short game (20 hours), which doesnt drag out the story (or the terrible gameplay).

3.0,False,"03 9, 2012",AEOZ4EQQG10I3,B006FRNAAE,C. H. Mauricio,"Ridge Racer on the PlayStation Vita is quite a controversial entry for this long running franchise. It's an experiment of sorts on what you call an a la carte business model where the price of entry is relatively low, but in turn, you can make it as large as you want for a fee. This business model has been done predominantly on iOS software, in fact, Ridge Racer Accelerated offers you more features as DLC for a fee.

So right off the bat, here is what you get with Ridge Racer whether you purchase the card, or the PSN digital download.

- Three race courses originally taken from Ridge Racer 6, Harborline 765, Highland Cliffs, and Southbay Docks.

- Five cars, customizable to Standard, Mild, or Dynamic drift styles.

- Seven brand new songs.

The starter content allows you to race offline and a first for the franchise, online racing on a portable platform.

Since the game lacks content, Ridge Racer on the Vita is more of an MMO style racing game. You are asked to form allegiance to one of four teams. And your overall goal is to commit to this team by winning races whether it be on or offline. Everything you do in this game counts for something in a global tally that racks up points. Global goals change on a daily basis, one day you could form alliance with other teams to jump on one opposing team, the next, all teams all of a sudden make an alliance against you.

On a personal level, there is also growth in form of leveling up to get faster maximum speeds and earning points to gain access to perks. These perks range from different types of nitrous charges, increased level of slipstreams, or automatically get rocket starts in the beginning of the race. Lose too much on or offline, you potentially could degrade yourself to a lower level so there is risk of not performing well.

Because I play on the Japanese version, Ridge Racer has since received several major updates. I purchased the first season pass for a low price of 1000 Yen which gives me access to all premium updates from February all the way to the end of April. The game will continue to get bigger and bigger then.

This game is definitely not for everyone. Not even for all fans of Ridge Racer. I personally don't mind the DLC heavy structure of this game. It's hard, no, impossible to defend this kind of business but I just have grown to accept it. There is always the option of not buying, I like Ridge Racer, I have money, I can spend it on what I want. The gameplay is still FUN and playing Ridge Racer online anywhere (I have a Mifi device from Verizon which lets me use 4G LTE signals into wi-fi) is a blast.",Ridge Racer a la carte (JAPANESE VERSION REVIEW),1331251200,,,

I have been a long-time fan of the Banjo-Kazooie franchise, which may have tainted my expectations, but as I kept playing I kept struggling to find something that would keep my attention.

- GRAPHICS: The game looks very good in a technical sense, but I really don't like the art direction, which is entirely a personal preference.  The characters feel more box-like than in previous Banjo-Kazooie games.
- CONTENT: There is a lot to do in this game.  Level designs are huge, generally quite gorgeous, but almost a little too big for my taste.  The level size alone makes vehicles critical to the game design.  I didn't try multi-player at all, so I can't comment on that.
- VEHICLE CREATION: I really, really wanted to like the vehicle creation mechanic but for some reason it didn't set well with me.  I would love to be more specific but I don't know what it is that annoyed me about it because I typically enjoy tasks like that in most video games.
- CONTROLS: The vehicle controls feel a bit sloppy, but functional nonetheless.  Other platforming controls feel good and are responsive.
- AUDIO: I like that they kept the original style animal grunts, chirps, and squawks that we saw in the original game.
- STORY: I didn't like the storyline and can honestly say that it drove me away from the game.  Even for a mascot platformer game it felt really contrived.
-

The game did make an honest attempt at adding something new and refreshing to the platform genre.  I think it succeeded, but I just didn't like it.  Essentially, I think that this is probably a good (possibly very good) game that I just happen to have some unidentifiable personality conflict with.  It seems pretty obvious that my opinion is in direct contrast with the popular consensus on this game, so there's a pretty good chance that I'm just wrong in my conclusions.

The graphics really show you the power of the PS4. Controls are super easy to pick up. Tutorial board at the beginning really warms you up for the rest of the game. A few annoying points:
- No camera control is a bit annoying in a few parts where you wish the camera would just go a LITTLE to the right.
- In two player mode, the second player can get killed entirely too quickly. The more bad guys that player kills the more power they get, but if you aren't very good (or a much younger player) the quick deaths get annoying fast
- The hidden treasures can give you things you don't need and already have too much of. I still haven't collected all of the diamonds.
- I thought the story was a little predictable

On a related note, the companion iOS game (bejeweled clone) is a good way to get some of the treasures before you even start the game. If you like Bejeweled, this can be fun.

- Graphics are impressive with good lighting effects and nice scenery blur as speed ramps up.  The cars look great, with realistic reflections.

- Races are fast paced and fun. There are a good variety in the type of races, from drag runs to point-2-point to circuit races.

- Car customization is just right. There are enough upgrades, both performance and visual, to spend hours pimping your ride. I love the interior customization, all the way down to trim/fabric colors, lighting, etc. Its really impressive that they modeled the original stock interior for all these cars!

The Bad:
- Maybe I'm in the minority, but I hate having to drive around to find races. This isn't GTA, I just want to race. It is a real pain having to track down the race you want, flash your brights, etc.  Sure it may seem more realistic, but again this isn't GTA.

- The pedestrians are idiots and don't add anything to the gameplay.

- Music is so-so

- Car selection could be better.

- Car physics are completely unrealistic and get quite frustrating after a while.

Voice acting is done by the actors who play the characters in the movie, which adds a lot to the feeling. In addition, characters are modeled on the actors, which adds a lot as well. The game itself does not take too long to play, though going for 100% (I didn't) adds considerable time. Most of the side quests are quick, though I recommend having a walk-through that shows what spells should be cast on what items. The spells themselves are not that difficult once you practice with them. (The motions for the dueling spells are the same as for the non-combat spells, so there aren't too many motions to learn.)

And now to the bad... The player has almost no control of the camera, and the game's camera controls are pretty bad. It isn't uncommon to lose Harry, Hermione, and Ron behind scenery and have to run around until the camera adjusts enough to see them. Controls for the gobstones mini-game are horrible, as there is not fine control of the flicks. (I highly recommend using a free Web-based chess site, like [...], in order to beat the 3 chess champions.) Targeting items and people with spells can be difficult is Harry is standing too close or too far away from the item. In addition, unless you have a walk-through, determining which spells to use when is largely a case of hit or miss. (Some, like broken items or torches, are obvious. Others are not.) A lot of time is spent running from place to place, though if the player set out to get all the secret passage passwords first thing, that would help some. Going from place to place can be tricky, as Hogwarts students stroll around and often get in the way of the party. It is possible to push through them, but it slows the game down. Meanwhile, unnamed Slytherins constantly call out snide comments like ""Been in the Prophet lately, Potter?"" or ""Weasley is our King."" The same phrases got old very fast.

The worst part of the game is the ending. Almost the entire part at the Department of Mysteries is done as cutscenes. The one part the player has control of, Dumbledore's fight with Voldemort, turns into the player waiting for V to power up, then casting a defensive spell to dodge V's power shot, then sitting around waiting again. It took at least 5 deflected shots (done correctly) before that part of the fight ended and the next began - which was just more casting protective magic to dodge V's attacks. Meanwhile, V and D are repeating the same lines over and over, which got very repetitive.

3.0,False,"09 29, 2014",ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0016GABR4,Micheal Hunt,"Having played Motorstorm, and Apocalypse, I came to the conclusion that these games are good, but I seem to lose interest in the end and never end up completing the game because it's just racing the same thing over and over again in a different style of vehicle, so you need to work out a new path to choose to win. Seeing this one with Monster Trucks made me give another Motorstorm installment a try, and it was pretty much as expected.

Yes, the graphics are great. Lots of beaches, jungles, dirt, mud, waterfalls and volcanoes, the scenery is great, as always with these MS games. The vehicles look decent, only as usual, I wish I could have more colors/paint-jobs and what not to choose from. There is never any complaints in the graphical department of these MS games, they do the best they can and don't get lazy and just fill in things with sprites and pixelated images.

The sound is fine, everything fits and has no off putting sounds. However the music I found clashed with the sounds, so I just muted that.

The controls are fine, they handle as expected, but what these games really need is a handbrake option. It may just be my own personal preference, but I think GTA5 has really pathed the way in how racing controls should become standard.

So no complaints so far, but there always is. The first thing is something that bugs me about every MS game. The way you compete in events. You are presented with 4 areas of racing, with only 2 events currently open in each. In order to open new events, they require to you win races, obviously. But that really sounds like such an old method these days that is just worn out and boring. Win to get to the next stage. I'd be OK with it if you entered an event and it was one race starting after the other, then when they are done, you open them for free mode or something, but this tiresome old way of doing it in these games is really no fun. Especially when there is only about 4 different tracks to each of the 4 events. making it about 16 tracks in total for the game. But having to race those same 16 tracks over and over and over again in designated vehicles becomes a drag on the fun factor and becomes boring fast.

The other thing is you only start off with certain vehicles, and then you unlock more as you rank up. The only way to rank up is to win races, or at least place in the top 3. But what is annoying is if you win bronze, you get the amount of points for bronze, but then if you repeat the race and earn silver or gold, you only get about 25 to 50 points which is how many more points it was than bronze. So you can only unlock a maximum amount of points in each race. And that is the ONLY way to rank up. What makes it worse, of you repeat the race, and place 1st, 2nd or 3rd, and you've already gotten gold, you are awarded no more rank points. Once you have obtained those points, there is no more to earn in that race. And racing is the ONLY way to earn any RP points to rank up. That to me is pure BS. The developers are saying, win gold in every race you are presented with to open the next few. So you are forced to play every event, and some events you may not like. For me personally, I hate speed races, which is a solo gate crash race to hit every check point. Those should be bonus games to me, I never find them fun in any game personally.

Then there is the lack of race types. For the most part it's racing in a field of 16 competitors. But the only other events are, as mentioned, Speed, and Elimination, where you better not be in last place when the timer counts down or you will be eliminated, until the final car is left. A fun race, but that's it! Just those 3 races! So I can't imagine this game was much of a fan favorite in the multiplayer modes... which btw is annoying as it's vertical split screen, with no option for horizontal like some of us prefer.

One other thing that annoyed me was the camera views. there is only 2 views to choose. One from a driver POV in the cabin, and one behind the vehicle. Which is pretty standard, sure, but it badly needs an option to allow you to lower or raise the camera view to where you like it, because when racing as a large truck, you can't see anything in-front of you from the rear cameras angle, and you just crash into things and come of the track unless you memorize every last inch of the track. Which is another annoying thing, you have to do just that before you can win races because things just come out of nowhere and stack/crash you.

Overall, it's a decent game, but far from reaching it's full potential. If you have played the other MS games, this one is no different in physics and control. If racing in new environments interests you, then it's going to be a great game. But if you're like me, and just can't be bothered repeating the same things over and over again to achieve nothing in the end, then yeah, it's just an OK game that I probably won't ever play again in future.",Motostorm... the one with Monster Trucks,1411948800,,,

I played Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on the PC and absolutely loved the game.  It was my favorite FPS (first-person shooter) hands-down and probably my favorite computer game of all time.  I was thrilled to see that with the exception of the D-Day Normandy level, Frontline was completely different than Allied Assault.  I was not thrilled to see that the graphics in Frontline paled in comparison to Allied Assault.  Enemies and textures are much more animated, almost cartoonish on the Xbox, and given what I had seen in Splinter Cell and Halo, this was a letdown.  I know the Xbox has better graphics capabilities than this. Walk through a bush in Frontline and you get a ""pixelized"" graphic that looks like it was created in Paint, not by a professional graphics artist.
In Frontline, the only time you can save is before and after each level.  There are appropriately placed health packs, but they won't help you if you run in to a tank or enemy with a rocket launcher. I found that many times, you had to run in to an ambush and die to understand strategically how to get past it the next time. This wouldn't be as frustrating if you had even one save per level. Believe me, at least once you'll get 95% through a level only to die and have to restart.  And you'll probably take your frustration out on the controller. I just feel that this is a poor way to make the game longer and/or more challenging.
There are faults with the AI that I didn't see in Allied Assault or among the better games on the Xbox.  Case in point: open a door and two enemies are waiting, if one sees you, you can cap him and the second one won't even react.  Huh??  There was another time when I couldn't shoot a sniper because I was too far away from him.  If I can see him in my scope, he should take damage regardless.
Having said the negative points, I'd like to offer some positives.  The sound in this game is better than any other Xbox game I've played. The sound effects are excellent, and there is also some movie-quality, heroic music that plays during key points of the game. The levels are very diverse and well thought out.  I like how you can scope any weapon to get a slightly better view of your enemy, but if you do so, you can't move.  I felt like a true soldier in this sense. The controls are natural and enjoyable.  I love the scoping of the sniper rifle.
If you can accept the shortcomings, Frontline can be an okay experience.  I think those who haven't played Allied Assault on the PC would enjoy the game more.  If you have, just don't expect it to be nearly as mind-blowing as Allied Assault.",3 1/2 stars... I'm a little disappointed,1041811200,,,

3.0,False,"03 3, 2008",A3S9DOTT4Z8JF9,B0010YOQIC,Amozarte,"I like what Square Enix is going for in this title, and it's certainly a great example of a game experience you can only get from the Wii. However, the game does come with a few flaws that relegate it to good, not great.

The hook for this delightfully old school RPG is the real-time, motion controlled battles. You use the Wii remote to set a target point on the screen and then use a variety of slashing motions to take down the bad guys. While this is moderately well-executed and succeeds on some fronts, like many Wii games, it leaves much to be desired.

For example, I like the fact that direction of swing has a strategic element. For example, if your target has a shield and you swing starting from his shield side, he'll most likely block the shot. On the other hand, if you strike from above you might bypass his shield entirely. What I don't like is that the sensitivity is entirely too picky, which will leave you flailing your arms wildly without effect in many cases.

As for the story, Square was shooting for a very basic, entry-level RPG. Don't expect this to be on par with any of the heavy-hitting RPGs, but that's not meant as a negative. The story is 100% what you'd expect from a Dragon Quest title and the characters are charming.

The graphics, on the other hand, are downright poor- even for the Wii. If the world were a sandbox environment I would understand, but since exploration outside of town takes place on rails, I really expected more. And speaking of exploration, be prepared to do it all with the D-pad, no nunchuck.

Back to the positive, I really loved the decision to sprinkle in some sound effects from the original Dragon Quest. I grinned when I heard the old familiar ""clip-clop"" of my character climbing stairs.

Overall I recommend this game, albeit possibly more as a rental than a purchase.  Anyone looking for some nostalgia with an innovative mechanic mixed in really should at least take it for a test drive.

3.0,False,"08 16, 2008",A2W6SI073FIRMA,B00005RKO7,Amazon Customer,"Silent Hill 2- Restless Dreams
Restless Dreams is almost the exact same game as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playstation-version/dp/B00005ME6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playstation version</a>&nbsp;of the game. The only difference is there is an added scenario you can play through. The storytelling is very dark and disturbing. The graphics shift from dark and weird, to demonic and disgusting. The sound in the game is amazing. The problem with the game lies in the repetitive gameplay. I love this game, but I will admit that it has an extreme flaw.

Graphics- 9.5/10
The graphics don't exactly look realistic, but they are done in a cinematic way that will leave you breathless. The cut scenes are often short, but run seamlessly into the normal gameplay graphics. The picture often has a fuzzy, dark look to it that reminds me of an old horror movie. The cut scenes are done amazingly and you will find yourself immersed in the world they have created.

Environments are designed well, and will even change as you go through the gameplay. One time you might be walking through a spooky hallway, but after a major point in the story that same hallway has blood all over it. There is a considerable amount of fog in the game, but it is not to hide graphical failures. You know this because later in the game the fog is gone and replaced by darkness.

The dark in this game is creatively done too. If it is too dark, your character won't be able to investigate items or his map. You get a flashlight early in the game, but there are points where you will just not be able to use it and will have to figure out what to do. At the same time though, your flashlight alerts enemies of your presence.

The enemies in the game, despite not having many of them, look great. Some stand like mannequins and only move when you get close enough. Others with stumble around until you take them down, then they will crawl across the floor. There are only about 6-7 different enemy types in the game though.

Story- 9/10
You are James Saunderland. You have been a broken man since the tragic death of your wife, Mary, three years ago. One day you receive a letter from your thought dead wife. She asks him to meet her in Silent Hill at their ""special place."" James is unsure of what is going on, but he has to check it out.

Along your trek through Silent Hill, you will meet many troubled people. Speaking to them will bring chills down your spine. Important characters you meet will be Laura, an 8-year old girl, and Maria, a striking Mary look-alike. These characters all evolve over the course of the story.

The story is excellent. It does have a few problems though. One, the story is very complex and you really have to think about it if you want to understand it. You might even have to talk to a few other players to even understand it. The story is left open like that. Another problem is that the monsters that you face off with throughout the game seem to be an after thought. They are not truly explained until the very end of the game. I felt that it was too late by then.

Sound- 9.5/10
The sound in this game is almost perfect. Early in the game you get a radio. The radio only plays static, and only when an enemy is close. This is a good way to create suspense. Sometimes the radio will actually play words they you should pay attention to.

The voice acting is mostly good. I felt that James felt too calm, but everyone else I liked. The monsters all sound disturbing. Gun and melee weapon noises are decent. Sometimes the addition of random disturbing sounds really creates a great atmosphere in this game. Great sound overall.

Gameplay- 7/10
You start on the outskirts of Silent Hill. All you have is a map, the letter, and a photo of Mary. You make your way into town to try to figure out if Mary is there. You discover a town full of monsters and closed to the public in almost everyway. Mary keeps sending you clues, and you follow them like a dog...because usually every other way is closed off. The game is like a mystery adventure game with some monsters along the way.

This game plays out very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B0000657SP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>. I have always liked Resident Evil, so I thought this would be a good thing. It is not though. The monsters in this game are lacking, and never really pose much of a threat. They are disturbing, but you can just walk right past them. In Resident Evil, a zombie or a hunter always had a chance to injure you. In this game there is almost not chance you will get hurt by the monsters. When they do hit you, it lacks the suspense. The monsters are just not a big enough deal for you to care about them.

The rest of the gameplay has you following Mary's clues. They lead you to Apartments, Museums, and Hospitals. The concept involves you entering a building and trying every door until you find one that works. Most of the doors are broken and you'll never get in them. Every single building, it is the same thing. Once you find a key or something, you go back and unlock a door. However, this never gets tedious. I enjoyed exploring the various building and find out the secrets of Silent Hill.

This game implements melee and gun combat. Both are horribly done. All melee weapons in this game are imprecise and often get you hurt before you can hit an enemy. The auto-aim feature in this game is horrible. You often think you have aimed, but instead you will hit the wall or something. There are very few weapons even in this game to start with, and none of them excite you to wield them.

Difficulty- 6/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)
Difficulty is very well done in this game. You can adjust puzzle difficulty and monster difficulty separately. This allows for you to adjust the two key features of this game for your playing style. This is very innovative in a video game, as games usually just have a couple difficulty settings that change everything. This game allows you to customize different aspects of the gameplay.

Why did I give this category such a low score then? No matter what difficulty you put this game on the monsters will be too easy. They serve almost no purpose, so it's not fun killing them. Also, the exploration in the game is based on luck. You stumble onto things that help you. In the beginning, you aren't even told where to go. You just have to search the huge town until you find something. There are not a lot of suggestions as to where you need to go.

Overall- 7.5/10
I like this game a lot. I really do. I just can't give it that great of a score considering the weak gameplay and luck-based exploration. Sound, graphics, and the story are great, but not enough to pull this one up more. I still suggest buying this one if you are looking to enter a very disturbing world, but don't expect the best gameplay.","Fun Exploration, Weak Combat",1218844800,7,,

You run a restaurant and make food to keep up with customer orders, simulating chopping, stirring, and cutting with the stylus. Some of the things you can make are sushi, spaghetti, steak, hamburger, curry rice. They all involve a different gesture with the pen and you must get the customer happy meter full before time runs out. As the levels progress, more and more customers will come in, requiring you to multitask quickly. The waitress will also occasionally bother you for help. It's in your best interest to help her since her graphic takes up almost the entire screen so you can't see the customers. Her tasks are things like wiping the table, punching numbers into a calculator, sorting plates, cups, and silverware into the right bins, or guiding a delivery bike to a customer.

The game is very short -- only 15 levels. I got to level 11 on normal difficulty after less than an hour. In Free Mode, you can replay any of the levels you've beaten in Story Mode. Every level is basically the same, with just different graphics and more and more people thrown at you at once. There are 10 mini-games to unlock. They're all one-shot games/distractions in the vein of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WarioWare/dp/B000VLJQ76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WarioWare</a>&nbsp;brand. They're not related to the restaurant theme and seem just randomly tacked on. They have really generic names and don't even star the characters in the main game. For example, ""Super hot food"" is a shell game of curry plates. They spin around and you have to find the one that doesn't have hot sauce. Another is ""Finding Ingredients"". You get 3 tries to find truffles randomly hidden on the screen by placing a pig on the screen. The pig points to the direction the truffle is in. After 3 wrong, the location resets. Then there's ""Sauce Decoration"". You trace over lines on a cake. Most of the mini-games are timed and aren't a whole lot of fun. There's really no point to them, as they don't unlock any extras. No character galleries, customizable restaurant, cookbook. Zilch.

Overall, this game is not very fulfilling and there's not a whole lot here to recommend. If you just want something mindless to waste time with, I suppose this is ok, but there are better puzzle games available.

You can't have three people playing guitar, bass, and keyboards at the same time. UNLESS you go into a different mode which disables scoring as a vocalist. This means,you can still have a singer, or singers, but they can't fail or score. Also, you can't go on Xbox live in this mode. Even if you have ONLY three people playing, if they're playing those three instruments (b/g/k),  it will still go into this mode. Or you can opt to NOT go into the special mode and be without one of those three instruments.

So, yeah, you can have 7 people play (bass, guitar, keyboards,drum, lead vocals, 2 harmonizing vocals), but the singers aren't really doing anything. There's lots of info about this design flaw, as well as glitches, around the web.

Otherwise, the song selection is great. I had Rock Band 1, so it automatically imported those songs, as well as my DLC (you gotta pay tenbucks to download all but 5 of the RB2 songs. I haven't done this yet.).

It's easier to drop out, if you want to take a break, without forcing the band to back all the way out. And, of course, playing the keyboard is a complete blast, esp in pro mode.

The fact that I find reading sheet music easier than playing pro keys kind of bothers me. I don't know if it's just that the learning style is different, if the keyboard should be bigger, or what, but that whole element falls flat on me. One thing I wish is that when you hit a sour note on the keyboard, if you got aural cues telling you where you went wrong, as opposed to a generic click. That's sort of a good frame of reference for really playing the piano. (however I will say the piano tutorials actually delve into music theory so a+ there)

It's like HMX had a totally awesome thing going leading up to Beatles Rock Band (which I still think knocked it out of the park) and then squandered it with Green Day Rock Band (seriously?) and then Rock Band 3 which is essentially a really awesome extra long track back with some baffling changes.

The menus are annoying to navigate, you now collect spades as well as stars (I have no idea why) and if you want to get into the pro realm of things you're looking to spend another couple hundred dollars.

I feel sort of like, for whatever reason, Rock Band is trying to recapture the more annoying elements of Guitar Hero, with the game telling you when you've got certain length streaks going on, throwing challenges at you, and having sound effects that detract from the music.

It plays as a 3rd party fighting/action RPG game, in the same way, although visually it might appear and feel more like Darksiders.

The plot sees you as some kind of reformed criminal in a fantasy/gothic/mythical world of monsters and magic, as you try and solve a mystery/defeat the evil powers, etc. Play sees you choose weapons and armour, as you hack and blast your way through enemies and levels, until you red each boss.

Sadly in comparison to Dark Souls the game falls short. Gameplay, especially movement and combat feel lumpy and slow. The targetting mechanic is unreliable and the hits you land often seem out of time with your expectations - which is important when the combat is challenging because you need to be able to trust your timing! The look of the game is also a bit lacking. Character models are ok, but the scenery and locations look muddy and lacking in detail.

Some of the crafting is confusing and a lot of times you don't know what use something has, but otherwise, it's all very good gaming done right. But the storyline writers obviously wanted a female character so obnoxious in her condescension of everyone else, made to be arrogant, and the recipient of groveling and praise from kings and everyone else as to be a cartoonish joke. ""Ohmigosh you are so capable and formidable!"" says everyone in the game to her.  Textbook Mary Sue. Males in the game are like 99% grovelers, buffoons, or just evil.

The variety of robot monsters is well done, though. And it's good at letting the user opt for more stealth or action. And it's good for giving the user the option to kill in a variety of ways, and different monsters have different weaknesses, so there's some intelligence involved which is good. The open world and scale of different monsters is also fairly epic. And again I have to stress how good the gameplay is. There are plenty of side missions too.

3.0,False,"12 1, 2008",A29U7FIV2KY3AM,B000FRVAD4,Rob H,"IMO: When a sequel is launched, there are a few important criteria that must be met for it to be successful.

1. Does the gameplay improve?
2. Does the story continue into new and interesting territory?
3. Do the graphics improve?
4. Are the throwbacks from the first game improved by a large amount?
5. Do I feel continuity from the old game and a desire to replay it?

My answers to these questions:
1. Slightly... fable 1 had a very odd interface about casting ""Will"" spells and it required a high degree of human dexterity to successfully quickly cast spells intermingled with other attacks.  Fable2 solves some of these problems by allowing users to bind a spell to the ""B"" button so that you don't need to hit the right trigger at the same time to cast, however, they introduced casting time for higher level spells so holding B becomes an annoyance.

2. Fable2's story is actually pretty funny.  They start by pointing out that the ""old heroes"" (from fable1) became arrogant and ran amuck.  Much like I did after beating fable1 and getting bored with no quests to completed... so this is funny... but outside that one joke, pretty much all previous story lines are erased (not that fable1 had much of a story).

3. Yes, xbox360 graphics for Fable2 are very pretty and I've actually caught myself enjoying a sunrise / sunset or two.  Character / weapon graphics are good and the ""finishing"" moves are fun.  However the fights (while graphically are fun) are pretty generic and bland, with only two types: you vs. boss, you vs. hoardes.  I would have liked to be required to outsmart someone, or do something more interesting than just mush X until the people die.

4. Fable 2 could easily be Fable 1.  The existing things are there, and the new additions?  Well there aren't many...  Your dog is kinda fun, but you can only do a few things with him.  Jobs are a good easy way to get gold, but are completely monotonous (like real life i guess), dying your clothes colors... whee... for 5 minutes... The weapons / behavior quests are all pretty darn similar / same... There just wasn't anything drastically new / exciting.  I enjoy playing, but there's no real wow factor bringing me back.

5. As I wrote earlier, one of the first things they tell you in Fable2 is that the Fable 1 world is not around anymore.  So.. uh.. no. and I have pretty much no interest in playing fable 1 cuz it's pretty much the same :(

All in all, as a stand-alone new game... it's ok, nothing special and nothing that's terribly memorable since all the cool things you can do in fable 2 (like git-busy) were there in fable 1... meh... but as a sequel it's bad... it's not halo-2 pick up a second gun... it's halo-3... not much new, not enough exciting changes to live up to it's own reputation.",Fable 2 or Fable 1?,1228089600,4,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

First off, it's a better ranged weapon/ability game versus the first (e.g. rogues with bows). The warrior class is sluggish and the dual weapon rogue is pretty useless versus bosses. It's also pretty lame running up to a rival and just keep smashing a button over and over until they're dead. Mages and archers have a very good advantage compared to the others.

There is a big disappointment in the story lineage. It's kind of like taking DA:Origins and cutting the storyline in a third and just extending the secondary quests. Also, one of the biggest reasons I loved DA:Origins, is you could literally spend an hour or two just talking to your companions either upsetting them or flattering them. Not so in this game.

True, you are able to import saved characters from Origins to introduce different aspects, but the game really only has brief cameo appearances from the original companions (excluding Anders). Speaking of which, Anders has become a whiner in this game as well as all other male companions. So, literally, the ""fun"" has been taken out.

3.0,True,"03 14, 2016",ANW6EGY12V5XS,B00KVKOF9Q,Henri Savin,"So far, so good... One should not expect too much from this game. It is not a simulation game, the story is pretty cliche but it is better than its critics said it was. One big point of contention, I hate these remainders to buy the game expansion every time the game starts. I also hate reaching a mission point to realize I have to buy it to play it. They should simply make it invisible to me.
So here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
- Very large map that you can roam as much as you wish.
- Open world, the game is not too scripted.
- Nice graphics
- Fairly nice interface
- A few months after release the price I paid is very reasonable.
- Good rain, day and night simulations.
- Force feedback is nice when it works

Cons:
- Constant reminders to buy the expansion
- Driving wheel is somehow bugged. I have to reset it a few times per game as I sometimes lose the force feedback and some other times the steering wheel gets block to the left or to the right.
- Some weird games behaviors. For instance, if another player is being chased by the police, you can ram the police cars, barrages and they are not going to run after you. You can also pass a police car at full speed and it won't chase you... Not really like the reality.
- Even in story mode, you have to be connected to the internet to play. I know that more and more people do have internet but I do not like the constraints.
- Damage management is pretty counter intuitive. Sometimes my car appears to fix itself, some other times not. Also the damages are frankly not realistic. I start at a health level of 90 and after much damage taken I may be down to 80... It is not really clear to me.
- No mods is apparently allowed at this stage
- No control for the lights?
- Visible port from Console to PC

In the end, I will keep on playing it until I will get bored. I am not sure I will want to go to the end of the game as the missions are a bit too cliche as I said before.

The game was fun but once I beat it I had felt like I basically did the same things over and over again. It's a giant great world but nothing really stood out as memorable. I look back on it now and it feels like the entire world was just little variations of the same thing.

For probably the 3rd time not including NG+. In my opinion this is in fact a GOOD GAME but its NOT quite as FANTASTIC as the OTHER INSTALLATIONS of the series. The combat felt a little more whacky and less smooth compared to the other ones where a lot of times Batman would accidentally ruin a combo by punching in the wrong direction etc. The shock gloves are also an iffy feature as they simplify combat so much that all the other character types such as the armored thugs don't require the stun. Basically they serve as an easy tool. I also thought (I could be wrong) but it felt to me like there were far less predator rooms. This especially annoyed due to the fact that the challenges to be completed regarding predator takedowns essentially have to be started at a very early stage should you wish to complete them, for example I didn't find many predator rooms that you could revisit after campaign in order to fulfill the challenges.
STORY (Contains SOME SPOILERS)
Overall the story was pretty good, however I wouldnt say it held up to the quality that was created by other games of the series. SPOILER: I was actually looking forward to seeing a different antagonist take roll as the main lead rather than the typical joker story, so ultimately while I did enjoy the fact that joker is lead in this game, I was disappointed as I was looking forward to have a new character breath some freshness into the villain aspect.

Also I disliked the city as Arkham City for example was FULL AND FILLED with life and much to do within the small scale of the map, whereas Origins is a LARGE map with LITTLE LIFE to it.

Oh lastly I didn't like the name of the game as I really was expecting more of an origin to the batman then I received. Youre already batman its just at this point the police aren't friendly yet and some people think you're mythical, other than that and the meeting of the joker not much of the origin of batman is established.

OH and also very little innovation took place within this game. There is little new stuff that is changed to the core of the game. Pretty much just a new gadget and shock gloves...

3.0,False,"04 11, 2009",A3SSF70KY5AJSM,B000N4MSAS,NoFear_2008,"First of all, this is NOT a run-and-gun FPS. Actually, it's a TPS (Third-person-shooter). Anyway, this requires a more slow and methodical play style than your Halo or Resistance type of shooter.

On-line play is OK, but the poor controls really kill the fun.

The Good:
- Very good cut-scenes. Helps move the story along. And there IS a story, which some may not care about. For me, it kept things more interesting. And despite what someone claimed earlier, you CAN skip the cut-scenes.
- Things to do other than just killing Nazis. You've got ""Recon Sites"" you can visit, which unlock some historical facts about Operation Market Garden. You also have ""Kilroys"" to find.
- Squad mechanics is done fairly well. It has its problems, but nothing major.
- Makes you think about the battlefield and how to use cover/flanking/etc.

The Bad
- Third Person Shooter. Some people like that, some don't care. I generally don't like TPS, because you always end up at some point not being able to look in the direction you want to look. It's just a problem with TPS in general (the worst was an older Metal Gear game I played on Xbox... the only game I've ever returned).
- Poor choice of controls. Why does each game designer insist on using different control layouts than everyone else? Half the games I've played use R1 for primary fire, while the other half use R2. WHY???
- No ability to customize controls (related to above). Come on now! This is a sore point for me. It seems fewer and fewer games allow any type of customization of the controls, yet each one has its own idea of which button should do what. Why do I have to re-learn which trigger is primary fire each time I play a different game??? VERY BAD!!!
- In Realistic difficulty, you don't have any cross-hairs. OK, sounds ""realistic"", except if you're dug in behind cover and pop out to shoot, since this is a TPS, you can't see where you're aiming!!! Did anyone actually play-test this thing???
- Can't pick up grenades from bodies.
- No jumping.
- No crawling or prone position.
- No melee. All the pics show you have this nasty combat knife, but you can't actually use it???
- Poor AI. Your squads don't use very good judgement about using cover to get to where you want them. You sometimes have to micro-manage their route, or they'll run in front of some cover and get killed.
- In Realistic mode, you have no idea how many magazines you're carrying. I understand you may not know how many bullets are left in a magazine, but surely you know if you only have one left vs 10 left.
- No consistency about what objects you can vault over and which you can't.
- Related to above, when running, bumping into the smallest of obstacles brings you to a complete halt. I've gotten killed numerous times when I was trying to run to cover but nicked the corner of some piece of wood or something, coming to a complete halt. You also can't really turn very well while running.
- There's more, but I don't want to seem like I'm bashing the game.

I loved the first Smackdown games, and figured the next generation on PS2 HAD to be fabulous...but now that I've had the game and played it for awhile, I can see where they were coming from.
First off, the game is graphically beautiful...the only exception perhaps being the 2-D crowd, which looks pretty silly when your character goes into the crowd to fight.  Entrances are true to what you see on TV, and the music & videos on the TitanTron are fabulous.  The create-a-wrestler mode is big, with tons of options, even some you need to unlock.  There are dozens of game modes including Royal Rumble, which can now handle around 8 in the ring at the same time, and Hell in a Cell with tag-teams, fatal 4-ways and even a 6-pack type match...it rocks to climb to the top of the ring and fight or jump off, and pancaking Tazz through the top of the cage was awesome!!!  The many other modes are great, and will provide variety in gameplay.
The Story mode is the 'main' part of the game...you pick a character and guide them through to the title.  Trouble is, the title is usually only 2-3 matches away...too short.  A career/season mode would do better.  You can walk around the arena at certain times, but this is generally pretty pointless as you usually are just looking for a tag team partner, and once you find one, nobody else is around the building, giving you nothing interesting to do.
Controls are not that great, as trying to find a specific opponent can be rough.  You can attack your partner or the ref, and you will frequently do this accidentally during a match because you can't quite tell who you just scrolled to.  In matches where you have multiple opponents, this can cost you the match as you could get squashed by your true opponent while trying to find another.  Personally, I often find myself launching a simple kick or punch when I think I'm close enough, then wind up missing altogether and getting nailed...perhaps it's a perception problem on my part, but this adds to the frustration factor.
Commentating from Tazz & Michael Cole is ok...repetitive and pointless often, ""(Fill-in-the-wrestler's name)...is different from other superstars"" and other pieced-together phrases don't make much sense, but I learned to ignore the commentators after awhile (ps - Tazz does commentary for his own matches).
Overall, this game entertained me, but won't have the shelf life it could/should have.

3.0,False,"02 26, 2012",A1YVM25R9R9ENG,B000AX224Y,Joel McGee,"First off a short history lesson on the Game Boy Micro:

The DS was originaly not designed to be the successor to the Game Boy Advance, but rather a ""third pillar"" going along with the Gamecube. The idea was that the DS would be a higer end device with it's unique features while the GBA would be for a more budget minded gamer; at least that was the plan back in 2004.

The Micro was designed in 2005 to take advantages of the strenghts of the platform (affordability, conservative hardware) marketed towards those who want to game on the go but don't want a bulky system like the DS or PSP. In that respect the Micro made a lot of sense and it accomplished it's goals, but a lot was lost in the process.

The Micro (in case you haven't guessed) is the smallest system Nintendo has ever made, and the last to bear the name Game Boy. In your hand it feels very small, about the same size as a NES controller or basic cell phone. You can easily hold in and wrap your hands around the unit without much effort. The size is by far the most compelling feature of the system.

The button layout is similar to that of the NES controller with A and B on the front to the right of the screen, the D-Pad (which nearly identical to the DS lite's) is on the left, and the start and select buttons beneath the screen almost at the bottom of the unit. L and R are on top and are suprisingly large and feel great. The layout is a bit crampt (as to be expected) but works well enough. In terms of comfort, the face buttons better than the original GBA, and the shoulder buttons more comforable than the SP's, but basically it falls in between the two.

The screen I think is somewhere in between too. It's much better than the orginal GBA's, it has a very nice even backlight, and is sharp and clear, besting even the SP for lighing and clarity. However, I can't help but to be put off by the small size, and it still falls short of what the SP lite offers.

Sound quality leaves a lot to be desired, even compared to previous version. It's tinny, weak, and of course mono. It does work mind you, but put on even a decent pair of earbuds and you will immediatley notice a huge difference. The restored headphone jack is very nice, a bit ackwardly placed (bottom right of the unit) but I'd rather have it that way than not at all like the SP. The sound and backlight can be adjusted by the volume buttons on the side, similarly designed to the XL,(just hold the L button while adjusting for the backlight) I really love the way it's set up and think that it's not only functional but intuitive.

So how do I like it? I think it's cool to have such a small, super portable GBA with such an amazing screen. It fits so well in my pocket, and feels like its very durable. It's reliable and not only that it's customizable with faceplates. (They can be found on Amazon for about $5) I can carry it around for a quick round of Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Mario Kart. With all that said, I find it hard to reccomend to anyone who isn't a collector or enthusiast, heres why:

1 Unlike all other models of the GBA, it won't play original Game Boy or Game Boy color cartidges. If that is a compelling feature for you, you can mark the Micro off your list.

2 They are hard to find. The Micro did not sell well, and was considered a commercial failure. So finding a Micro will be more difficult to come by than the original GBA or SP.

3 They are expensive when you do find them. I say expensive relatively speaking. Depending on condition they range from $65 to $100. The DS can be found for about that price and the SP for about half that price.

4 They are less functional. The Micro can connect to other systems (other GBA's and the GCN) but requires and $8 adapter in addition to the link cables needed. And if you're going the DS route, you're getting the next gen system with a lot more functionality only lacking the connectivity.

In a nutshell you are paying a high price for portablity. For the money the better bets are the SP, or the DS. Either one gets you more bang for the buck. But if you are like me, who already have said systems, there is something inherantly cool about owning a Micro.

- wall running is cool (even though probably influenced from the Matrix).

- good to have a middle-eastern themed title in the mix.

- graphics are fine.

NEUTRAL

- story

CONS

- combat is button mashing, arcade-like, not much fun for many of us.

- primary combat attack is a button, not the right trigger (like every single other game in existence). Counter-intuitive.

- camera (view) is DEPLORABLE. Often uncontrollable and goes wherever the hell it wants to.

- bad guy is a rip-off of Aladdin's bad guy, even with a long face, beard and cobra-headed staff...only thing missing is Gilbert Gottfried's annoying parrot.

- too much like Tomb Raider. Gameplay, climbing, jumping, locations, etc. Combat in tomb raider is also fairly bad with its goofy infinite ammo auto-targeting stuff.

- time control is just a gimmick in place of a much better function (SAVE ANYWHERE).

- jumping around is often risky and hard to control (just like in Tomb Raider). Often it jumps where you don't want to, often to your death.

However, if you want to customize it, then you'll need to install the software - which makes perfect sense.

The control feels a little cheap (quality is ok at best), but can't expect much for around ~$25.

The current PS3 controller is on sale around 40 dollars any day, and the difference in quality is fairly large. Plus the PS3 offer rumble, wireless, great battery life, etc. So the regular PS3 controller provides a better value in my opinion. However, it is closer in quality to an xbox controller - and works similarly.

But this controller does a decent job:

- Games that support the xbox controller (Think microsoft) support the controller - i.e. XInput compatible, broad game support
-  D-pad is good quality

Any movement that required delicate aiming and precision, started to show the downsides of the controller. It's just not that great, or has some dead zones where it just doesn't register very well. Which kills the experience of the controller.
I do personally prefer the mouse for those kinds of games, so your mileage may vary here.

Overall if you're going to use the controller to play combat games (the batman series, maybe racing) and not say Doom, CounterStrike (FPS) games, then you will probably be happy with this controller. If you play mostly games requiring precision, you'll be better off with a different controller or simply stick with the mouse.","plug and play, ok quality",1350518400,,,

As other reviews have noted, this is NOT a flight sim. There are weapons and missions in this game that don't happen in real life. But if you don't approach it looking for a complete 100% realistic experience, it's a lot of fun. Although, having said that, the realism is pretty close. It does give you a sense of what it's like to fly between buildings in a major metropolitan city at high speeds as well as dodge missiles coming at you from all angles.

The storyline of this game was supposed to follow the storyline of the most recent Tom Clancy game, Endwar. But it appears the developers decided to go a different direction. Gamers who have played previous Tom Clancy games will recognize CPT Mitchell from Ghost Recon leading a team of ground troops in the game. That little addition I really liked. I wanted to really make sure I helped out the Ghosts during each ground mission they were in because I'd previously played the Ghost Recon games.

Now, the bad, and the reason I rated this game only three stars. Ubisoft did not do a good job with the quality control on this at all. I experienced NUMEROUS freezing problems with this game, and they've been reported by a lot of gamers. It usually freezes on the title screen right when you press start to get into the game. I've also had it freeze on me during a mission briefing. Secondly, sometimes the audio during a mission briefing doesn't match the text, and I've also seen grammatical mistakes in the briefings, as well as minor things like spelling ""defense"" as ""defence"". To an American audience that's noticeable and the grammatical mistake I found is inexcusable. There are also game play issues that cause problems. In a heavy dogfight sometimes you will find your ""fire"" button unresponsive for 5-10 seconds after launching a missile. This would be no big deal and could be chalked up to an attempt at realism, but it's not consistent. Sometimes it'll happen and sometimes it doesn't.

On balance this game is a lot of fun but it could have been a truly amazing, great game had Ubisoft put some more polish on it. The graphics are good but don't live up to the jaw dropping graphics from early game play videos released after the game was originally announced.

It worked pretty fine when I first got it, and then one day it started either responding when I wasn't hitting a certain up arrow, or it wouldn't go in when I hit it. It gets really frustrating when you're trying to get at least A's on all your songs, and the pad has to glitch out occasionally (it's completely random when it glitches and when it acts fine, maybe it's something in the pad itself, or I don't know), and you keep ""missing"" the arrows, giving you a B or lower. I only use this pad for about a half hour when I play.

Another thing that frustrates me is when you're playing DDR or Stepmania or whatever purpose you're using the pad for, is when you continuously move around and the pad has to consistently move around and about, and you won't even notice it half the time until you start missing notes and realizing you're hitting the wrong arrows/buttons because the pad's moving all around! I haven't had this happen to me on any other kind of pad I used, so I was quite shocked this one did it.

All in all, if you can put up with occasional (but seemingly rare) glitching, and if you can somehow secure the pad so you can dance without it slipping about, get this.

Sadly after finishing the game my conclusion is that Brutal Legend is more hype than substance and more filler than unforgettable experience.

There is undoubtedly some fun to be had in this game. Brutal Legend is and odd mixture of open-world exploration coupled with Real Time Strategy elements known as ""stage battles"". The voice work headed by Jack Black is top-notch. As is the heavy metal soundtrack. I'm a bit torn whether to categorize the graphics as merely passable or the stuff of last-generation. For sure the graphics are nothing revolutionary. Though the art-style itself is great and the world of Brutal Legend is imaginative.

Unfortunately the curious choices by Schafer & company to make Brutal Legend an open-world game ultimately harm the game more than adding to it. So much of this title is filler. Pointless side-quests that have you driving all over the world map to do a certain chore. The main storyline itself can probably be completed in 4-5 hours so I suspect the side-quests are mainly included to pad the game a bit.

Another curious element are the stage battles. These are RTS battles where you must build up and army of various units to attack an opposing army. The goal is to ultimately destroy the other army's stage itself. To say that these battles are out of place is an understatement. RTS games have never really found a comfortable home on consoles for a reason - mainly the control interface. Brutal Legend's RTS battles are no exception. The battles are awkward thanks to clumsy controls and a sluggish camera. The disjointed and unbalanced armies add to the frustration. Unfortunately there are several of these battles scattered around the storyline.

I was really hoping for a story driven, stylized game in Brutal Legend - the types of games Tim Schafer is known for. Unfortunately what I got was a game that would be more suitable in 2004 than in 2009.

Pros:
-The character designs are decent, and all of the characters have good personalities.
-The game is set in our world, circa 19th century but with magic.
-The skill trees allow you to upgrade special commands for each character.
-The automap that appears on the bottom screen is very helpful for town navigation.
-There is a save/full heal point before every boss.
-A character's HP and MP are fully restored upon levelling up.
-Effectively, you are free to spam your abilities in dungeons.

Cons:
-You can't use the touch screen as an interface in battles or to move your characters throughout the world.
-Levelling up system
  I hate the levelling up in this game.  Firstly, there are, as far as I know no passive skills.  Secondly, this game uses a system where every time you win a battle, you obtain skill points which you use to advance your tech trees.  The problem lies in the fact that the entire party shares the same supply of skill points.  In other words, you are frequently forced to choose which character's skills you want to improve.  And once the black mage joins your party, this gets ridiculous because she learns an ability or two every time she levels up and you have to spend 100 skill points just so that she can use the command.  Maybe you're supposed to unlock these abilities later when your enemies start dropping more skill points, but I don't know.
-Random Encounters
  I don't have a problem with the random encounter rate in this game, per se.  My problem is that battles take forever, even once you've learned that you are free to spam your abilites with the melee characters.  If you try going all out on your enemies and concentrate all of your fire power on the same enemy, they go down quickly.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work because the mage will burn through her MPs way too quickly.  So combat becomes unnecesarilly annoying in this game.
-The zepellin is useless
  And by useless, I mean that you aren't immune to random encounters.  I should point out that not all RPGs use this mechanic, which is a bit of a cliche.  For example, in Final Fantasy III (NDS), you can still be attacked in your airship.  However, the random encounter rate is FAR lower than when walking on the ground.  Now, in Nostalgia, it feels like I am fighting more random encounter battles that I faced in the dungeons filled with monsters.  Unfortunately, the only way to go between two towns is to use the zepellin, making getting between two towns a chore.  And the same problem with the basic enemies being able to take too many hits for the battles to end quickly apply here as well.","Mixed feelings, annoying random encounters",1310774400,2,,
3.0,False,"04 22, 2012",A3HORVSI2I23YR,B005FYJA52,Dasbooby,"Mario shooting around galaxies sounds like a fun and interesting idea until you start playing.

  The good - The game is pretty long, I'd say expect around 25 hours + to get all 120 stars (There's actually a 121st I think, but this involves re-beating the whole game with Luigi which would have just been a chore).  There are some interesting ideas here and when the game works alright it can be somewhat fun.

  The camera in this game is atrocious.  On smaller planets you can't control it at all and it just follows you around which keeps any enemies or traps hidden from your view until you run into them.  It also does a bad job at giving you a decent idea of where you are in relation to enemies/objects.  Often times you'll jump up to hit that goomba that looks like he's 1 foot in front of you but while you're in mid-air the camera moves to show he's actually 3-4 feet away from you.  You end up landing right in front of him and getting hit.  This isn't a huge deal as you'll almost never die from actual enemies but it is annoying.  Later on, you'll gain the ability to fly.  The camera and depth perception it offers for this are just awful.  It took me a while to finish the 100 purple coin mission as I kept flying over or under the coins because I couldn't tell where they were in relation to me.

  The worst part is when you're on some of the bigger planets.  You'll be in an area that is completely wide open, nothing that could possibly impede the camera, and try to change the camera angle and the game will refuse to let you.  WHY???  Who decided it was a good idea that I shouldn't be able to change camera angles in wide open areas.  Now you're forced to play with whatever angle they want to give you which is often terrible.  I can't count the number of times that some death pit is covered up because of the way the camera is angled so you end up running right into it.  This forces you to move Mario around at slow speeds so you don't accidentally fall into a pit the camera hasn't moved itself to reveal yet.  There are some places where you will play upside down.  Why they couldn't turn the camera to place you right side up, I don't know, but they don't.  This makes it harder for you to judge depths and control yourself.  This is especially awful in some parts where the camera turns while you're upside down so now you have to stop and think about which direction to press the stick in order to get Mario to go where you actually want him to go.  You will also jump to your death a lot because the game wouldn't let you center the camera behind Mario so now you're making an awkward diagonal jump.  I just can't believe that a Mario game could have camera controls this bad when Mario 64 and Sunshine did it pretty much perfectly.

  Controls - I don't know how they screwed this up but they did.  Mario controls pretty terribly.  A lot of this has to do with the way the camera functions.  If you want to go left to right really quick, sometimes Mario will stop on a dime, flip around and move on.  Other times, he'll run in a circle for no reason which causes you to have to adjust for this which messes you up again which causes you to have to readjust again.  Sometimes he'll take another step or two forward before he flips around to go the other way.  This can get really annoying if you were planning on making a quick jump but now Mario is running the opposite way you're pressing or in a circle so you end up jumping to your death.  This happens at the worst possible times and about halfway through the game I got really paranoid about making quick jumps as I was worried he was going to do something stupid to cause me to die.  On icy planets, Mario can skate around if you shake the controller.  They don't bother explaining to you though that there is no button to get him to stop skating.  You have to figure out to jump and do a ground pound.  I ended up skating to my death 2 times before I figured this out.  Sometimes you'll shake the remote to swing at an enemy or object on an icy planet and after hitting the enemy/object, Mario will start skating.  Because you weren't ready for this though, you end up skating to your death.  I won't even go into how terribly Mario controls after getting the spring power up.

  Story - Peach gets captured again and you go to rescue her in space.  I know this is the way it's always been and Peach is just a gimmick for an excuse for Mario to go on an adventure but it's starting to get old.  I'm not asking for RPG excellence here but a little more fleshed out story would be nice.

  Challenge - This game is ridiculously easy.  You will probably never die because there was an enemy that was difficult.  The bosses are mostly a complete joke and those that do actually manage to give you some trouble will mostly be a result of the terrible camera.  I'm not saying you won't die a lot in this game, because you will.  The thing is, 98-99% of those deaths will be a result of the terrible camera or controls and not something that was actually your fault.  I don't mind dying if it's my fault but I can't stand dying when there was no way for me to prevent it.  If you're looking for a game where you die and have to learn from it to get better, then look elsewhere.  The game is pretty forgiving though on deaths as you'll likely never run out of lives and you normally start close by to where you died.  The times it is really annoying though is during the purple coin missions.  Did you spend 5-10 minutes collecting 60/100 of them and then die because of a terrible camera angle or controls?  Well, hope you enjoy spending another 5-10 minutes collecting those same purple coins over again.

  Power ups - There's the star, fireflower and mushroom, all standard.  Introduced are the abilities for Mario to turn into a bee, boo, spring, ice man, and maybe another one or two I'm forgetting.  The problem I have with all this though is that they're all very limited.  You will very rarely ever use any of these powers.  The fireflower for some reason is set to about a 15-20 second time and you'll only ever use it to light some torches to open a door or melt some snowmen.  Why can't I run around and use it on enemies until I get hit.  Also very annoying is that instead of pushing a button to shoot fireballs so you can shoot and keep moving, you have to shake the controller which causes Mario to stop moving.  The ice man power works kind of the same way.  It gives you the ability to walk on water but it only lasts for about 20 seconds before it wears off.  You'll use it to hop on some water spouts on a couple boards but never put it to good effect otherwise.  The bee, boo and spring (Which is infinitely awful) powers last as long as you want or until you touch something that gets rid of it.  Most of the time you don't use them for more then a minute or so before you decide to get out of them.  The bee suit will be the one most often used but most of the time it will be given on boards where you are doing tedious collection tasks.

  Star bits/Coins/item boxes etc.. - You get a 1Up for every 50 star bits you get on a level which can be a lot as you'll sometimes end up with 150-250 by the end of a board.  You can shoot these at some enemies to stun them or occasionally some random plant/spot to get a coin.  I've noticed though that the aiming star they give you for this is not entirely accurate.  Sometimes they'll go off to the side or some other such nonsense.  Occasionally you'll shoot 10-15 of these things at a cannon ball to destroy it and somehow they'll all end up missing and you'll get hit anyway.  I could understand missing with a bunch, but I feel like at least one of them should take out the cannon ball.  This will happen more than just once or twice and can be annoying. You get a 1Up for every 50 coins you get as well.  Problem is that a lot of boards don't even bother having 50 coins so there's really no use to getting these other then they give you health back if you're injured.  Most item boxes either contain star bits, coins, or something not very useful.  There is almost no reason to even bother going for any of these.  There are 1Ups hidden around some boards but you'll get so many lives playing the game that you never even need to bother going for these.

  Main hub - There's a main hub area where you go to different rooms of the hub to get to the boards.  It's alright at first but later on it gets a little annoying as you have to take stupid or annoying pathways to get to them.  Then on some of the upper floors, if you accidentally fall off, you have to walk all the way back up.  I don't know why they couldn't have just made this all easier and more convenient.

  Overall, I'd rate the game a 6/10, -2 for the camera, -1 for no challenge and -1 for the power up, controls fiasco.  My biggest concern for this game though is the almost complete lack of fun.  The game feels like a chore to get through most of the time and I only finished it because I'd started it.  I don't understand all the hype or praise it was given.  It never really cleverly or uniquely innovates in any fun or interesting way.

3.0,True,"05 9, 2016",A1VC7DQHCGRD4E,B00KVL0SIM,Kyle Kyle Kyle,"First, a quick rating in 1-5 stars *

Lots of praise to this game despite some very bitter remarks in this review. I still play this game despite how stoooopid this game can be but as a genuine RPG lover I already know how to enjoy the good and endure the bad that comes with all RPGs. Bad things such as ridiculous damage sponge enemies, level difference penalties, unrealistic combat, hordes of enemies, enemy spawn nonsense, insane sick disgusting difficulty one moment and then super easy difficulty the next moment, death penalties, item costs, gear rarity issues, and general issues with leveling balances or progress impediments. Yep, this is an RPG through and through!!

Animations: **
-Enemies often move, idle, run and die in very comical ways. In fact, you might watch the enemies and think aloud, ""What was that? Seriously???"" For example, some of the gangsters wiggle and bobble like a cross between boxers hopping around like Muhammad Ali and zombies scrambling or shuffling. Not exaggerating. Memorizing enemy animations is key to headshot skills, so believe me, these animations are borderline silly at times.

Shooting/Smoothness: *****
-The gun mechanics are buttery smooth. Not only are there no complaints, but this game achieves what I only wish other similar games like Borderlands tried to do. Some games people just can't get the knack of, but in this game whether I used a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun or pistol, I felt epic and the shooting was incredible

RPG Elements: ****
-This game is VERY similar in game play and RPG mixture styles to Borderlands and Destiny. Loved Borderlands but hated its shooting, all around hated Destiny. This game is takes the best. The RPG elements are more diluted but the talents and perks system work just like it. I only wish Borderlands was this smooth.

Action and Mission Basics:
-Basically nonstop but plenty of time to explore without constant spawns breaking down the quiet exploration of the dying city. Side missions get very repetitive fast but reaching level 30 and burning a week on this game is well played time because the world and RPG elements keep you going strong to get great gear and blast more heads with fewer shots, amplifying the action it offers. Despite the repetition, anyone who has ever loved RPGs like Path of Exile, DOTA or Diablo 2 will not be bothered at all by the side missions, in fact the predictable nature of them are a comfort since you have a foreknowledge of what the mission will throw at you, giving you the ability to plan, predict, and even wander safely into much higher level areas. A little knowledge is a lot of power in this game.

Graphics: *****
-Beats the Witcher 3 and GTA5 by a fair bit, but it helps that this game uses so much shadow-play in the landscape to really achieve its look. The game is nothing shy of visually impeccable. Though games like the Witcher 3 and GTA5 take on far more effects in their worlds, there is plenty of light, weather and atmospheric changes in Division to still say its visually superior to either of these games. If you can run GTA5 and Witcher 3 on max like I can (R9 390 35-45 FPS) then this game will run fine. I average 50 FPS all graphics maxed with minor dips here and there. Most PC Ubisoft games run about as smoothy as a person being thrown in a woodchipper but Ubisoft looks like to have achieved better optimizations in this game than its previous games.

Story: *
-What story? Not really any story, but more like snippets of peoples' experiences strewn throughout the world. Doom 3 had a similar method to allow the player to hear the story but even its story and delivery was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better. hence the 1 star on this facet of the game. That should give you an idea! It bothers me that the previews and trailers for the game made the Division look like an epic story but saying there is no story at all is almost totally accurate. The voice acting and dialogue is oppressively depressing, generic and dissatisfying. One of the characters Faye Lau talks over walkie-talkie a lot during missions and she irritated me the entire game. Her dialogue is so bad! Oh my lands, so bad! And you're going to hear it a lot since this game will make you grind main missions to get great gear. You will memorize the bland, sparse dialogue better than Jack Van Impe quotes the Bible!!!! The game's story is barely more than cliche chatter. For heaven's sake, it's irritating to be called ""Agent."" Every five seconds you're called Agent, but that would make sense for a fully customized character, but Division has only character presets. The character creation is not fit to even be called character customization. There's no reason why you, the player, should not have a voice in the game and a name. There really is NOTHING holding this game together beyond gear hunting and shooting people.

DARK ZONE: *
-This is where the game dies, fayls, explodes with misery and causes casual players to rage quit or have to buy a new monitor from the FURY this zone induces in anyone who just wants to get in, get some needed gear then GTFO asap because even getting out is almost impossible. So you hit level 30 in the story world, you beat the story missions, completed your Base of Operations and now you don't know what to do. Your regular Credits no longer have use, and then you realize you've started earning minuscule amounts of Phoenix Credits and on top of it when you go into the Dark Zone entrance you see gear selling for DZ Funds... 3 currencies in one game? And the prices are astronomical. Astronomical, as in the word ""astronomy"" denoting stellar distances lol because that's how far you'll have to go to get a single piece of high end gear from a vendor!! Get in your rocket ship to spend the next 81,000 years flying at 35,000MPH to reach our nearest star Proxima Centauri, lol or I should say to buy one item that is of scarce improvement over your current gear.
.....
Well, screw that, you'll just go find the gear instead! So you go out into the DZ to hunt DZ money, phoenix credits and high end drops from elite named baddies and try to do your thing to keep the game going. But then a 4 man rogue party comes and shoots you dead in one bullet because they are geared to the teeth, then they steal your DZ Funds, all the loot you found and you de-level from death penalties in the DZ (not actual level, your DZ level which opens up new gear to buy and find). Wow, ok, maybe it was bum luck. You go back in and...a mob of lv32 all Elite enemies spawns ON TOP OF YOU quite literally. They aren't even fully loaded yet but they are already shooting you dead. You run away down the block to take cover and regroup your position to tactically kill then but then another mob of Superior enemies spots you and also starts shooting from down the other road you ran down. So then you barely run away from the two mobs but then run INTO ANOTHER MOB and ANOTHER and ANOTHER until you run out of health packs and cannot even run anymore. So you take cover, deploy some healing skills and slowly regenerate your health. Oh if only it were that easy, the enemies RUSH you relentlessly no matter how many you kill in a row. Some tactical shooter my butt! Then really grit your teeth to die like a man and so you plop down to fight in your new corner. About halfway into the 10 mobs chasing you, rushing you, grenading you out of your precious cover (heaven forbid if they even twitched a muscle when you throw a grenade) you realize you're out of ammo because every enemy takes about 15 (LITERALLY) perfectly aimed 150,000 damage headshots. So you finally say SCREW THIS when you see a gap in the mob and make a desperate run to a nearby safe room. SORRY, you cannot enter the SAFE ROOM while enemies are chasing you...WHAA? How is a safe room even safe if you CAN'T take refuge there when you actually need to be safe from danger? Why not call it a USELESS ROOM? So before the enemies catch up, you try to make a break for the DZ exit. Sorry, you can't leave the DZ while in combat. You turn around but see no one. Oh wait, the mob that is 10 blocks away is still chasing you despite the tremendous gap between you and them. So then they catch up and guess what? You get gunned down at the exit door with no med kits and no ammo and no special abilities. You're beaten down like a whipped dog. Worn down by their relentless, irritating, unrealistic pursuit. Why do they pursue you? Because. And guess what? That half hour you spent trying to escape them? Guess what it got you? De-leveled again and lost even more money. Guess what again? The game spawns you at the nearest Safe House. You still have to run 10 blocks through enemies just to exit the DZ hahahaha. How cruel. How sickly cruel. And you will have to keep running and dying like this until you finally get out successfully or you will be trapped in the DZ literally forever. So then you finally leave and a week later after foolishly forgetting how ridiculously overpowering the enemies are, you come back with epic gear and die again like a dog. So, now you're mad. You get your buddies to buy the game. You make yourself a great team of 4 people. Yeah now we're talking, those elite enemies are melting like butter now. Look at all of that great gear they drop when they actually die! Oh man! This is great! At least until a hacker or exploiter comes and kills your entire team with one grenade that does 20,000,000 damage (LITERALLY), steals all of your teams' gear and money. Ok maybe it's just one jerk in thousands being a loser. Let's not get too discouraged because we were on a roll! We can do this! Then you repeat, you spend 2 hours killing special named enemies for drops and finally you and your team call in a helicopter to extract all the great contaminated loot you found in the DZ in order to permanently keep it (all gear must be extracted to actually keep it all). The helicopter takes 90 seconds to come. Alright, here comes the swarms of baddies to try to thwart your success! As you're killing all of the baddies down drops a rope to hang all your loot on to extract and then BANG. During the chaos of the fighting a very high gear scored (204+) rogue party shoots you all down in half a second, kills the remaining baddies you were painstakingly fending off with hard work and effort, then they steal your entire teams' gear and money THEN USES YOUR HELICOPTER TO EXTRACT THE GEAR YOU SPENT 2 HOURS HUNTING. Ok, get the picture? Don't go into the freaking dark zone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The hackers are every where. I can't emphasize this enough. This rant above is a real experience. There is NO exaggeration in here. This is a real, actual Dark Zone grinding experience. I reached level 38 in the DZ, I have a gear score of 169, 90,000 health and 150,000 damage per headshot and these rogues don't just gun me and my team down, THEY PASTE US UTTERLY because even when they aren't cheating they are also totally outclassing you gear-wise. I can get headshots all day long without missing but the RPG elements in this game negate actual skill in many instances.

In Call of Duty a headshot is difficult yet rewarding as it offers an instant kill like in real life. In this game you can dump 800 bullets into an enemy's face and the guy will still be no where near death. While the enemies are no where near as bad as ones in Destiny, this is the major annoyance as Tom Clancey games have always at least attempted some modicum of realistic combat. Well kiss that goodbye in this game. This game is much more like Borderlands and Destiny than it is like any shooter you've likely ever played.

Overall I love this game. Just stay the hell out of the Dark Zone for heaven's sake!","The Division- The Good, The Bad and The Ugly",1462752000,38,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The writing is bad, there are numerous cheesy jokes/references that don't fit with the story at all, and it's very generic in a lot of ways.

Some slightly nitpicky things:
This may just be me, but it was easy for me to get lost on the map at times.  Mostly due to the fact that if I ever forgot where I was supposed to be headed and went back to ask an NPC to repeat his directions, most of the time they would be saying something else, instead.  That sucks if you've turned off the game and forgotten the previous conversation.  Even just having a world map would have been helpful.
It's hard to care at all about any of the characters, even the main character.  It takes awhile to find shops that sell armor and weapons that are actually helpful to more than one or two characters, which wouldn't be so bad if the game wasn't so short anyway.
I actually thought the graphics were cute (I tend to lean towards RPGs that are more old-fashioned), but everything is so tiny it's impossible sometimes to tell what objects you can and can't interact with in a room.
Around 4 or 5 hours into it, when I finally got more people in my party, it started getting a little more interesting.  But personally the two biggest things I enjoy about RPGs are a good storyline and a fun time, and this game seemed to fall flat.

So I'd recommend buying it cheap/used or renting it rather than buying it at full price.","worth renting, probably not buying",1255737600,,,
3.0,False,"04 30, 2009",A2HX83TUM905UD,B000UU5T7E,Oliver Leland,"It surprises me that in spite of all the obvious TLC that went into Fallout 3, no one in Bethesda thought to give it decent storyline. Interesting characters introduced at the beginning of the game will never be heard from again. Your rivaling faction will get in your way maybe twice, then simply disappear after a ho-hum fireworks show. And, to add insult to injury, the game doesn't even have an end-boss. That's right, all that leveling and gun-tuning won't mean a damned thing in the final chapter of Fallout 3 - you'll be fighting trash mobs from the beginning of the game to the end of it. Don't bother saving those Mini Nukes.

What a shame. Underneath the narrative, there is a time consuming and entertaining video game in Fallout 3. The mechanics of combat are so fun, that I actually looked forward to enemy combat (whereas in too many RPGs I find myself dreading it). There's lots of great weaponry, towns, characters, monsters, and items. The side-quests are often fairly engaging and satisfying. The gameplay is open-ended (for the most part), and runs smoothly on my mid-low range laptop.

But what good is it all in a game that is so driven by a narrative that could pass as a poorly written fan fiction?

3.0,True,"10 29, 2016",A287TAETJKLNKI,B01D14TXTU,I Like Stuff,"Impressive quality case. I was looking for basic protection for my new modded DS4 controller so I didn't expect a lot for the price but was impressed with what I got.

The case comes loosely wrapped in a plastic bag and along with the case they include a silver colored carabiner that actually seems pretty decent. The inside of the case also has a mesh elastic pocket on the top portion of the case which I imagine is to hold a cable for your controller.

The shell material is reasonably sturdy and feels of good quality materials. There are two zipper pulls made of rubber and the zip is smooth and nice. The most surprising part for me was the interior lining of the case. It isn't just that felt-like material, it is very lush soft material that looks and feels very nice.

Now despite me being pleasantly surprised by the case there are a few issues with the case and one that would be a deal breaker for some. The main issue is that when the case closes, there is little to no clearance for the standard joysticks meaning that any stress put on the case is directly putting stress on the joysticks. You can actually lightly press the outside of the case near the joysticks and feel the click of R3 and L3.  This seems to equal little protection for the joysticks which defeats the purpose of a protective travel case.

Now for myself, I modded the controller to use the Xbox One Elite removable joysticks so if I remove the joysticks for storage then the case can still work well to protect the controller. You could even store the joysticks in the netted mesh pocket but if stored loosely in this pocket, they will be loose in the case.

Speaking of the mesh pocket, it seems to be mostly useless. I've tried storing a cable but even with my joysticks removed, there just isn't enough clearance for the cable to fit well with the controller. You can make it fit but I'm not looking to squeeze everything into this case.

Considering this happens to work for me I'm willing to give it 3 stars but considering most won't have removable joysticks, I just can't recommend this for protecting your DS4 for travel. If you know what you're getting here, don't mind the issues, and appreciate the quality of the case then it's not bad but buyer beware.

3.0,False,"04 24, 2010",A1VBMM3SCBOA9M,B0017IUFAE,B. Cooper,"After finding a disheartening lack of comparative reviews online I decided that I would write about my own experiences with the above headphones.  This review is targeted only at headphones for gaming based on sound from a PS3 slim connected via Monster Ultra Fiber Optic and set to Dolby Digital. I understand there are significantly more options than those I have tested.  However, my wish is to give a first-person detailed and reliable account regarding the phones I currently or have previously owned. For a summary of what I found just scroll to the bottom of the review.

As a sidenote I have watched just about every youtube video, read every gaming website review, and scanned through every forum in my search for audio bliss.  This is the cumulation of my knowledge and experiences.

  Originally I had wanted an all in one processor for DTS and Dolby Digital with a simulated surround sound.  I watch most movies and play most games at night, and was trying to ""kill a few birds with one stone"" on this one.  After round 1 of extensive research I settled on the Sennheiser RS130s.  I bought two sets.  The sound was pretty good.  I could not detect ANY simulated surround, but for watching movies the dialogue was VERY bright and enjoyable.  In addition there was no interference with my Wii or PS3 due to the RF and the charging system was a good setup.  Unfortunately, the wireless was also the problem.  I tried switching through every single channel and resetting the base unit.  I consistently got a weird ""modem"" buzzing and clicking sound in the background.  Some people might be able to overlook it, but I definitely could not.  Back they went and back I went to burning my eyes reading everything online.

  Round 2  I decided to bite the bullet, and ordered the Sony MDR-DS7000 headphones from Japan, complete with a second set of phones.  They cost me a pretty penny.  Once they arrived I tested the voltage coming through the adapter from Japan and found it was much higher than the 9V required for the processor and phones when plugged into a US 120V outlet.  After shelling out another $120 for 3 adapters from the Sony MDR-DS6000 series available in the US (courtesy of Sony Style) I was finally able to make sure I hadn't been ripped off from overseas. (The headphones each use 1 adapter to charge the lithium ion batteries.  The 3rd is for the Processor.) I was quite satisfied to learn that my bluray, ps3 and wii could all be connected to the same unit.  Also, the sound was absolutely crystal clear without a single beep or incoming fax noise.  Lord of the Rings sounded great and the VPT surround sound cinema mode made the movie sound like it was being played in a large theatre room.  Pretty cool, but not really the ""surround sound"" I had hoped for.  Still....it was an improvement from the Sennheisers.  And so I proceeded for a few months before deciding that I'd like to get a system more suitable for the PS3.  The large hall effect didn't really seem like it was cutting it anymore.  So I considered: Should I try ordering the newly improved MDR-DS7100?  Hmm...probably not since they just increased the battery life by 3 hours, and increased the drivers from 40mm to 50mm.  The surround effect would be the same.  I also considered the Pioneer SE-Dir800c once again, but decided against it based on a few factors. The headphones break in nearly 60% of consumer reviews at a swivel point, the batteries (AA) must be charged separately from the unit, the system only has 1 fiber optic input, and additional headphones are only sold in Japan (unless you want to buy a 2nd transmitter as well).  It seemed like a lot of trouble, even though I've read almost 2 million times by now that Dolby Headphone technology is vastly superior to Sony's Virtual Phone Technology. And so we come to Round 3: The Tritton Ax Pros.

  A long time ago, before my head was filled with all sorts of useless information on headphones, I owned the Tritton AxPros.  This was back when people cared less about how they sounded and more about getting sent the wrong set from Amazon or having to look for places to plug in 2 adapters. OMG! 2 adapters! Yeah...I have a surge protector...not a big deal.  Back in those times I was very impressed with the quality of the Trittons for 3d mapping in games.  Resistance: Fall of Man and other games from way back in the long long ago sounded significantly better when played through the headphones.  The only problem was that finding the proper EQ was a pain and my neck felt like I was wearing Rampage Jackson's chains around my neck after playing.  After contacting customer service and adjusting the delay to +10,  and decreasing the rear speaker and sub (which felt like it would blow out my eardrum on normal) I was satisfied.  Looking back I can safely say that my complete satisfaction was, in part, due to my lack of anything to compare sound quality towards.  Fast forward to now.  After not quite getting the full experience from the Sony headphones, I decided to repurchase the ""newly improved"" Tritton Axpros I had been so fond of.  When I got my new set I looked over it for a long time.  The AC adapter is definitely ""cheaper"" than both of the older ones (lighter less durable plastic), even though there is now only 1.  The break-away cable is a good feature, although you still have to roll it up the same as if you just disconnected it from the decoder box.  The microphone has gotten a MUCH needed improvement and is now rubberized/bendable and works a lot better.  The headphones still shine a halloween orange glow through the Tritton logo.  They also still induce serious headaches from squishing your head like a vice.  Funny enough, they actually do not weigh much more than my Sonys.  The difference is that Sony has a second band to turn the headphones on that takes most of the pressure off from the top and sides of your head.  Tritton has no such feature, but feels much sturdier (like it was carved from a plastic tree).  The Tritton also has the individual speaker adjustment, as before, with different colors for different sound levels.  This works fine, but a digital +1, +2, +8 numerical readout would be much better.  Each color level has 3 or 4 levels before bumping to the next color.  Between white and red (medium and max) is ""cyan"" which is the high volume level.  This would be fine if you could ACTUALLY TELL a difference from the white.  I believe the Cyan simply leaves the white light on while simultaneously turning on the blue. The problem is that the white light completely overpowers everything else. It looks like the volume goes straight from white to red after about 8 clicks.  Pretty dumb.  Use purple or yellow or a black light. Don't try to combine colors to cut costs Tritton!  The newer model also has the feature of being able to turn off the inline controller by holding the ""mute and front speaker"" buttons for a few seconds.  Here's the problem with that:  1.)when turning the system back on you're usually holding the mute button so it mutes everything.  The way the mute/volume is set up you usually end up also raising the volume as you unmute it.  You probably shouldnt have the headphone on when turning the inline controller on anyway since it makes a HUGEEE POP noise when powering on that almost makes your ears bleed.  This doesn't even power the unit itself on though. It just powers up the phones. The Dolby decoder box has a completely separate power on button.  So.....they took away one AC adapter, but actually made it just as much of a pain in the A*$ to turn on and off.  Here's the rub though - when you turn off the main decoder box, it resets your settings.  That's right.  All of the DRC, Sound Delay (Center and Surround) and master volume settings you pulled out the decoder box to program have all been reset.  At first I kept thinking to myself, dang...the game sounds different everytime I turn it back on again...I must have not put the time delay on the right setting.  After testing it though...I found the cause.  Maybe mine's defective because I don't remember my old unit ever doing this. Must be an ""improvement"" eh? Now for the sound quality.

  Discrete sounds and directions.  This is where the Tritton Axpros start to do something right.  I switched the fiber optic input from my Sony MDR-DS7000 into the Pros back and forth about 50 times.  I tried it with Uncharted 1 + 2, God of War 3, God of War Trilogy, Infamous, Killzone 2, Modern Warfare 1 and 2, Battlefield: BC2 and Bioshock 2.  Results were surprising.  The AxPros actually blew the Sony's out of the water.  In Battlefield, when I swung the knife I could hear it echo in the winter mountains and the fires flickered on different sides as I walked.  Riding the vehicles sounded like I was right there.  Modern Warfare 1 and Uncharted 1 were actually the most remarkable.  In Modern Warfare 1 I could hear the helicopters flying overhead and DIRECTLY pinpoint where they were.  I tried about 10 times to close my eyes and see if I could locate a circling helicopter.  I was right 9/10 times.  The Sony headphones (playing on the dedicated PS3 ""game"" mode) were extremely muffled.  Gunshots sounded tiny and shallow.  The Trittons just made it seem like I was right there in the environment.  In Uncharted I kept restarting the 2nd scene in the jungle and testing the sounds while running through the creeks, in and out of the waterfall, and through the group of birds.  With the Trittons it sounded like I was right there.  With the Sony's it sounded like I was listening through a set of headphones.  Then---slowly---as I listened to Sully talk about finding his ""bride in a brothel"" for the 20th time, I realized I was missing a vital part of the puzzle. Dialogue.  Take this into perspective. The Sony's have 2 dedicated 40mm drivers.  The Trittons have 8- 30mm drivers.  Usually dialogue is only going through 1 set of speakers (center or front) on the Trittons, depending on the game.  The driver quality is also considerably lower than the neodymium found in the Sony's.  I went back and listened to Modern Warfare 1 and Bioshock 2.  Then I listened to dialogue on Infamous and on God of War 3.  Holy Jeez!  The Trittons were cutting out some of the dialogue or seriously distorting it.  This wasn't during key story moments when everything was evenly balanced.  Rather, it is when multiple things are going on at once.  Funny enough, this is one of the MAJOR things that all the Astro supporters were talking about when discussing potential missteps with multiple drivers.  In a helicopter scene on Modern Warfare I could barely make out what people were saying over the radio.  On Bioshock 2 the radio feeds were slightly distorted. On Infamous all of the ""S"" sounds in dead drops or phone calls came across like static on a radio.  On God of War 3 on the ending fight (as Zeus is floating down towards Gaia's heart) he shouts ""Hmmm....Kratosss..."" in this weird almost comical way.  When playing through on the Sonys I could hear it clearly and it always made me laugh after I died for the 50th time.  When using the Trittons...I couldn't even hear him say it.  I could faintly hear ""Hm....SSS.""  I tried adjusting all of the sound levels individually and could not bring out that line of dialogue.  So, after all of my research I started asking myself, would I be missing more dialogue on other games if I stuck with the Trittons?  I can't look past the fact that while multiple drivers does = better immersion, it also means less clarity.  I also agree with the claim someone else on some distant site said: Sound has a few dead zones on the Trittons.  When turning you will clearly notice a sound jump from one speaker to the next. It's not a terrible thing.  Some might even like it due to its similarity to real 5.1 setups.  But in a video game, if you have that right spot the sound starts to vanish unless you keep turning.  I was told that decreasing the surround effect negates this effect, but that comes at the cost of reducing the 3d effect.  This is what got me thinking about the Dolby Headphone systems.

  I read all about using the Astro Mixamp with other headphones: Beyerdynamic 880s, Sennheiser 555s, 595s, Audio Technica Ath AD700s, AD900s.  I wasn't so into researching the Turtle Beach wireless because it uses infrared and has a mic that will not connect to a PS3.  If I wanted a standalone infrared processor...I'd just go with the Pioneer SE-DIR800c which are also great for movies even though they'll be duct-taped in about a week due to their fragility.  I looked at the JVC dolby processor, but read in a few places it has a small lag between what you see and hear.  The Astro Mixamp seems quite good, and a LOT more accessible/user friendly than the AXPROs.  Most reviews have stated that the Astro headset is fairly comparable to the Tritton Axpros, so I cannot justify spending an extra $100 for such a slight upgrade. The exposed wire on the Astro set also seems like a bad design flaw. Most websites give the Astros a 9.0 and the AxPros an 8.8.  If I truly wanted an upgrade in soudstage and quality, I'd have to purchase an audiophile set of headphones such as those listed above. So that's exactly what I did.

 I ordered the Audio Technica ATH-A900 headphones in addition to the Astro dolby mixamp.  After connecting them together I ran extensive tests using all of the same games as before: God of War 3, Uncharted 1 +2, Infamous, Call of Duty MW 1 +2, Killzone 2, and Battlefield BC 2.
First and foremost, the setup was MUCH simpler than the Trittons.  The mixamp is powered by AND provides voice chat through the single USB cable.  The ATH-A900s are also lightyears ahead of the AXpros in terms of comfort (using a wing stabilizer to decrease weight).  They are VERY large, but since they are closed they keep sound in/out very well. I would say about the same as the Sony MDR-DS7000 headphones, and considerably better than the Trittons. If this isn't an issue for your household I would recommend the AD series since an open sound is slightly better for soundstage.  The mixamp uses a Dolby headphone type 2 configuration preset which is not user adjustable.  You get one surround/delay effect.  Depending on your view this can be a pro or a con.  On the one side, you simply plug in your headphones and start up your game.  On the flip side, those who enjoy tweaking surround levels and speaker volumes will be discouraged.  Personally I enjoy having everything tweaked to standardized optimal settings.  For all of the long hours I spent adjusting the Trittons I still never locked onto what I found to be a ""perfect"" setting.  Voice chat is also MUCH easier to control with the single balance knob of the Astro Mixamp.  The only problem is that without an inline volume control you will have to find your optimal volume level before sitting down to enjoy whatever game you are playing.  The mixamp is ""smarter"" than the Tritton Dolby box in that it turns itself off whenever the headphones are unplugged.  In addition if you have it powered via USB it will turn off whenever the USB power is turned off (in my case the PS3), even though you will have to manually turn it back on.  The portability of the mixamp may also factor into your decision since it can be powered via batteries, although this did not affect my review.  The first thing I noticed when playing Call of Duty was that dialogue was very bright and crisp.  It was SUBSTANTIALLY better than the AXPROs, and marginally better than the Sonys.  I would actually say it was most comparable to the dialogue from the Sennheisers I first owned, although lacking the annoying extraneous noises.  Without the Dolby Headphone mode it sounds exactly like what you would expect: sound through a pair of quality 2 speaker headphones.  However, with DH turned on the game gives you a very enjoyable out-of-head surround that easily surpasses the VPT of the Sony Headphones.  I will not lie though.  The 3d effect is definitely subpar compared to the effect of the Trittons.  In Call of Duty I could no longer pinpoint circling helicopters.  In Uncharted I could no longer hear strangle ambient jungle sounds as if they were all around me.  HOWEVER, (and this is the most important part of this review) sounds were distinctly more REALISTIC.  It seems like a strange trade-off.  In Battlefield BC 2  crackling fires and vehicles no longer sounded like they were in-my-face with the Audio Technicas.  Instead they sounded like a normal fire crackling on the ground.  In short, it no longer seemed like sounds were being ""forced"" into specific positions coming into my ears.  This is no easy task to convey.  The Sony headphones failed to convey the spatial quality of games in an accurate setting.  The Trittons created a very pleasing 3d effect but with diminishing realism for voice and sounds.  The Astro mixamp/audio technica setup slightly decreases the 3d effect but sounds EXACTLY like what I believe the sound engineers recorded.  Ultimately the preference is yours.  For games like Infamous the Astro/Technica setup blows everything else out of the water.  Not only was dialogue extremely clear, but the entire soundstage sounded realistically recreated for the city environment.  With the Trittons certain aspects were enjoyable (fountains, passing cars), while others were abysmal (scuttling trash monsters, yelling fans, distant gunshots).  Using the Audio Technica headphones I can hear every single detail I was missing with the Sony headphones, but also enjoy ultra realistic sound for everything else in-game.  Rear noise is easier to pinpoint with the Trittons, but I still get the same feeling of ""being there"" with the Audio Technicas.  From a trade-off perspective I would say that the Astro/Audio Technica setup definitely takes the crown.  I can put fifteen mini-speakers around my head and pinpoint EXACTLY where a crackling fire or babbling brook is located.  Yet if the speakers aren't great, will the sound QUALITY make it sound exactly like what a brook or fire should sound like?  Instead it sounds like a precisely located yet slightly unrealistic sound reproduction.  This is my best analysis of the Trittons vs ATH A900s.  The A900s sound like ""real water, or real fire.""  The trade-off is yours to decide between.

  Either way, The Trittons or Astro/Audio-Technica setup is still better than the Sony MDR-DS7000s for gaming. Your preference will determine what is the best fit for your style of gaming.  Based on my experieces I would say that since the new Tritton AX700 utilizes the same technology as the Astro set, it would be moot to compare similar technologies.  If you enjoy the Dolby Headphone processing of the mixamp, then it would be wise to get the astros based on the extent of other relevant gaming features.  If you desire an alternative surround experience, then go with a multi-speaker headphone setup.

IN SUMMATION:

Sony MDR-DS7000:
(+) Crystal Clear Static Free Wireless, Decodes Dolby and DTS, Multiple Fiber Optic Inputs, Long Battery Life, Very good for movies, Clear Dialogue, Can be used with a combination of analog and digital inputs
(- ) No microphone input for voice chat, Poor spatial mapping for gaming, VPT is a poor surround sound simulator, VERY costly to import from Japan, Needs alternative power supply or universal adapter

Dialogue: 8/10
Effects: 6/10
Ambient: 5/10
3d Mapping:4/10

Tritton AXPRO:
(+) BEST 3d mapping, Good integration of voice and in game volume, In-line volume adjustment, Very User Adjustable Sound Levels across all fields (speaker volume, delay setting, DRC), Good Immersion and Ambient Sounds, BEST VALUE for surround experience
(-) Most UNCOMFORTABLE of headphones tested, Tendency to distort or unrealistically convey dialogue and certain sounds, Most complicated to setup and fine tune to enjoyable settings, Poor on/off integration based on power being separated into decoder box and inline controller, Closed headphone design with open headphone sound leakage

Dialogue:6/10
Effects:7/10
Ambient:10/10
3d Mapping:9/10

Astro Mixamp w/ Audio Technica ATH-A900
(+) MOST REALISTIC sounds of all headphones, EXTREMELY Precise dialogue and sound effects, Very good out-of head 3d simulation based on Dolby Headphone technology, Integration of voice-chat and power source through single USB cable,  Extremely simple interface, Highest level of connectivity and portability for competitive gamers or LAN parties, Most comfortable of headphones tested
(-) Not quite as good Rear Surround as Trittons, Less Ambient effect heard in background

Dialogue:10/10
Effects:9/10
Ambient:8/10
3d Mapping:7/10

Personally, I prefer the Astro/Audio Technica combination above the others.  It is probably the most enjoyable surround experience I have had when playing a videogame through headphones.  As such, if you do a LOT of voice chat and online play then I would probably suggest purchasing the complete Astro setup for the use of their headset microphone (which from what I have read is stellar).  If you care less for voice chat than detailed immersion (but cost is a factor) then go with the ATH-A700s and Astro Mixamp.  If you prefer extreme 3d mapping and may or may not be on a budget, go with the Trittons. If you hate wires, then go wireless with Turtle beach or the Sonys from above. If you are like me and play most games without voice chat and demand high quality crisp dialogue and effect then go with the Astro/ATH900 setup.

Hope all of the time I spent writing this helps you decide what is most important to you.","DETAILED COMPARISON: Tritton AXPRO, Sony MDR-DS7000 + Audio Technica ATH-A900 w/ Astro Mixamp",1272067200,289,,

You're Marshall James Anderson, a former lawman who takes up the badge again when a railroad baron's goons kill your wife and kidnap your daughter. You'll fight through nine stages, including ghost towns, mines, cliff dwellings, and saw mills on your quest for revenge. Bonus missions send you on bounty-hunting quests for those thugs you never saw during the main game. Lucasarts really nailed the spaghetti western atmosphere and trappings with lots of animated cutscenes and excellent voice work. You can also pop the game CDs into your CD player and hear the highly memorable full-length soundtrack.

But there are problems with Outlaws' gameplay. The environments are still pretty decent, but the enemy sprites were average by 1996 standards, and look pretty bad today. Some of the levels can be disorienting and confusing, and the missions fall into key hunts that aren't much better than the original DOOM. There's really no sense of direction except to run around and open passages until you meet the boss. Bosses aren't as distinctive as in other games, and you might not know you've killed one until the game jumps to a cutscene. To its credit, Outlaws included elements that later became staples of the shooter genre, including having to manually reload (bullet by bullet!), a sniper rifle, and a stamina meter where your character becomes slower and out of breath the longer you run.

I can't say there's much reason to buy this title today if you've been raised on shooters like Half-Life and Halo, but if you're a collector of Lucasarts games and want to experience the high-quality cutscenes and soundtrack, Outlaws is a must-have.",The new sheriff in town,1125878400,2,,

Playing this game is like playing a mashup of Bioshock and Assassin's Creed.

It takes a special type of player to not only find the creative solutions all the time, but to also do so in a totally non disruptive way to the ideas of the game.  I may not quite be it.

This game is a ton of fun. You WILL find yourself leaning to the right as you try to reach enough so that your hatchet connects with the Swadian Footman whose group ambused your trading party. You'll also find unexpected joy in a well-placed headshot (with a recurve bow, no less) that reduces your foes by one.

System-wise, it's also not very demanding, which is a relief given how rapidly the tit-for-tat of hardware and software developers keep pushing each other to their limits.

However, there are limits to the fun that is to be had. Dialogue is very basic, as are the quests. Interaction is similar to Freelancer (though text-only) in its repetition. Your quests come down to: deliver a message, collect a debt, train villagers, bring us some cattle, and kill this criminal. There are also only five kingdoms - I was hoping for a few more, just to make it interesting - and the entire landscape can be crossed in about 2 days of game time, provided you aren't ambused by looters or bandits in the process.

3.0,True,"05 20, 2011",A2UUIHOKCQOK7V,B004CVWETI,Truenikos,"In this game, Locke, a brooding loner hero with a troubled past must go on a dangerous mission for his country.  As luck would have it, turns out the world is dying, and now he has to fix that too.  The story and characters are interesting - I found myself desiring to know more about them.  The battle system is also enjoyable early on.  The key mechanics are swapping turns with enemies to setup chain combos, and using skills to reposition enemies to attack multiple baddies at once.  All in all, good ideas.

I have two major gripes with the game that bring down it's score.  First, 80% of the game is spent running through fields and plains to get to where the story is, all the while fighting random monsters.  (You can avoid the battles, but you do need XP.)  The remainder of your fights will be 'Cut and Paste Soldier A, B, and C.'  As you level up, damage scales a little slower than HP, so you'll find these pointless battles take longer, especially when monsters hide in the back row and take reduced damage, and you don't have a party member with grapple at the time.

The second gripe is how the time travel plot hook is used.  Generally, at any point in time, there are only two possibilities for outcomes.  If you come across a decision, you either make the right one and proceed, or make the wrong one, and it's game over, back to the decision point so you can make the right one.  Then, at certain points, you will be unable to proceed in one timeline until you go to the other timeline and do something silly and arbitrary.  For example, spending 10 seconds mastering a sword dance, or giving a character a pep talk.  Even though the timelines run parallel, for some reason, giving a guy a pep talk in one makes him different in the other.  Strangely, though, the sidequests come up with more interesting ways to use the time travel mechanic, as NPCs ask for stuff that can only be obtained in the past or the future, so I can't imagine why the main quest got the shaft.  After all, there are games like Chrono Trigger where using time travel brings on interesting effects or consequences.  Here, there are no such effects or consequences.  There is one way to proceed throughout the main story and the game won't let you forget it.  Ever.

3.0,True,"02 3, 2017",A3CS3M8A864S71,B01GW3POY0,Mgus,"I have played every single Resident Evil game since #1 on the original Playstation.  When you compare the games, 1-3 are in a league of their own.  Those games offered tons of puzzles, a constantly limited inventory, and in my opinion offered true survival horror.  Then 4 came around, and I must say I actually appreciated the more fast action pace of the game.  A lot more zombies and shooting, with some sense of puzzle solving.  4 stood alone and did right.

Then came 5 and 6.  These games brought online into the mix and very fast paced action.  This is when Resident Evil fell apart and lost every bit of survival horror it had.  It lost its identity.  Enough said.

What Resident Evil means to me, is a mystery where you are constantly searching for clues. You have to be cautious and move around every corner with fear of your life no zombie or thing will take you down.  Lets me be real for a second here.  A zombie is about the size of you.  It should not be so easy to take down.  Realistically if you only have 4 bullets for your handgun and a couple shotguns shells so be it.  You may have to run past that zombie or at least take a couple shots so it falls to the ground and you can get around it. (Not taking down what seams like 100 zombies with unlimited amount of ammo laying around all over the place! <RE 5 and 6 that is> )

I haven't even touched on 7 yet......

Resident Evil 7 learned from ""The Last of Us"" and went back to its roots.  Survival horror did come back.  A limited inventory did come back and (some) puzzle solving did come back.  Thats all a good thing.  I enjoyed the story and my run around the Estate in my roughly 10 hour play through.  There were some scary moments and they did a great job with all the visuals.  If you get a chance to play it in VR it was very well done.  You really feel like you are the main character running around fighting for your life.

Now for my issue that brings this down to 3 stars.  This game felt like a scripted movie with too many action sequences.  The first 3 hours were very linear with no big sense of exploration.  There were many jump scares and such, but I never really got lost in this game.  I found it pretty simple to find my way around the Estate.  There were only 3 main types of keys you had to find and and I almost felt as though I was guided with clues before I could even have a chance to solve/explore for myself.  To add to this, there there were basically 3 very similar enemies in this game.  No real diversity here.  Also boss fights were more frustrating than enjoyable.  Basically shooting at targets multiple times before it goes down. (Don't even get me started with the last boss of the game)

In closing, will you enjoy this game?  More likely yes.  Is worth your time?  Yes.  Will it go down as a masterpiece?  No, but it will be the pioneer of a true full length VR game.  This series is going in the right direction but it needs to be beefier.  It needs to be longer, add more enemies, less linear, and allow for more exploration so the user can get back to solving puzzles like the good old days.","I have played them all, 0-7",1486080000,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",
3.0,True,"10 1, 2011",AL53XOAPH8N4H,B001UWGCW2,Craig A. Youngman,"This game is a bit like Bioshock and even more like Dark Sector. In fact, I get the distinct impression that this is the game that Dark Sector wanted to be if it had a higher budget- only without the fun of getting to throw the glaive with it's aftertouch ability. The biggest problems with this game are that the controls aren't customizeable, and you don't get to save when you want. The save problem wouldn't be so bad except the entire first half to two-thirds of the game is full of tedious, annoying missions like an escort mission (ugh!), chase down the guys who captured whatsername before they kill her, and- my personal ""favorite""- run through tunnels full of toxic gas with the world's worst gas mask that runs out of oxygen every 30 seconds and therefore needs constant replenishing while you try to figure out how to open the stupid door that will finally get you out of there... I had to play through these entire areas over and over until I figured out what to do, where to go, and how to get there. Also, I get that its more realistic to only be able to carry two guns at a time like in Dark Sector, but it then has the same problem in that you often get into an area where you really wish you'd brought something else. You can pick up weapons dropped by enemies and they will have a particular gun conveniently placed in sections where you absolutely have to have it, but it still feels like there could be a better way...

Oddly though, once I ""stubborned"" my way through all this not-fun decided-twice-to-give-up junk in the first half or so, the game really picked up. The stupid tedium gave way to some real combat (gotta say, the gore is cool), some of the weapons and abilities got pretty fun after a few upgrades, and even the previously mediocre surroundings were replaced by really nice, creative environments. Its almost like someone barged in while they were halfway through the game and said, ""Hey! You're screwing up the game! Get away from there and lemme show you how its done!""

So, basically, if you can buy this game real cheap and muster the immense patience/tenacity it takes to get through the first bit, you'll be rewarded with some real fun. Otherwise, get Bioshock and/or Bioshock 2, a $5 copy of Dark Sector, or stick with your favorite FPS.","Deeply flawed, but eventually gets fun.",1317427200,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",
3.0,False,"04 20, 2009",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000ZK696O,Cloud,"As I was in the store, mind deadest on buying ""Ninja Gaiden II"" for the Xbox 360, a question ran through my head: ""am I this crazy?"" I mean after all, Sigma on the Playstation 3 was frequently frustrating but it was one that you got better at over time. NGII on the other hand I played previously, found it borderline controller-throwing and figured no game is worth this frustration so why am I in the store buying it? It's really the combat system which is arguably, for me anyway, the funnest and most satisfying of the fighting styles, easily besting those in God of War, Devil May Cry, Heavenly Sword or even something like Prince of Persia games. But you know what? That doesn't excuse the poor cheap hits, odd bits of programming and large amount of enemies and this makes this a game that's incredibly hard to love.

Story: There's a cutscene in the game where a werewolf named Volf (Volf the Wolf...lot of thought into that name, no?) declares to his minion werewolves that he wants an adversary worthy of him. That's all you need to know about this story: it's frequently stupid, doesn't make sense and is just a placeholder for the sexy violence. There's some kind of baddie who wants to revive a potentially world-destroying Archfiend and yeah, Ryu's the man to stop everybody's plans.

Graphics: Team Ninja's animators do really great jobs at delivering not only fast combat but having it be as fluid as possible and seeing Ryu jump, dash and slice his way on screen is quite something to watch. Cutscenes look great and certain locales are quite stunning. However there is one thing they still haven't been able to perfect which is the skin on characters. Quite frankly, they look like shiny mannequins and even with Dead or Alive 4 released several years ago, they still haven't fixed this. Oh and we get it Team Ninja: you love bouncy breasts.

Sound/Music: The music's quite dynamic, epic and nicely energetic though not memorable in terms of melodies but it provides an adequate soundtrack at your demon slaying parties while sound effects from roars to swishes of the blade(s) are very good at making the hits and kills that much sweeter. As for voice acting? Keep it on Japanese with English subtitles since the story and the VA becomes a hell of a lot more tolerable. I don't know why it is but even a flatly-delivered line in Japanese sounds cooler than English.

Gameplay: Team Ninja are notoriously in love for difficult games; ones that challenge you and push you to the brink but at a certain point you got to ask yourself: is the game worth it if I'm madder at the game the more and more I play it? That's the crux and indeed the proverbial straw that might make you stop playing this. I find it funny on the back of the game's box is mentions that having the ability for save points to replenish your health or major battles will refill your health bar is helpful to a ""casual gamer"". Well you know what? Having played all Devil May Cry games, God of War as well as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, I honestly don't get how they think this game will be easy to Ninja Gaiden newbies or veterans since it frequently adds things detrimental to the enjoyment of it all. Enemies throw exploding shurikens with reckless abandon. Enemies with rocket launchers. Giant mechs in addition to enemies with rocket launchers. Then we have all 3 at once and yeah, this game can frequently get unfair. The game was even winning me over with parts that were challenging but not too bad but then boom, one annoyance after another.

And all of this is further enhanced by one of the worst cameras you'll ever be in control of. This camera seems to love the scenery and you more than showing you what you're doing and very frequently I'd have to reposition the camera just to figure out what's going on or who hit me or where that enemy came from. I get that the kill animations wouldn't be as impressive if it was like God of War's camera being your eye-in-the-sky but at least then you could figure out what was going on in the battlefield. Like Tomb Raider games, you'd think with reviews and fans complaining of bad cameras, Team Ninja would go ""damn, we should fix that camera problem next game"" but apparently not. Game's so difficult even the game does stuff that'll make it easier to kill you faster.

Now the game as I mentioned way above has probably the most visceral and all-around entertaining fighting combat systems around. Sure it's really just LT to block, X for weak, Y for strong like most games but honestly; being able to go all over the screen tearing enemies apart limb by limb has never felt as rewarding as this. Like I said, save points can regenerate you to full health while major battles can heal you fully after they're done (provided you don't have any red sections) and the wealth of weapons make it apparently easy to make it through the game. Also thankfully, Team Ninja toned down the precision-based platforming sections as well as those damned ghost fish though in their place are respawning jelly fish that explode,  a boss that explodes and kills you unless you hold block (chapter 7, so I save you the aggravation of replaying him) and an item limit of 3....3! You can only carry 3 of each item and yeah, fun fighting, annoying game design.

I wish Team Ninja didn't make such frustrating and difficult games since they'd make some of the best action games around but alas, if you're going to get into this, make sure you're not the controlling-throwing kind.",3.5; it ain't easy being a ninja,1240185600,,,

I was expecting it to be like the first one, cartoonish and not very realistic, I was right. In my opinion, gabriel knight 2 is the best of the series only because the personalities of the characters stand out the most in the gabriel knight series. Gabriel knight 2 uses real actors whom gave a great performance, the use of 3d and going back to Tim Curry in GK3 was going down a step. Gk3 is basically Gk1 in polygonal format with a less interesting backset.
I was very dissapointed in the story of this game, in the end after I confirmed the whole story, i said ""nice try"". Nice try as in, 'nice try, but the story just doesn't work out'. One thing that makes the GK series good, is gabriel himself. He was protrayed well in this game, because they used Tim Curry as the voice, as they did in GK1. Another character you play in the game is Grace, very frusterating when it comes turn to play her, the game totally changes from fun and comical to extremely boring. In all fairness though, playing Grace is boring in all 3 games.
So to cut things short the only incentive to play thie game is for the 3d graphics, they are indeed nice eye candy. I recommend playing ""The Longest Journey"", or if you want a taste of the GK series, Gabriel Knight 2 is the way to go.","it is ""OK""",1003622400,,,

Despite ""2"" below, I was able to get to the final boss battle on a weekend (about 14 hours before I quit in disgust, see ""2"" below).  A real Twitcher could complete this in about 5 hours.

WARNING 2.  This game has no way to vary the difficulty and if you are not a Twitcher, this game can be very difficult.  I am nearly 60 and mostly play computer MMORPG's.  This game turned out to be so difficult for me that I quit during the second phase of the final boss battle.  There were segments that were quite difficult for me before that.

If the game was longer and if the user could control the difficulty, I would have given it a 4.  There are very few games I would give a 5.  (Citizen Kabuto for the PC many years ago is one.  Warcraft 2 and its expansion would also qualify.)

Now, was the game fun?  I gave it 4 stars which is the fun factor to me.  There is a huge amount of variety in the game play.

Most of the game is hand to hand combat which works well.

There are a couple of cannon shooting segements that are difficult because there is no decent aiming.  You must use a ""bullet-time"" mode and the Sixaxis capability of the controller to aim the cannon balls to their targets.  You do have a cannonball eye view as your cannonball mostly misses the target until you practice, a lot.

The final boss battle is ridiculously hard which is why I quit the game.

There are jumping puzzles, for which you have to memorize the pattern because when the button shows on the screen, you do not have time to click it. Luckily, when you fail, you go right to the beginning of the puzzle and are ready to start again.

When you do fail sometimes you must endure a long cut scene.  If the scenario is difficult, you see the same scene over and over until you beat the scenario.  All saves are automatic at the end of a segment.

There are some throwing puzzles that are interesting and rather fun once you get the hang of it.  These again use bullet-time and the sixaxis controller to guide them.

Far and away the most fun is when you play Kai, the main character's ward, who is an archer.  Here you have an aiming capability and bullet-time and zoom and the sixaxis capability.  You can literally shoot around walls.  You follow the arrow to its final destination where it hits a foe with a satisfying show of blood.  Even better, one segment, you use flaming arrows to blow up gun powder to kill enemies.  That was insanely fun.  At the end of that segment, there is, oh, I won't spoil it for you, but the high point of the game for me.

The animation is great.  The voice acting is pretty good.  All in all the production values were excellent.  There were no bugs or glitches to hamper gameplay and the framerate seemed fine even with lots of characters on screen.

Sounds are well done.  The music was about perfect.  Whenever you noticed it, it was good and it never interfered with the game play.

The story is adequate.  I mean, super sword, birth right, save the world, been there done that.  It wasn't Arthurian, but it was OK.

If this game was longer and had different difficulty levels, I would highly recommend it.  As it is, I still recommend it as a rental.  As exasperating as some of the segements were, especially the final boss fight, I did enjoy the game as a rental and recommend it even for old spazzes like me.","Fun, but short and best for Twitchers",1247356800,,,

While they've managed to use the Wii-mote Plus better than any other game so far, it still is frustrating to maneuver throughout the game, and I had lost so many hearts and a couple lives because the Wiimote didn't read what I was doing adequately enough.

3.0,True,"03 12, 2010",A29XD1D7HTCRTQ,B001CBW19Y,Joey Pimkowski,"I really wanted to like this game. For one the atmosphere is really cool. The old style western meets futuristic steampunk is pretty neat and the set up for the story is certainly interesting. The whole thing kind of reminded me of an old 80's cartoon called Bravestarr which I thought was awesome when I was eight years old. I also like the alternate history of the civil war where a weapons dealer sells measures and counter measures to both sides extending the length of the war and ultimately rising to power. All this is well and good but the story following a small group of freedom fighters against said arms dealer is very poorly told with a ton of awkward voice acting.
  Really, that's the entire problem with this game, with every good thing it does, it turns around and does like two things wrong. The graphics are good from a technical standpoint, the draw distance and scenery look breathtaking at parts but then the textures look like something running on a PS2. The shooting is lacking and the biggest problem is that the A.I. for your allies and enemies sucks and there's absolutely no cover system which is odd as this game tries real hard to be Gears of war. The jumping mechanics and climbing are all well done with lots of polish so it's really baffling how they screwed up the shooting and drving so much.
  Another strong gripe is that the boss battles are bland, all four of them and two of the fights are with the same girl whose voice acting is awful. Seriously, I think someone on the dev team had their girlfriend read the lines because they went over budget. On that note, this game is full of weird glitches and bugs and the game has random loading sequences that literally stops the game for like ten seconds. In one case they put a loading screen in the middle of a conversation.
  So overall, it's not really terrible, but it sure is sad that this up and coming studio took a great concept for a game and nearly ruins it with lots of stupid problems. I can't really recommend this but if you find it under ten dollars like I did, you can certainly do worse, just make sure you jump in with lowered expectations.

I mean the submission system sucks. When you tap the button to get the guy to submit it goes the opposite way and is hard to get them to submit. The submission system were a lot better in the last games and a lot less hard. I mean it's great that Bret Hart is on the game but I have a hard time getting people to submit as him. It's a hell of a lot easier for the computer to  get you to submit. I also don't like the controls in the Royal Rumble, it was much more easier to eliminate people in the last ones.

  Plus the story mode is a sorta lame too. It was better in the last when you could go on and play as someone else and all the stats and champions were kept the same. In this one it's like all your work in story mode means nothing unless you choose to continue as the same superstar. I  mean if you win the World title as Shelton Benjaman but don't choose to continue as him  then Randy Orton goes back as being World champ and you start all over. I think the Japan Pro Wrestling games had the right idea in their games. You could go for a belt or defend a belt anytime you wanted without a story mode. I've been waiting a long time for a WWE game like that. Plus ok it's cool that Legends like Bret Hart, Mick Foley and The Rock are on it. We don't need Piper, Super Fly or Brutis Beefcake though. If  Undertaker and Kane are on it you should be able to change their costumes to Legend Kane or Taker. Who needs them as legends, it's like a waste of space. They need to keep Bret as one on the next one and have Hogan, Jake the Snake Roberts, Ravishing Rick Rude, Psycho Sid, Stone Cold, and Yokozuna as well. Also you should be able to put Legends into Season mode. Plus if you make someone you should be able to have them in season mode without playing as them. I liked that in the other games. I also liked in the other games how you could play other matches besides your own too. You can't do any of that here and that makes it less fun.

  Also I don't like that there's no tag belts on it or the Cruiserweight title. The game has more wrestlers that were fired than wrestlers that are actually around now too. It needed La Resistance, Eugene, Maven, Tyson Tomko, Luther Reighns, Kenso Sesuki, Orlando Jordan, Heidenreich, the Basham Brothers and many others.

3.0,False,"04 19, 2012",A3HORVSI2I23YR,B001TORSII,Dasbooby,"What made ME1 so great was that it took a great RPG and put it on top of an average skilless shooter (Fire at enemies until you need to A. Reload or B. Recharge shields/health, repeat until enemies are dead.).  ME2 decides to go in the opposite direction and puts an average skilless shooter on top of an average - below average RPG and makes itself just that, average.

  Pros - 2 of the new characters introduced, EDI and Mordin, are both entertaining and are a welcome addition to the series.  Graphics still look nice but I don't really care about graphics that much and they don't affect the score I give games.  Still a big universe to explore and plenty of missions.  The MAKO is thankfully gone and you don't have to transverse giant worlds just to get to some secondary mission objective.  Plenty of background info on species and other such things.  That's really all I can think of.  Now the cons.

  Story/Primary Missions (No spoilers) - There's almost no story in this game which is really a slap to the player's face.  You find out who the Collectors are and why they are collecting people.  That's literally it.  80% of the Primary missions are spent either recruiting new characters or doing their loyalty missions, very few of which are interesting at all.  The final mission gives you some choices that can result in some of your characters possibly dying but unless you're slow, it's pretty easy to figure out who to use.  I had nobody die on my playthrough.  The final boss is laughably easy even on the harder settings.  I often found myself bored during the game because nothing interesting was happening.

  Secondary missions - Most of these are just boring.  In ME1 you had a lot of missions where you'd have to make either a good/bad/neutral choice to resolve a situation.  There's very few missions in this game that require that.  Some of these missions are pointless.  There's actually a mission where you go down to a planet, jog about 120 feet, press 3-4 buttons and the mission is done.  No choices, no enemies, nothing interesting.  There's actually a couple of them like this.  They got rid of the MAKO but then added some stupid new vehicle.  It doesn't control as poorly but its only weapon is an auto-homing missile and it has the weakest armor ever.  This thing takes about 4-5 bullets before it catches on fire and then blows up if another 1-2 hit it.  Anytime you are forced to use this thing, you just want it to end as soon as possible.

  Experience system - There is no experience gained from killing enemies in this game which was just a terrible idea.  There is now no reward for killing enemies other then they're not shooting at you.  All experience comes from completing primary or secondary missions.  Primary missions tend to offer 800-1000 exp for each one complete and you level up every time you hit 1000 exp.  Secondary missions usually offer 125 exp per each one complete though there are some minor ones that offer 40.  My main problem with this is that a lot of these missions are not equal.  You'll go down, destroy 25 enemies, collect some intelligence, maybe do some other stuff and then leave.  Other times you'll go down and do the 3 button mission I mentioned earlier and get the same exact amount of experience.  How the heck are these missions equal in value?  One where my life was in danger and enemies were killed is equal to pressing a couple buttons?  This makes no sense.  They just wanted a standard so they didn't actually have to work too deeply on figuring it all out.  You also get no health or anything from leveling, all you get is 2 skill points that you can toss into your characters now more limited skill tree.

  Inventory system - It's gone.  All they needed to do to fix it from ME1 was sort it by weapon/armor/misc and stack multiples but instead they just decided to get rid of it.  Now you eventually find 1-2 weapons for each weapon type that just have different effects then the other ones (better accuracy, slower fire rate, more damage but less ammo).  The problem is they don't even bother showing you the stats on any of them.  Some of them you can't even tell if you're doing more damage or what the heck the point of equipping it was.  Some are obvious such as pistols or the SMGs, but I couldn't tell what the difference was between shotguns or assault rifles.  Then throughout the game you find damage upgrades for 10% or something like that but once again you can't even really tell if it does anything because they don't bother showing you any stats.  Armor works the same way, you purchase something from the store and it all goes into one area where you can change it.  Most of them are nearly pointless as the suit you get from the DLC that came with the game is better until almost the end.  I didn't even bother changing out of it and it's not even really that good.

  Characters - The characters in ME1 were interesting, the characters in this one are mostly lemons.  The two best characters in this game are the two you get from the first one, Tali and Garrus.  Mordin and EDI were good additions but after that everyone else is meh to terrible.  Miranda could have been alright but I get tired of listening to her whine about how she was given good looks, intelligence and biotic powers.  Gee, what a terrible fate.  Jacob is alright but there's just nothing interesting about him.  Thane I liked at first but then he kept doing some stupid flashback memory thing and just became annoying.  Just die already.  Grunt is by far the worst character in the game and a terrible replacement for Wrex.  Samara likewise isn't really interesting, in fact, her code is kind of stupid considering she will murder innocent people just because it demands it.  Legion could have been interesting but then you realize he's just the Borg from star trek.  Finally there's Jack.  Yeah I get it, bad things happened to you as a child.  Here's an interesting concept, get over it and stop acting like a ..... to everyone.  You can stay down at the bottom of the ship for all I care.

  Gameplay - I see some people saying this plays better then the first but I just don't see it.  I found most of the changes to be annoying.  Your teammates have two settings, charge in and take cover while still leaving themselves exposed to 2-3 enemies or stand right next to an enemy and blast it out until one of them dies.  You constantly have to baby sit these freaks.  In ME1, my guys never really died unless there was an ambush or a boss/mini-boss.  In this game, they die constantly.  They also got rid of grenades for some reason which I hated.  It was nice every once in a while to toss one out and kill some clustered enemies or blow one up on someone who was coming towards you while you were re-charging your shields.  They are replaced by heavy weapons which aren't really that great.  I just stuck with the rocket launcher the whole game as I felt the others were pretty useless.  They also added ammo in this game for some reason which basically just replaces your weapon overheating from the first one.  I can't figure out why as you'll never run out of ammo.  You might run out in one gun but the pistol, assault rifle and SMG all work basically the same way and do the same damage.  As long as you have ammo in one of those, you'll be fine.  You'll never run out of ammo in all three.  Guns are now more accurate and only rely on your aiming.  This is really the only good improvement, although I didn't mind the way guns worked in the first one.

  They also made an annoying change to Shepherd as he can now get hit by an enemy rocket or something and then he stumbles around for like 3-5 seconds while you're getting blasted.  This lasts just long enough for him to get hit by another one so he can repeat his 3-5 second dance until you die.  They added a cover system which I just found frustrating.  Trying to run somewhere and accidentally touch a wall?  Well, now you're stuck to it out in the open while enemies blast you.  I often accidentally hopped over cover while trying to get behind it and often Shepherd would just stand up for some reason while I was behind cover.  Another thing is that they actually got rid of Shepherd's ability to sprint during battle.  Did he get fat or something?  I heard that one of the 6 classes you can play actually lets you do this if you put skill points in it but why should I need skill points just to run, that's retarded.  Especially considering you could sprint with every class in the first game, why can't I do it in this one?  Another annoying problem is that they didn't bother adding a run for outside of battle.  You can lightly jog but this is way to slow.  It takes forever to get around your ship or random towns.  How did they not fix this from the first one?

  Interface - In ME1 there was a nice interface where you could always see the health and shields of you and your teammates.  For some reason they completely got rid of this.  Now you can only see either your health or your shields.  This can be annoying if you got hurt and used an ability that automatically recharged your shields as they show you your shield status but now you can't see how much actual health you have left.  I have no idea what is going on with the teammates stuff.  They put their pictures down there at the bottom center and next to them is some kind of pie chart or something.  I don't have any idea what any of it means other then if it turns red they are taking damage and if they're faded out that they've died.  80% of the time I didn't even know they were dead until I watched them get back up from the ground after the battle.  What the heck was wrong with the original interface?  Why this nonsensical garbage that they put in this one?

  Galaxy map - Oh, where to begin.  You drive your ship around in this one between galaxies instead of just being able to select them.  This eats up fuel, which you get very little of but it's so cheap that you'll never not be able to buy more.  You just have to waste time driving back to the main hub of the galaxy to buy it.  This was just a stupid addition as were the probes.  You use probes now in some stupid mini-game to get resources from planets.  The problem is that you can only hold 30 of them and you'll use 8-12 per planet.  This means every 3 planets you visit, you'll have to drive back to the main galaxy hub to go buy more probes (which are also so cheap you'll never not be able to buy them) and fuel.  This gets old really fast.  Later on you get the ability to hold 60 probes but by that point you're probably done ever using anymore probes again.  I wouldn't have minded it so much if they just let me hold 10000 units of fuel and let me buy 500 probes but no, they had to be annoying stupid with this idea.

  Enemies - The enemies in this game are very boring.  You'll fight the same things over and over again.  This happens in most games but it's just very bothersome in this as they give you no exp or reward for killing them.  Almost every human/alien enemy works the same way.  In the first ME, the Krogans were actually tough and could mess you up real quick.  They turned them into a joke in this one, I don't know that they ever even hurt me.  The only real different enemies are the husks and the super annoying Scion.  The Scion throws shockwaves at you every 3-5 seconds and these will hit you even behind cover and do massive damage.  Your teammates will almost always die whenever you encounter one of these.  The worst part is that they don't even have to hit you to damage you.  I dodged out of the way of a shock wave while walking backwards, watched it pass about 10 feet in front of me and I still took a boatload of damage.  How can I get hurt by something that completely missed me?  They're not really hard, they're just annoying because of this and they have a crap ton of armor.  Then there's the main bad guy who randomly teleports into enemies bodies throughout the game.  An interesting idea at first but then he does it a million times.  All it really does is make that enemy really slow but much stronger.  He's not hard at all to kill and once he dies, if you don't kill the rest of the enemies fast enough, he'll just jump into another enemy to annoy you some more.

  Glitches - Expect and be ready for them.  I only encountered 2 that I can remember.  One was on a secondary mission where I just started floating in the air but could only walk about 3 feet in each direction and couldn't get back down so I had to reload my game.  Another was during a boss fight during Miranda's loyalty mission.  I guess I killed the boss too fast and because of that, some enemy who spawned behind the door I needed to go through couldn't get out.  Because there was still an enemy left I was still technically in battle during which you can't open any doors.  Thankfully I was able to randomly blast at the door and took half her life.  Then I couldn't hit her for another 3 minutes or so before I was finally able to kill her which ended battle so I could open the door and continue the game.

Paragon/Renegade system - Not to much to complain about here, you really don't use them all that often to any interesting effect.  The game claims that going the renegade route makes your character seem like a bada.. but really all it does is make your character look like a giant douche.

  I'm sure there are other things but I was very disappointed because this game just wasn't good.  I was almost consistently bored throughout the whole ordeal.  I beat it just to finish it.  I couldn't believe the complete lack of story, the destruction of any sort of inventory system, the terrible experience system, the lame characters.  There's nothing really new or interesting other then maybe your side characters dying but I've played plenty of games where that's possible.  Some people loved this game, I just can't see why.  Didn't even bother doing a second playthrough.  This game isn't terrible, it's just not good.  This game was so bad that I'm not even going to bother playing the third one which is a shame because the first game was so good and had so much potential to turn into a great series.",Mass Disappointment,1334793600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

- When at long last, an hour into the game, you do get to use the full capabilities of the jetpack, it is exhilaratingly fun.
- It's a comic book story and it's fun to follow along.
- You get more out of the game if you are more adventurous in how you fight the enemies.
- There is considerable gameplay mechanic imbedded in the game such as pulling enemies off ledges, various cover around obstacles, sniping enemies, meleeing enemies, controlling turrets, quicktime combats against enemies, controlling enemy vehicles.
- Worlds are nicely three dimensional to give you a reason to use the jetpack.

Cons:
- There is a considerable lack in enemy variety.
- The game can feel repetitive unless you liven it up with your own antics.
- Far too easy to accidentally crash into an obstacle with the jet pack on and killing yourself.
- Camera control can be challenging when you are scaling ledges.
- WAY TOO SHORT with an anticlimactic ending. It's as if they just ran out of money or time. Or there was some kind of corporate decision to cut it off and release the rest as downloadable content.

On the whole the critics are far too harsh on this game. The game grows on you the better you are at adventurous combat. For example, yes you can shoot the enemies on the ground behind cover.

I had really been looking forward to playing a game that's focused around one of my favorite characters when I got the recommendation from a friend. However, I expected to much out of the game. Some of the levels in the game were terribly TOO long, being that there were 18 of them. I personally think that there should be twice as many shorter levels instead of 18 long levels. Plus, some of the levels were WAY too hard and nearly impossible to beat. I had to use a cheat code to get through the last few levels. NOTE: The cheat code to get to the last level is JANGOISBADDEST. This way, the game is much easeir if you get stuck on a level.

It's not so much that this is a bad game by any means, but rather that it's not the type of ""Giant open-world MMORPG"" or anything else that it's been promoted as.  At best, this game is a 1-3 player co-op shooter game with optional deathmatch mode.  There is no communication between players, very little secret content, small levels, little equipment / loot, next to no story, very unimaginative characters / plot / weapons and very linear character customization.  RPGs and Shooters are about the only 2 types of games I play and in no way will this game make any RPG player happy.  For a game with a supposed $500 million dollar budget, I can't help but wonder where that money went, because it definitely didn't end up in this game.

The lack of day 1 reviews on this game I believe have nothing to do with the fact that this game is so huge (it isn't) or that you need players for it to work (you don't) but rather that the developers know this game is going to get hammered in the ratings and want their pre-orders filled first before people flock to gamestop to drop their copy off for $5-$10.  I could literally give you 10 more paragraphs on why this game disappointed me and doesn't live up to a single word it has been promoted with but hopefully you'll take my word for it instead of wasting $60 on a mediocre game that belongs in the bargain bin.","Not much of an MMO, RPG or Epic Blockbuster but a good shooter.",1410307200,75,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Having recently gotten an Xbox 360, I would obviously have to pick up at least one installment of Microsoft's/Bungie's flagship franchise for the line of Xbox consoles. However, is it just me or did I pick up the wrong Halo game to begin with? Despite all that I've heard that was glorifying the series, Halo 3 ODST was not the kind of game I'd thoroughly have fun with, simply because it won't let me do that.

It seems that the Xbox 360 controller was made for first-person shooters, because it is perfectly aligned with the gunplay in this game. That said, I'm a pretty big fan of how the game controls. It is indeed satisfying to blow off a bunch of mutant aliens with various weapons that you can find and use for your own advantage. You can even swap guns with a corpse's, which is especially helpful if you don't have any ammo. Even so, you also have an effective elbow punch attack.

As fun as it is to kill enemies, though, there's only so much of that fun to be had. When you're not fighting a pack of aliens, you're busy wandering around the lonely (yet scenic) environments, and don't be surprised if you end up getting lost. Even worse, most of the game's levels are filled to the brim with empty areas you walk around in, with the clumps of enemies being at certain places. There are some levels that are filled with alien fights, but each level following afterwards is the lonely and dark atmosphere I know I wasn't anticipating.
I understand that the levels featuring the battles were flashbacks of the Rookie's missions, but I don't think that means the developers needed to make the dark and lonely levels where he's being nostalgic so BORING....
With this in mind, the entire game can be summed up as ""You walk...and walk...and walk...Oh, and sometimes shoot, but that's probably not too important...""

Then there are the truly fun levels in the game, which sport unique gimmicks such as Warthog driving and Banshee piloting. They are not only remarkably refreshing levels in an otherwise monotonous experience, but the Banshee level has to be my favorite level in the game PERIOD. It is SO much fun to fly the aircraft, and you can even fire at enemies while piloting!

Unfortunately, the game is only half-filled with fun, with the other half being total boredom.

Depending on which difficulty you select, the game is either really easy or way too hard to play, and offers quite a steep learning curve in later levels.  Black delivers on the visual and audio goods in spades, but it's the overall gameplay effects that bring the game down, but it's the fact that EA and Criterion didn't feel the need to inject any online capability into Black at all.  Yes this is a first person shooter, and it doesn't offer any online multiplayer options, go figure.

- When at long last, an hour into the game, you do get to use the full capabilities of the jetpack, it is exhilaratingly fun.
- It's a comic book story and it's fun to follow along.
- You get more out of the game if you are more adventurous in how you fight the enemies.
- There is considerable gameplay mechanic imbedded in the game such as pulling enemies off ledges, various cover around obstacles, sniping enemies, meleeing enemies, controlling turrets, quicktime combats against enemies, controlling enemy vehicles.
- Worlds are nicely three dimensional to give you a reason to use the jetpack.

Cons:
- There is a considerable lack in enemy variety.
- The game can feel repetitive unless you liven it up with your own antics.
- Far too easy to accidentally crash into an obstacle with the jet pack on and killing yourself.
- Camera control can be challenging when you are scaling ledges.

3.0,False,"10 21, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000X25GW2,Lisa Shea,"A game made by Suda 51, the game maker behind the cel-shaded rail shooter Killer 7, No More Heroes reflects its creator's desire to push boundaries and innovate as much as possible. However, does that mean it stacks up as a game by itself?

In No More Heroes, the player takes the role of Travis Touchdown, a 27-year-old fanboy living in a small apartment in California. After obtaining a Beam Katana - essentially a lightsaber - by winning an online auction, Travis decides to become the #1 ranked assassin in the world. The game is divided into two types: Trying to move up the ranks from #11 to #1 by challenging the ranked assassins above you, or working to get enough money to enter an official petition to go after the next assassin.

The assassin challenges are the combat segments. You run through an area fighting various low-level goons before reaching the boss - the ranked assassin. Travis' beam katana is the main weapon in combat. It is swung with the A button, but will strike differently depending on if it is in high stance (the Wii remote held straight up) or low stance (the Wii remote held to the side). The beam saber can also be charged up for a larger attack. Enemies who are injured enough are ""finished off"" by waving the Wii remote in the direction indicated on the screen for a final, bisecting slash. The beam saber has a short battery that is drained by attacking and guarding, and drained even more by a charge attack. Once the battery is dead, neither attacking nor guarding is possible with the beam saber. To charge the battery back up, the Wii remote has to be shaken up and down to ""get the juices flowing again"". Besides his saber, Travis also has an array of unarmed attacks, including punches, kicks, and throws, that can be done without draining the sword's battery. The fighting in the game is fun and decent, with some innovative uses of the Wii remote - it really feels like they're trying to make the Wii remote a part of the fighting and not just a gimmick. However, in terms of gameplay, it's overshadowed by more pure-action games like Ninja Gaiden. On its own, though, it's reasonably fun.

The money-gathering parts of the game are significantly less fun. Later in the game, Travis can use his reputation as an assassin to take assassination jobs (which are combat segments), but for the early parts of the game Travis will have to take regular part-time jobs. Everything from mowing lawns to collecting garbage to sweeping for mines is included in this part. They're essentially mini-games; there's only a few of them (nine total), but you have to keep doing them to earn more and more money. They're kind of a drag to do over and over, and really, if you can just do a repetitive activity like this in a game, you might as well do it in real life and earn some real money. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was meant to be fun, anyways.

Besides submitting challenges, it's also possible to buy various new items with your money. Travis' entire wardrobe is customizable with new clothing, and in addition he can buy new beam swords to increase his performance. Travis' apartment is the main base of the game; Travis can change options and equipment, as well as simply sit back and enjoy himself by watching tv or playing with his pet cat.

The graphics are a neat cel-shaded style, with lots of blood, but in technical terms it doesn't look great. It looks, to be honest, like a Gamecube game more than anything else. Furthermore, the lighting isn't very good, and shadows tend to obscure way more than they should, so it's hard to see things. Overall, it looks really dated, and this tends to detract from the action sequences. The sound is pretty good in voice acting terms but not great music-wise.

Overall, No More Heroes has some interesting ideas, but the creators' desires to push boundaries ultimately causes the game to be less fun overall. It seems more like an experiment than a real game, and despite some neat innovations with the Wii remote (including some parts where the remote is held to the player's ear and used as a radio), it's really not that fun of a game.",Interesting Ideas but Issues,1224547200,,,

Game play is repetive and can become dull. Shoot, shoot, fly, fly, chute, chute, boom, boom. You get the picture. Nothing interesting here to a seasoned gamer.
Story is not that interesting. I don't really care much about the characters involved in the story. There is really no emotional grasp for the player to actually latch on to anything.
Nothing to look forward to. The whole idea behind getting a game is to look forward to doing something worth wild in the future missions or story. Seems you just continue doing the same s*** over and over again with different weapons, upgrades, vehicles.
Vehicles like motorbikes are a pain to drive. They feel way too sensitive to turning and hitting a small rock has your character flying into a field.
Guns are annoyingly the same. They don't feel different when upgrading.
There is no easy, intermediate or hard difficulty. Not smart to have a lack of this in your game. It can piss off hardcore gamers if it's too easy and push away beginners if it is too hard.

Therefore, I did not pay 60 bucks for it, and barely actually paid the 17.99 price because I already had money into this system I work out.

That being said, I didn't expect this game to be great nor did I feel disappointed whether it was or not. So yes, I was not disappointed as I did not have high hopes (I barely knew what to expect at all actually, since this game was very under-the-radar), but I was in no way in love with this game.

Cons (major, not going to go into every detail)
-DRIVING. My god, it's horrible. Cars just turn into you, drive into you when you've been stopped for a while, and just in general want to wreak havoc on the road. Cops can pull you over, so you pull over. It's a simple speeding ticket, so nothing major, right? Wrong? You step out of the vehicle and the cop car comes at you 60 miles per hour, doesn't stop, and kills you. How annoying.
-Animations. The scenery is fine, but the lips don't even attempt to read out what a person is saying.
-Short. There's a main storyline, some other things to find, and that's it. Not to mention this is a game where other things to ""look for"" are very unrewarding and pointless. it's about 10-12 hours long.
-Shooting. The game is very generic in the shooting department. Point, shoot four times, dead. No zoom, just LT to aim. On a side note, you can hold like 9 guns (most I've had), but probably more. Seriously though, the shooting is very bad.
-Storyline. Both a pro and a con. I like the characters, and certain character-based events. But at the same time I feel like nothing really even happened in the game except for a couple of random ""go do this"" kinda things.

-Graphics. I mentioned animations were bad, but the scenery is very nice. The city looks fantastic. Lighting is very good, cars are detailed, and not to mention the weather is very very realistic looking. Great addition.
-Storyline. I think it's decent, even after what I said. Vito is a cool character, and you start to watch him develop. As far as events, there are major points, but like I said earlier a lot of it is filler and very random.
-Price. It's cheap now, so I'd say it's worth it. But at the same time, it will probably piss you off. If you play it, you'll enjoy it enough. If you skip it, you won't really miss much.

3.0,False,"03 31, 2013",A16WKPOSEGQC3Y,B0050SY9WC,Nanohead,"Someone here described Syndicate as ""generic"".  I can't think of a better description.

Syndicate reminds me of dozens of unremarkable games I've played, that were neither terrible, nor great.  Games like SiN Episodes, Binary Domain, Singularity and Timeshift.  There's a thread of something going on, but its hard to grapple with all the distractions and compromises.  I always wonder why these games got made, when most likely plenty of others most didn't that could have been better.

I never played the original Syndicate games, so I have no point of reference to the original story line.  The whole ""giant mega evil corporation takes over the world and oppresses everyone"" storyline has been told and retold a gazillion times.  And the post modern twist of ""and they put chips in your head to control you"" has been added to plenty of those stories, especially in video games.  And its not just Deus Ex (which I played all three installments several times each).

There's nothing preventing this generic story from being told well, and having it be an exciting and fun game.  But these guys who built Syndicate weren't on their best form here.  While the story is certainly serviceable, the  gameplay is totally meaningless and unremarkable.  There's one new concept here that I haven't seen before, which is the pretty morbid ""suicide"" power, where you make an enemy kill themselves.  Its pretty original (to me at least), but I felt a bit ashamed each time I used it (in a video game shame kinda way!)

Its also one of those tragic games, where you never really know whats going on, and you never know exactly what to do.  It randomly mixes cliche video game styles, such as vent crawling, remote control, time slowing, jumping, smashing, and enemy waves in a somewhat nonsensical blend.  Sometimes, you know exactly what to do.  Other times, you are completely stumped, as there's no real path to take.

The upgrade system is completely borked, as I never really had any idea what was happening (you pull a chip from an enemy's brain and you get a new power).  The skill tree is just bizarre.  And then there's the whole tutorial nonsense that appears every couple of chapters.  You are stuck in a simulator, and you have NO idea what you're supposed to do...so you sit there and try a zillion things till you either give up, or randomly figure it out.  Oh boy!

And finally, there's the insanity of the visual quality.  Like there is none.... Bloom and blur like you've never seen before.  It destroyed what was left of my middle aged eyes.  I could only play if for short bits of time, and I even hacked the .CFG file to try and get the visuals to be less harsh, but to no avail.  I can't believe that in the age of $100 1080p displays, that the guys at Starbreeze couldn't have at least gotten the darn graphical display quality to be solid.  What a waste.

On the good side, the voice acting is terrific, especially the venerable Brian Cox, who plays the generic and cliched CEO.  And there are other competent actors as well, that I'm sure showed up to the recording studio, read their lines, and never played the game. Lucky them.

In conclusion, what a waste.  If each component of this game was 10-15% more thought through and polished, it would have been a solid 4 star game (like the unloved Alpha Protocol).  So much for rebooting the franchise....",Just one of those games...,1364688000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

I did not hate it, and was able to enjoy some of the redeeming qualities of this title, but as soon I started to enjoy myself, the game would interrupt that with something annoying.  Here are my thoughts on the overall quality of this game.

Graphics:  This is the first thing that anyone will notice.  Simply put, this game is an Anime come to life.  Almost every scene when inside a town or a dungeon looks likely a beautiful cell shaded work of art.  The main characters, NPCs, monsters, and the background scenery is so well modeled and perfectly lit, when the actually hand animated cut scene movies kick in, the graphic quality actually goes down.  The over world is not drawn quite as well as the scenes in the town or in a dungeon, but it's still quite pretty.  The only complain about the graphics is the battle scenes.  The get to be a little too hectic and effect heavy in my opinion.

Sound:  The sound design is passable, the music seems soothing but generic, and not too many sound effects to hear.  The voice acting is pretty good for Yuri, not bad for Rita, Raven, and Estell, and pretty annoying for Karol, and sometimes Judith.  The NPCs are a hit and miss.  I also notice that some scenes were silent with just text, while others were fully voice acted.  No idea why that would be.

Gameplay:  The battle system is very deep, but in the end I ended up using only 10% of the functionality.  All of the different types attacks, moves, and skills were rather much to learn, with new things being thrown at you every few minutes the entire first third of the game.  If they had streamlined this to half as complex as it was, we would have lost nothing.  The game was also quite easy at most times, with no need for anything to do but spam physical attacks with Yuri.  A lot of the dungeons near the end also got very repetitive, with unnecessarily maze like construction, not much variety in enemy types, and just constant grind to get to the main boss.  The more interesting ideas were used in the first part of the game rather than the last.  I clocked in about 70 hours by the end of the game.

Story:  This is where the game was the weakest for me.  I felt that there was very little motivation to keep going forward  at times, other than the fact that I wanted get my money's worth out of the game.  The story started out well, but a real menacing villain never emerged.  The cut scenes also felt very pointless at times with no development.  How many times do you have to ask the princess what do you want to do, we know she is always going to chose coming with us and not stay behind.

Too bad they kicked the respect bucket in the end. But first things first.

THE GOOD OLD GAMEPLAY GETS THE CIGAR
Seasoned and new gamers alike will appreciate the simple yet highly enjoyable gameplay. The factions are well balanced and the units perfectly valued. You gather minerals and vespene gas, you build your defenses, you upgrade, you expand, you gather your forces - and you unleash hell. Repeat as needed until satisfied.

STARCRAFT: THE QUICKENING
The game is much faster than the original. Resource gathering, building, researching and expanding all go faster now. This is something that will appeal to most and I for one liked it. It conveys an enjoyable sense of urgency, adding to the immersion. And because the game is richer and deeper, the tension just keeps mounting.

SWARMS!
The game designers either enjoyed STARSHIP TROOPERS one times too many or they are fond of killer bees documentaries. Either way, be prepared to have to deal with a lot of swarming enemies! The plains shall be soaked in Zerg blood leaving you with a thick metallic aftertaste of accomplishment.

SPACE. SPACE IS BEAUTIFUL
Visually this game is GORGEOUS. It looks like C&C4 was supposed to (but failed miserably). The units are detailed in design yet clearly discernible whereas the environments are superbly done (although not that variable). True, I could do with somewhat more realistic graphics but I can see that this could only be done at the expense of clarity when the number of units rises. What needs a bit getting used to is how some of the buildings do not look that different. No complaints about how they look but one can easily confuse them and build the same building twice.

COME FOR THE VESPENE GAS. STAY FOR THE STORY
The story picks up just where SC-BROODWAR left off. Following each mission nicely done videos move the single player story along (no spoilers, not to worry) that, although we are given the illusion of choosing between different paths, apparently they converge towards a predestined end.

DAMN IT JIM, WHERE IS THE REST OF THE GAME?
Why only 3 stars then? Well, in a nutshell: GREED.
Apparently ACTIVISION's influence is not very healthy to customer relations. Together with BLIZZARD they are trying to turn the StarCraft franchise into yet another World of WarCraft phenomenon - and, at the same time, using STARCRAFT II as the vehicle, turn BattleNet into the new STEAM.  Unfortunately this results in a barely palatable product and using your fan-base to advance your corporate ambitions is always tacky.
Although priced even more than a full premium game, this is not a complete STARCRAFT sequel. You would not know this by its price-tag(!) but this is only A...THIRD of the game, the first part of three: you can only play the Terran campaign. The Zerg and the Protoss campaigns will be released independently later (and priced as if they were full games, one could safely bet).
To add insult to injury, one has to keep spending even more money if he wants any ""premium maps"" and ""premium content"" sold only via the BattleNet. Since this is a game that will be played mostly online don't be quick to dismiss this if you have a competitive streak.

OK, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT - BUT THERE IS A HYDRALISK IN THE ROOM, ISN'T THERE?
Much more serious is the NeverLettingGo-OnLineActivation requirement. The game will ask for activation during installation, which also includes signing up to BattleNet (and, yes, this means that even this expensive game never becomes yours to keep). But that is not all: a periodic OnLine confirmation is also required EVERY THIRTY DAYS, FOREVER. You can play offline but no more than a month between re-activating.
Unlike the latest EA and UBISOFT flops (which have an idiotic Always-OnLine requirement), with SC2, after its initial Activation, you CAN play a single player game (campaign and skirmishes) without logging on to BattleNet. Only, to do this you have to log on as a ...""Guest"" (I know, a Guest to your own game and your own computer...). You will be able to save your progress but you cannot tie it to your BattleNet account later, so any progress or accomplishments are lost for your online Account. After your 30 days are up you have to re-activate once more.
That is why a Broadband Internet connection is included in the minimum system requirements. You can decide if this bothers you.

SORRY TO BRING THIS UP BUT SPAWN SEEMS TO BE MISSING FROM MY COPY...
Remember how we could take our original STARCRAFT CD to a gathering of friends, Spawn it on everyone else's PCs and start a LAN party? Now one can play with his friends only through the BattleNet - and the Spawn function has been eliminated! Yes, that means each one of your friends now has to have his own original copy of the game!
The brass at the top conveniently forgets that the ability to Spawn games was the main reason both STARCRAFT and DIABLO acquired such huge fan-bases.
Et tu, BLIZZARD?

This is a good game, one I think we will be enjoying for years - or for as long as BLIZZARD shall allow us to do so. However, I had higher hopes for BLIZZARD's respect to its own customers.

I only ended up with maybe 2 class changes in this game due to the way they changed things. I didn't like the small amount of experience gotten in this game.

1)  The graphics are Playstation 2 quality...and that's being nice.  I understand the Wii isn't a graphics powerhouse like the 360 or PS3, but after playing Super Mario Galaxy and seeing screenshots of Super Smash Brothers, it's obvious that the 2K team on this project dropped the ball.

2)  Hitting is insanely difficult.  I have played seven exhibition games now and am having a rather difficult time with it.

3)  No online multiplayer.  I don't get that decision.

4)  No minor leagues.  I've checked and can't find it...although the box has the official minor league sticker on the case.  Not really a big deal in my opinion.

There are some good points to the game...

1)  The commentators are insanely good.  Actually the best in any sports game that I have played.

2)  The pitching controls are really good.  You choose a type of pitch, then point your remote to where you want the ball to go, then flick your wrist to begin the pitch...a bullseye will appear with red, yellow, and green areas.  You want to get it in the green area.  You use a throwing motion to lock in that bullseye location.

3)  Defense motion is very realistic.  I've had my shortstop dive at a ground ball and then make the throw to first from his knees.  I've had several double play balls that are just crazy realistic.

If you can get over the pathetic graphics and lack of online play, then my guess is that you would really enjoy this game.

3.0,False,"12 16, 2008",A3Q6GL7WQJG5XF,B00175GC4U,Tushster,"Before I begin my review, I never played Smackdown VS Raw until the 2007 release. I then followed up with 2008 and now 2009. From what I've read, the ones before 2007 are the better ones, but I'll be writing my review based on the ones I've played personally.

I'd like to start off by saying I'm quite disappointed in THQ. It seems players who've played SVR07 and SVR08 have submitted feedback about what they'd like to see changed in future releases, but THQ didn't incorporate much from what the customers suggested into 09.

Gameplay feels exactly the same as it did in SVR08. I don't think I've noticed anything different about it. The moves are pretty much the same, all the hotspots are the same, with no new hotspots added. In fact, they removed a few now that you can no longer take the fight into the crowd. During the bout, player animations are exactly the same as in SVR08. When I put the disc into my Xbox 360 and launched the game for the first time, my first reaction was ""I've totally played this game before.""

THQ did focus on tag-teams in this game, which is pretty fun if you're playing with a friend. If you're playing with CPU, expect them to be as stupid (or even worse) than they were in the previous games. If you're playing in a normal tag, the person standing at the ropes isn't completely useless. The person controlling that superstar can move him/her around the ring, grab the legal opponent in the ring, distract the referee, and perform a blind-tag with the legal partner. They also added the feature of a ""hot-tag."" If your friend is getting manhandled around the ring, and you want in to rescue him (legally), you can pump up the crowd, and your partner can perform a hot-tag with you. What this does is when you get tagged in, you quickly press a button combination (you'll see prompts on your screen). If done correctly, you'll knock down the legal opponent, as well as their partner on the ropes, and you'll gain full momentum allowing you to perform a finisher on your opponent. This is cool because since you also knocked down their partner, you can likely go for the pin because they'll still be on the ground outside the ring. As I mentioned, it's only fun with a friend. If you're trying to do a hot-tag with CPU, they will probably not do the hot tag, but just tag you in normally. Unfortunately, a hot tag can only be performed once per team in a tag match, so basically use it at the right time and make sure you follow the prompts, because if you don't do it right, your momentum will completely diminish.

The entrances seem to look a little better in this release. The lighting and character textures look far more realistic. The crowd has also been slightly improved. The best thing is, most of the crowd is new. They didn't reuse audience members like they did from SVR07 to SVR08.

Another feature of this game I like is ""Road To Wrestlemania."" There are (unfortunately) only few pre-selected superstars who you can pick from, and complete a short-but-sweet storyline with, and take them to Wrestlemania. The storylines are (in my opinion) a little entertaining, and quite cheesy (just like they are in the actual WWE) but that's the fun of it. During the process of finishing their stories, you have opportunities at bonuses, and when you complete that certain task, you will unlock something new to be used during exhibition gameplay. Like I mentioned, the characters are pre-selected, and I was a little disappointed at the selection. I think they could've picked better superstars to complete this mode with. This is definitely a HUGE improvement from General Manager Mode from the previous installments. Those, I just found way to frustrating and long!

They also have a feature called ""Career Mode."" Here, you can basically ""train"" a created superstar and help him/her obtain abilities. You follow certain paths, earn the titles and get points based on how you do in your matches. For example, if you start a match, grab a chair and start hammering away on your opponent, your Hardcore points will skyrocket. It's a neat feature, but it quickly got boring for me. If you notice, I also said ""her"" earlier. That's right. You can train a created Diva in Career Mode. She will first start by going after the Women's Championship. Once she earns that, she can contend for the other championships as well. Unfortunately, Divas can't be used in any other match types, other than the ones they could already participate in (single, tag, battle royal).

THQ also incorporated a new feature called Create-A-Finisher mode. Here, you can (hence the name) create your own finisher and assign it to any character. At first, I thought this would be pretty awesome. But when I tried it out, I was greatly disappointed. You can assign up to 10 mini-moves to complete your finisher. However, the more mini-moves you assign, the far limited the list of available remaining moves becomes. So if you're looking into creating a deadly 10-move finisher, chances are, you won't be able to create what you're thinking of.

The character selection in this game is far better than it was in the previous games. There are plenty of superstars to pick from. I was really happy they finally decided to add Brian Kendrick and Paul London, after many fans were disappointed they were left out of last year's release.

There's this feature called Highlight Reel Editor, or something like that. I thought this would be pretty cool too. I was expecting maybe you can create a mash-up of different replays during your matches and customize an entrance video for your superstar. But nope, not even close. You can just upload your replays to Xbox Live for fans from around the world to see how you manhandle your opponents. Nothing too exciting there.

A couple new things THQ also added: the infamous Inferno Match as well as the Tribute To The Troops arena. It's an outdoor arena, and everyone in the crowd is a soldier.

One thing I really hope for is Downloadable Content. I don't care if it's a roster update, more costumes, or even match-types. I just hope they allow players to gain access to more things that weren't included in the original release.

Overall, this game (aside from the new things THQ added) is the same as SVR08. The new additions aren't that exciting; they could've done a lot better with the new features. The only reason I bought it was because I'm a huge wrestling fan, and my collection would be incomplete without it. If you're sitting on the fence debating whether you want to buy it or not, I can either recommend renting it first, and see whether you like it, or wait until the price drops. I honestly don't think I should've paid the full retail price for this game.

Sound- The sound is ok but nothing special to write home about. That is unfortunate because the soundtrack once had tremendous appeal to me. The sound could have done with a slight touch up or makeover. I guess that would explain that $20 when I bought this new at the store not long ago.

Play controls- This may look and sound like Samurai Shodown for arcade but it handles as badly as the snes. I thought using a ps2 conrtoller would be handle like butter. More like handles like butt. The problem is not that this was a Neo Geo rehash, but rather a remake of these games after they were released on Sega CD or PSX.

This game, is better than Madden 13, which isn't saying much as it wasn't that great.  But, it's fun nonetheless with the caveat you have to grit your teeth sometimes at it's oddities...

I bought the game on release day and have played nearly 1 year through My Connected Franchise (Single Player) and about a dozen multiplayer games.  Needless to say, I'm waiting for a patch!!  First off, the menus are painfully slow.  No, not loading time, I can accept that.  Just clicking through the different options at the home screen, in game, stats, franchise, all seem to drag.  This has been one of my grips of Madden since the PS2 days and it's as bad as ever.

2nd reason for the patch, OT is wrong!!  I tied my buddy at the end of 4Q going into to OT.  The announcers then explained the new(er) rules for OT for which seemed like forever.  So, OT starts and my buddy has a painfully time eating drive and I stop him at the 2.  He decides to kick the FG and hopes his D will stop me.  Instead, what happens...?  He nails the FG and boom, game over; congrats, he wins.  WHAT!!???!!!  C'mon guys.

Given, I didn't buy (or even play) Madden 25 so I would say it's a coin flip purchase this year.  It's nothing great, and it's not horrible either.

That perked my interest so I read some previews about the game which said it was very deep in exploration, item gathering and crafting.  I found that to be fairly misleading.  The only craftable items you will gather are plants and animal skins.  That's it.  Plants can be combined to make syringes of various effects such as health restoration, being able to see enemies through walls, resistance to fire, increased damage, etc.  The animal skins are combined to unlock certain perks like the ability to carry more weapons, carry more ammo, carry more loot, carry more money, carry more syringes and carry more grenades.

The only other items you can pick up are enemies' weapons, which are almost always worse than what you're already carrying, and loot, which you can sell for money.  So while yes it's a little deeper than a straight forward shooter, the ""Skyrim with Guns"" label does a disservice to Skyrim.  This game is still a shooter, it merely has a couple of extra perks.

The enemies also lack in variety.  Outside of one instance which I won't spoil, you'll only ever battle humans and animals.  I'm not sure what else they could have done to provide more variety while keeping the realistic setting, but shooting the same group of tribesman over and over becomes a bit boring, and once you have upgraded all of your gear there's no reason to hunt animals anymore outside of selling their skins, which is less profitable than simply looking for loot.

There are a couple of other features that attempt to break up the monotony such as a knife throwing mini game, poker, a ""pass through all the check points in time"" race on ATV's or vehicles, and climbing radio towers which will open up portions of the map and display their loot locations and topography, much like the Assassin's Creed series.  You can also hang glide around the islands which is fairly fun the first few times, but they never really work it in as a mandatory thing for any missions, such as hang gliding into an otherwise impenetrable enemy fortress to raise hell.  I kept expecting that to happen and it never did, it's merely a tacked on feature that serves no real purpose other than taking in the sights and traveling a little faster if you're headed downhill.

The guns in the game feel good to shoot but nothing mind blowing about them.  Pistols, SMG's, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, LMG's, Sniper Rifles, bow and arrows, a flame thrower, an RPG and a grenade launcher will be at your disposal, as well as a melee knife.  There are a handful of different guns per category, each of which has different levels of customization such as adding a silencer, extended magazine, scopes, etc.  You can also add a paint job to most guns which shows up on the in-game skin.

Leveling up through gaining experience will allow you to unlock perks such as the ability to silently take down enemies from above or below with your knife, silently take down multiple enemies with your knife, reload faster, switch weapons faster, hold your breath longer under water, drag enemies' bodies, acquire more loot, etc.

The story line is a bit unbelievable, you seem to be a spoiled rich kid on vacation in the tropics who gets abducted by the local warlord.  You somehow escape and then it's your mission to free your friends and exact vengeance on the warlord.  The problem is that the whiny rich kid instantly knows how to handle all of these weapons like a pro despite no combat experience.  This is partially explained later on in the story but the main character just never felt believable.  The friends you're trying to save also hardly seem worth saving, from the controlling and bitchy girlfriend to the stoner who doesn't want to leave the island anyway.

In the end the game is still fun and definitely worth playing because it handles the shooter mechanics well and there's enough of an RPG style system in place to make it more than a mindless shooter.  Running and gunning will get you killed quickly so planning out your assault and using some stealth is ideal in most situations and will reward you with more experience as well as keep you alive.

For other Bust-a-Move fans, this is the Puzzle Bobble equivalent to New Super Mario Bros. 2: It's your average bubble-busting puzzler, except made easier and with nothing new added onto it. There are only two modes (Puzzle and Challenge) in the game, and only one of which with a decent length.

Puzzle Mode is spread out in eight worlds, with ten rounds in each. Each round is a hurdle of multicolored bubbles that you must pop to move on. Some of you are familiar with this, right? Well, you're partially in luck: Nothing's different about it! However, by partially, I mean that the Guideline is ALWAYS ON. You know - The long line coming from the cannon so you know precisely where to place your new bubbles? You can't turn that off. It will always be there for you to pinpoint where to make your bubble chains. This is either a sign of relief or a miserable dumbing down of difficulty.

Challenge Mode doesn't fare too well, either. There's only three time limits (Well, the last one being ""Nonstop!""), and you just keep popping the bubble chains until the time runs out or if you lose. Only in this mode can you disable the Guideline for the challenge you expect from this series, but even then, the experience is incredibly short-lived.

All things considered, Bust-a-Move Universe isn't really that bad of a game.

I get it, these environments are MASSIVE but when the first Assassin's Creed was released, the player interaction with the environment was flawless and I cannot remember any glitches, AC 2 was more-or-less the same but then brotherhood and revelations seemed to be riddled with glitches where your character is designed to do y action based on x input and it's just wouldn't execute as intended.  Now with AC 3 I find several glitches, I mean, what's the point of wanted posters you can't tear down to reduce your wanted level?  And even better, nearly all the wanted posters have guards nearby, so if you're at the highest wanted level, unless you just want to flee, it's nearly impossible to just fight off a few waves of guards and then find the nearest wanted poster/crier to reduce your wanted level.  I have literally fought probably a hundred guards non-stop at the highest wanted level...they just keep coming at you, bodies are everywhere, which is kinda cool in its own rite but but it gets redundant and completely counter productive.

I like the story and the different aspects told from the various players involved, they're starting to tell the aspect of the mason (vs templar relationship--which I find interesting).  But honestly, the glitches where Conner will just NOT do what he's intended to do no matter how many button presses or joystick movements you repeat is a serious slap in the face.  It is just plain sloppy programming.  I wanna call the dynamic a piece of s***e.  That's all that comes to mind with the player control.

3.0,False,"03 24, 2013",A3DGCNADDUMFUL,B00005BW7Q,ZeeZee,"There comes a time in console gaming when we are between generations, waiting for the next hardware to arrive so that new games can be released along with it.  There currently are a limited number of new games in the pipeline for the current consoles, as developers focus resources on games that will probably be released next year.  I check daily for news of a new Tri-Ace or Mistwalker game, with no news.  This can be a good thing, however, as it gives us a chance to go back and play some of the games from the previous generation(s).  As a result, my PS2 has been pulled from the closet and placed next to the 360 and Wii.  I decided that it was a good time to pick up this trilogy.  It may seem pointless to review a game that is 11 years old, but the portable gaming systems and PSN / XBOX Live / Wii Virtual Console have given new life to old games.  Old games are often regarded as being among the best, and many of them are ""new"" to younger gamers that never got to play them when they were originally released.

Xenosaga was one of those games that I had always considered playing.  I am a big fan of Xenogears, and I was blown away by the hype for this game when it was announced around 2001 or so.  But after seeing its direction and witnessing it first-hand, at a friend's house, I decided that there were many other games that I should play instead.  I've had 11 years to attempt to curb my initial disappointments with the game.  I haven't decided if it's allowed me to warm up to the title or it's strengthened my disappointments.  I consider myself to be a veteran of console RPGs, as I've been playing them for at least 24 years now, across all manner of consoles.  I still have my original NES Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy carts, as well as many SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx 16 games.  I love console RPGs and I've played games from virtually every major series at some point.

And that's why I have a problem with Xenosaga.  It is apparent that it excels at absolutely nothing when compared to the rest of the games out there.  Positive reviews on this game seem to merely be from apologists that want to hold this game in the same high regard as Xenogears, or maybe even gamers that prefer to watch anime over playing an engaging or challenging games.

One of my biggest complaints is the audio.  The audio is simply a disaster.  I've come to the conclusion that Mitsuda simply doesn't want to work anymore, on anything.  Once one of my favorite composers, he puts so little effort into his music these days that you could just as easily insert any third-rate composer into a game and have it turn out all the same.  There might be approximately three main tracks throughout the whole game.  More often than not, however, the game is completely silent.  The dungeon and battle music are so annoying an uninspired, which is a shame because you will be listening to them for countless hours.  This is one of the first times where I've ever played a game with the volume turned down so that I could listen to my own music collection while playing the game.  Only when you get to the final area are you actually treated with good music.  The final boss battle and ending music are indeed good, but it's not worth playing for 40 hours to finally get to this.  The same man that created the awesome music for Xenogears / Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross (another junk game, aside from the soundtrack) offers virtually nothing to game music anymore.

And it isn't even just the music.  The voice acting is pretty disappointing as well.  I know that many people have preferred Shion's voice actor in this game over Episode II, but I simply cannot stand her.  It's not that she is a bad voice actor, but she just seems wrong for the part.  She sounds like a 50-year-old woman playing a character in her 20s because that's exactly what she is.  I would say that the only characters that I really found to be tolerable were Kos-Mos, Jr. and Ziggy.

The battle system is terribly slow and boring.  It's like a watered down version of the Xenogears battle system, but you spend more time watching animations than actually playing.  The progressions between actions are crude and lack any degree of fluidity.  It literally takes 10 seconds to do even the most basic attack because you have to watch charging animations.  To add to this, the AWGS are absolutely useless (I *never* used them except for the parts where you are required to use them) and there is hardly ever any real degree of challenge.  There used to be a time when RPGs offered some real challenge and required actual strategy, but someone decided that this should take a backseat in this game's design.  To give you an idea, I beat the Proto Dora in less than 4 rounds, and it never got a single chance to attack.  I finished the last two bosses on similar terms.  I think that there was only one battle that was remotely challenging, early on, but only because it's the point in the game where it assumes that you've already learned the battle mechanics.  A poor battle system like this is a problem since, while enemies can be seen, most paths are too thin to actually avoid battle.  It's very much a precursor to the disastrous Final Fantasy XIII in almost every respect.  The games are so similar in terms of gameplay, slow battle progression, terrible music, and sterile linear environments, that the resemblance is uncanny (graphics technology aside).  Dungeons literally take hours to complete because you are wandering about fighting enemies on linear paths.  I wouldn't actually mind this if the story was at all captivating, but it simply is not.

You spend approximately 30 hours waiting for something interesting to happen in this game's story.  By the time you get to the end of the game, it seems like it might actually turn around.  Instead, you are left on a cliffhanger for the second game.  There is absolutely nothing in this game that actually develops the series plot or characters.  It's just 35-50 hours of pointless scenarios in 3 hour dungeons.

Menus are poorly designed.  To apply the numerous types of points to your characters, you have to navigate to no less than 4 different menus.  The system lacks any degree of refinement and the point system is needlessly convoluted.  In contrast, a good game would have placed them all into a common menu to apply points to learn skills or enhance stats.  Generally, there is no good reason to apply points to the strength of tech attacks early on, because there is little payoff.  It is, however, good practice to apply points to the tech attack speed, and apply points directly to a character's ether defense and vitality.  But the game does such a poor job of defining which things are useful and which are not, that it is probably easy for some gamers to waste points on things that have very little return (HP) or useless spells.  The vast majority of spells that are useful belong to a sole character, but these can easily be transferred to everyone else, completely negating anything that it unique about the character.  As such, you will probably stick with 3 characters throughout the entire game because the alternative may mean that you are going to spend time grinding for points to get everyone's tech / skill ether points on par with the most-played characters.  There is no incentive to use anyone else.

Visually, the game was dated even by 2002's standards.  Environments are sterile futuristic grey corridors and characters are messy blobs, with PS2's characteristic ""jaggy"" features.  The lack of progressive scan even in 2002 was unforgivable when even the lowly Dreamcast supported it in nearly every game with the VGA box in 1999, as well as the Gamecube with component cables.  And while graphics are not the most important part of an RPG, it's annoying to have to be forced to watch 10-15 second animations for boring attacks.  The only time that these can be skipped is when the game designers ""cheat"" by carefully inserting an MPEG2 video animation into the game.  Kos-Mos' XBUSTER is one such example.

Playing through Takahashi (and Soraya Saga's) games of the past two generations makes me realize something that many people do not consider.  They simply can't do it without Masato Kato and many of the others that were involved in Xenogears and Chrono Trigger.  I am one of very few that also didn't really like Xenoblade, which I felt was artificially inflated with boring fetch-quests in order to create a greater ""perceived value"" for the game.  There simply was very little meat to the plot and the gameplay.  Interestingly enough, I see that Kato was involved in Monolith's Baten Kaitos and I've read that it has superior writing.  However, I have not played it (yet).

To close, it's simply unforgivable to create a 40-hour linear RPG game that does absolutely so little with the plot or gameplay.  This game literally serves no purpose but to introduce you to the next game, which I hear also takes a turn to focus only on a few characters rather than the plot of the actual game.  We'll see how it goes when I begin part II today.  I may be part of a minority that will actually like Episode II better than the first.

This game is literally the ""Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom Menace"" of Takahashi's ambitious Xenogears series and prequels.  And while nobody will officially admit to the connections to Square's properties for legal reasons, all of the basic lore is there.  It may be a ""re-imaging"" of the series, but it contains many of the core plot elements that were relevant for Xenogears; so much so that many of the terminology and the timeline is the same as what was proposed in ""Perfect Works"" and Xenogears.",It is Evident Why I Ignored This For 11 Years.,1364083200,,,

My biggest complaint though and made me give it 3 star was the story! The story was so poorly written. When I got to the end I almost felt sorry for Connor.

The plot was interesting and the realistic graphics and overal environmental design were awesome. I think Pagan Min is somewhere in the Top 5 of favorite bad guys list. And yet..... I still can't say this game was worth the hours put into it.

I was trying to be thorough and do everything right and sneaky from the beginning. After about 1/3 of the way through I started getting bored. It wasn't hard to figure out why. Every single progressive mission is just like the last. Sneak around quietly and kill soldiers. That's it. Every mission. There's no variety in the the content. Sure you can do the side quests but they're completely optional so there were several I didn't bother to touch unless I happened to be in the vicinity. Parachuting, hang gliding, ziplining, wingsuit, dune buggies. There was so much potential to fully utilize these features in the main story missions, yet they don't use them at all. And I don't really want to make this comparison but it felt too much like they were trying to make GTA: South Asian edition, which would've been cool had they offered the same variety in quest objectives. GTA forced you to do certain things and then offered it as a side mission which gives me the option to determine if I liked doing those things and wanted more or just never do it again until the game made me.

For FC4, the side quests felt like an afterthought and some didn't seem to have a place nor a reason for existing. Like the ""drug"" quest line. The character gets high, passes out, and ends up in a dangerous part of the jungle with no weapons or ways to defend himself. They're not only easy to accomplish but leaves me wondering why there are so blasted many of these quests available in game? Why would I want to inconvenience myself and using up meds and syringes for zero payout? You do all these random acid trip quests and get.... nothing in return. Whhhhhhyyyyy? I finished the Fashion Week quest and got some much needed gear however it too lead to a disappointing ending. The world map is full of interesting things to look at, but again, why would any player care?

The first 3 Shangri-la quests were interesting but it started getting ridiculous in the upper levels. The reasons being that the enemies get understandably more challenging but your options for weaponry are limited to a bow and the ""upgrades"" don't do anything worth while. The demons become more concentrated and take more than 2 hits to kill and you're stressed trying to turn a bow and arrow into an Uzi. After dying repeatedly trying to be sneaky in the 4th section I finally just got frustrated and ran up all flights of stairs spamming my heal button then tapped the bell to finish the level.

The driving mechanics are TERRIBLE. Ajay must be short because he can't see over the hood of any vehicle which means falling off many unseen cliffs. The radio broadcasts are VERY LIMITED and there's no feature to turn it off permanently. You turn it off, get out of the car, get in the car, and it's back on. No matter what. The jokes are funny the first few times but then you just get sick of hearing it over and over and over and over and over again. No matter which side you choose the story doesn't end well and feels unfinished. I went around liberating radio towers and outposts hoping to reduce the number of patrols on the road for exploration but it doesn't help. Looting bodies became pointless because Ajay acquires more cash than he knows what to do with early in game. You're not picking up ammo or weapons, it's all just sell-able garbage taking up space in your bag.

I paid 100 bucks for it and to me, there is just a whole lot better keyboards for gaming on the market. This keyboard has a glossy housing so you can easily see finger prints and smudges and after a while it starts to not look so good.

The keys on this thing are a plus. They are really easy to press and I like typing on it. And the backlit lighting is OK although it's not quite bright enough for me and the space bar isn't lit up. It also has cluster lighting where you can just have your 4 wasd key's lit up for gaming.

It also has buttons for the volume which is really a god send cause you don't have to go clicking on your desktop to set the volume. But my machined scroll wheel for the volume on my Corsair K90 keyboard is 10x's better. The Razor Lycosa also has other buttons for pause, play, FF, RW and others.

Another plus to this keyboard is that if you plug all the wires in the back of your PC, you have a USB 2.0, headphone, and mic jack ALL on the back of the keyboard itself so you don't have to plug anything into the back of your computer. The only bad thing about the wires is they look like they are wrapped in electric tape(it's not that bad) whereas on my new Corsair K90, the cable is braided and looks like cloth.

The main drawback of this keyboard is the looks. I thought it looked cool before I got it but once it was here I regretted my decision. It's not like it looks that bad, it's just that I'd rather it if it wasn't so shiny so it wouldn't have finger prints all over it and look like it's scratched. The main reason why I say it doesn't look good is because there are just way better looking keyboards. There are just too many awesome mechanical keyboards out there for 100$ I don't see why you would choose this one over them. If I'm going to recommend a keyboard I'd recommend the Corsair K90. That's what I have now. And it's absolutely PERFECT. Another keyboard that's better than this is the Razor BlackWidow. Even Cooler Master offers a mechanical keyboard that's better than the Razor Lycosa.

If your a gamer and want a great keyboard and want to be in love with your keyboard, go get you a mechanical gaming keyboard that looks great, and pass this one up.

Let me start my review with some qualifying comments.  Firstly, I am a huge fan of RPGs, and the bulk of my experience is with RPGs, not shooters.  Dirge of Cerberus is a shooter, and I knew that going in, but the draw of getting to play as Vincent (my favorite character from FF7) helped me overcome my hesitation.  So that's why I picked it up.  That being said, please understand that I don't know much about shooters (as I don't have much experience there) and that my opinions will be tempered by this background.  It is entirely possible that someone who plays primarily shooters will have very different critiques.  However, this review will probably be helpful for fans of FF7 and RPGs in general, like me!  Anyway, on to the review.

Graphics (score 9/10): Firstly, the cutscenes are very nice.  They look just like the Advent Children movie to me.  The in-game graphics are slightly less impressive but still fine enough for me.  They look somewhat similar to the graphics in FF10.

Music (score 7/10): The music itself is fairly good.  Nothing jarring or irritating.  However, there's nothing terribly memorable either.  Still, it's pleasant enough.  Plus, the voice acting is excellent.

Characters (score 7/10): Hmm... This is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, Vincent and other characters that were part of Final Fantasy VII are portrayed excellently-- with their proper personalities intact.  On the other hand, new characters (mostly villians) are barely given time to develop (with the exception of Shelke) before they are dismissed from the story.  Also, don't expect to get equal amounts of exposure to all the main FF7 characters--I'll just let you know right now, the only people who get screen time worth mentioning are Vincent (duh!), Yuffie, and Cait Sith.  Why, Red XIII only makes a brief appearance and has no lines.  This was somewhat sad to me as Red XIII is my second favorite character from FF7.  Thankfully, Vincent is my favorite, and we see plenty of him.

Story (score 9/10): The real value of the storyline here is the intimate look into Vincent's past, something which isn't well-explained in the original FF7 game.  These parts are pure gold and worthy of a 9/10 score for the story section.  However, the new parts involving the new villians are rather lackluster.  I think this really is due to the fact that they are given little time to develop as characters.  It's just that the whole story feels a bit generic--some random people are trying to destroy the world again.  After having watched Advent Children (which falls before this chronologically story-wise), I'm just starting to feel a little jaded with the whole ""Shinra's evil experiments"" thing.  However, this game is well worth playing since it gives some illumination on Vincent's past (and those parts are superb).

Battle System (score 7/10): The battle system isn't too bad.  You basically have a gun and you shoot things.  The auto-targeting makes it easier for people like me (who have poor aim).  Overall, I did not find the game overly difficult.  My only complaint here is that there isn't much else to do but shoot things.  The other attacks at your disposal are melee attacks, magic (which you also shoot at enemies), and Limit Breakers (which involves transforming into a monster and fighting with its special attacks).  You won't really use these other things too much though, for various reasons, but mostly because you don't really need to.  On the bright side, you do get different kinds of guns and the ability to customize them, so that using the guns themselves doesn't get too boring.

Gameplay (score 2/10): Speaking of boring, this is where this game falls on its face.  Remember how I mentioned in the intro. that this game wasn't fun?  Well, it's because the gameplay reminds me of the words ""boring"" and ""tedium"".  Everything is so repetitive that it almost hurts.  The only reason I continued was to see the next cutscene. There are several factors that contribute to the boring feel:
1)The environments are bland and not very interactive (and why can I jump over some boxes but not other, identical boxes?!).
2)The levels are very linear and don't really remind you of FF7, even though they are set in the same locations.
3)Most locales consist only of hallways of varying colors. This makes for a dull experience.
4)The enemies are incredibly unvaried.  You'll see mostly soldiers, and they are all similar in their blandness.
5)The final nail in the coffin here is the repetitive chapter system.  Every level uses the same formula--cutscene at the begining, several sections of hallways to shoot things in, and then a boss at the end, followed by a cutscene.  Then the whole thing begins again with the next chapter.

Overall (score 5/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  The terrible gameplay is really what lowers the overall score.  It was a real struggle just to keep playing because the actual gameplay was so un-fun and boring for me.  Ultimately, it was only the story and my love for Vincent that kept me playing this game.  If I had to sum this game up in a single sentence, I'd say: ""Dirge of Cerberus has a great story for the FF7 fan, but (really) boring gameplay"".  I do recommend this game for avid fans of FF7, just because it involves Vincent.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though.  And as for people who've never played FF7 and just want to pick up a shooter game, I suggest you stay away, because I suspect you would find this game dull too.  It's really a pity that Square-Enix didn't do better with this game, there was so much potential here that this game could've been spectacular.  Now, unfortunately, it's become just another bargain-bin game.","This is a great game, except...",1226102400,3,,

Updated after playing several hours of full game...

I have to say that I am enjoying this game in spite of the art style. There are enough other elements which are included that make it fun for an old school RPG gamer. First, there are plenty of customization options as you level up whether you choose melee, range or magic. Second, if you are a completest (the gamer who has to solve every quest and cover all of the map) there is a ton to do with main quests and a variety of secondary and faction quests. On the other hand, if you want to just stick to the main plot and quest lines, you could do that as well. Third, there is enough story, lore, and background information to make it interesting if you like to have a deeper experience. Of course if you are not into that aspect, you could instead hack and slash your way through without worrying about minor story lines.

So, I just wanted to update my review to give credit where I felt credit was due.

3.0,True,"03 9, 2012",ANBCI9WMJS5XB,B0064TYRAU,Keifer H. Yeoman,"Hard to put into the words how disappointed I was with this game's ending. I feel so strongly about it that it has overtaken my ability to meaningfully comment on almost every other aspect of the game. I'll speed through it.

Per usual, the combat isn't innovative for a Shooter (although being able to roll is a nice change) and the controls have interactivity and general response issues from time to time, but lifting ""main powers"" (Slow-Down Time, ""Blinking"" across the map, Invisibility, etc) from other games in genre, and then using them as the centerpieces for the six classes, provides a lot of diversity. I've always enjoyed replaying the games of the series for that reason, but I'm not sure I can endure the disappointment of not being able to alter Shepard's or the galaxy's fate in any significant way.

Music, set design, and cinematography also come through strongly, with the game world really feeling like a galaxy going through a desperate time -- until the final hurdle, where the fight scenes become stratified (can't change them unlike Mass Effect 2) and generic (just lots of bland and confusing action on the screen, think beginning of Episode III in SW Prequel Trilogy).

So now we get to the part I really want to talk about. The game's ending.

SPOILERS:

So aside from the things noted in the above observations, what's wrong with the ending?

Well, first of all, the conclusion of the series is making a split second decision to resolve a tension that was never a central theme of the series -- the inability of Organics and Synthetics to coexist peacefully. Obviously this theme mattered in relations between the Quarians and the Geth, but the Quarians and the Geth were only one part of a larger story, and I was never able to make much of connection between Geth and the Reapers ... because the narrative itself stressed that the Geth and Reapers were too different for there to be much of a comparison between them. In fact, Mass Effect 2 retreated from the idea Reapers are Synthetics at all, instead positing they were a species of Cyborgs. Mass Effect 3 doesn't explicitly backtrack that, but they don't affirm it either, and we seem to return to the Mass Effect 1 idea that Reapers are Synthetics, with the added stipulation (loosely coaxed from Mass Effect 2) that they function as storehouses for organic civilizations. My basic point is that the Reaper's motivations, which have been an awkward specter throughout, are brought to the fore after being a mystery for so long so we can upset the themes that were actually developed and derive a sub-par ending from that. Reminds me of the Matrix trilogy.

Now, despite the fact Shepard is capable of demonstrating that Organics and Synthetics CAN live in peace (very successfully), the ending insists that the differences between the species are too immense, and that some kind of radical transformation is required to do what has already been done. Okay. So basically the ending choices revolve around a moral choice that the game never *really* developed up to, but the tone and setting implies that it HAS, in fact, developed up to, which has confused and sickened long time fans.

So the choice itself a a bad one. The consequences are even worse. All of the real choices of the series, from the relationships you develop to the resources and allies you gather, are completely undermined -- the galactic civilization you came to know and love is destroyed despite all of your efforts to save it. That's right. After 4-5 years, hundreds of dollars, and dozens of hours of playtime, there is no way to save it. Mass Relays get destroyed in all endings (ending galactic civilization as we know and love it), and something (or multiple things) you struggled and put additional effort into to saving is lost for no real reason, be it the Geth/Synthetics, Shepard himself, galactic civilization as a whole, the structural integrity of the human spirit and its innocence, etc...

Choice #1: you can destroy the Reapers, but then you also have to obliterate the Geth and other friendly AI, who it has already been established CAN coexist with Organics and have a just claim to life. I think the development team ought to have taken a glance at this and realized it would have left a bad taste in the Paragon audience's mouth, but there you go. Choice #2: Transform into a wave of energy which propagates a mutation of all beings into Organic-Synthetic hybrids, a nod to the classical science authors who enjoyed writing about huge paradigm shifts in evolution creating dramatically new modes of existence. I will concede this choice has some appeal, but it needed to be handled differently, and in a broader context of choices, as a pricey , ambiguously Utopian solution to the galaxy's problems. Choice #3: Take control of Reapers. The Renegades get the best deal of everyone; all the power they craved is theirs at last. Still, even they probably have issues with the execution.

Shepard HAVING to die/being separated from his friends is an extremely poor way to reward fans. Shepard did die in the introduction to Mass Effect 2, but only to illustrate how unstoppable he/she truly was when he/she came back to life. That was pretty cool. This seems to be the final 'death' though, at least as a being with a personal form and identity, and that should have been reserved as a PUNISHMENT or as a PRICE. Specifically, punish people with death for not completing the multitude of optional objectives, or demand it as a PRICE (like destroying the Arch Demon to be 'true' Grey Warden and destroy the threat once and for all); as I said, choice 2 (which is what I ultimately went with) had a lot of promise as an expensive UTOPIAN solution, but there should have still been an option for Shepard to ride off into the sunset into his 'ordinary' galactic civilization if that's what the player wanted.

I really don't understand the logic of this mediocre ending, especially since they seemed to be actively bending the plot to make it happen, against more natural and rewarding endings. Until the last 15-20 minutes, Mass Effect 3 was a great conclusion in some ways, and at least a comfortable one in others.

I don't see why they were so strongly against providing us with the option for a comfortable ending, when the structure of the RPG always seemed to necessitate that such an option should exist for the players who worked for/desired it.",Ending made me feel sick,1331251200,103,"{'Edition:': ' Digital Deluxe', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

RPG is my favorite genre (along with turn based strategy games) and I picked this game up thinking that it would be good. However, as some other reviewers mentioned the combat is not enjoyable from an RPG fan perspective. It quickly turns into button mashing. I played it for more than 10 hours and barely used any spells (except healing) and had no problems in getting through the battles by just hitting the sword button over and over again. They could have at least added combos to make the combat more interesting but alas. You just need to evade now and then with another push of a button and that's it. I think RPG lovers who enjoy strategizing in battles will find the combat extremely dissatisfying.

Second, there is very little character customization. You can only choose your equipment and spells. There are no skill trees, character classes etc. That's another blow if you are looking for an RPG game.

This game is simply blah. It is a boring, slow-moving game. BTS looks and plays about the same as Warlords, which played about the same as vanilla Civ4. Nothing earth-shattering here.

The game STILL goes out of sync when you play multiplayer. Get a life Sid. Fix the darn MP please. I mean, really, go play Company of Heroes, BF2, even old Risk II, or Monopoly online, and you will not go out of sync...EVER.

The Random Events feature are always (at least for our family) a BAD thing.

The Quests feature has never worked for any family member. It always says we fail a quest, even though we meet the requirements of the quest.

There are only three things which BTS is an improvement on:

1. Spy system is pretty cool, though most things are way too expensive for the spy to do, so you end up doing petty crap like steal the town's treasury, which is usually a pittance.

2. Random Personalities: You can mix and match a leader to the country of your choice.

3. Corporations have their own suite of options, like Civics.

All in all, a rather bland, boring game, no matter how many ways you play it.

Upon release, the multiplayer was just plain unsatisfactory, although the changes they've made as of now really have turned that aspect around. They tried a little too hard to be flashy and really had a lot of gimmicks. The forerunners are just dumb to fight. They have strong weapons, and teleport, but otherwise they just stand still and shoot. Whatever the deal is with their shield system is just annoying and they need to have heads where heads should go, on top of the shoulders, not somewhere near the top of a big hump. The elites roll was basically pointless. The didact was not at all imposing, and the final 'battle?' was just plain disappointing. I didn't get why they would've ended it that way.

So they lose a star for not having a clue with multiplayer when they released it with too few playlists, poorly balanced weapons, lowering the skill gap enormously, etc... And another for what they did with the campaign. I do consider the way spartans play to be an improvement, but the forerunners are lame, and the elites were feeble in comparison with previous titles.

Yes, the game is crazy addictive fun that is fairly well scripted but absolutely preposterous.  The main combat of the game takes place on a puzzle board directly ripped from the Bejewelled mold. To liven up the old formula, fun enemies with different names and abilities fight against you by taking their own turn after yours. You earn experience points and gold during battle that allow you to level up and purchase your own unique abilities and items that help in combat situations.

Like many RPGs where the formula is solid, the programmers lose sight of what makes a game truly great, and like many games that are in the highest echelons of RPGdom this game suffers from a distinct overload of monotany and lack of flow because you constantly need to level up and battle etc...

The best thing about this game is the graphics and the complexity.  The customization of characters is amazing for a vita title, you don't see much of that.  The multitude of weapons, modules, and upgrades you can do will keep you busy for a long time.

However after a while it gets repetitive.  You start noticing that there are not that many enemies, you fight the same ones over and over and over.  The world is also super tiny, your quests will make you run through the same tiny world over 1000 times.  Also the storyline is just standard, nothing special and nothing memorable.  Music is also generic.  You also cannot customize the button layout, which is lame and it takes a long time to get used to.

My biggest gripe though is the aiming system:  target lock for melee sucks, doesn't work for crap except the first hit because you will be going through the enemy and lock will break.  And if you're using a ranged weapon, you can't shoot AND aim at the same time unless you have 2 thumbs, thanks to the inability to configure your buttons.  Also there is a lag when you aim and it always makes me over/undershoot my targets kinda like a s***ty fps game.","bad controls, storyline, and repetitive.",1417305600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation Vita'}",

You can spend all day on one planet gaining new technologies, learning new languages, mining everything...or you can explore your local star system, or gain access to hyperdrive and explorer neighboring star systems and their planets.

My main gripes that prevent this from being a 5-star:

You just don't have nearly enough space to hold things. I spend way too much time transferring materials or getting rid of things to make space. Yes, you can eventually gain access to ships/suits with more space but it's very random if and when it'll happen (or how much it'll cost). You also need too much of a variety of materials to eventually upgrade things or make components.

Finally, I am never really clear the regions I've visited on a planet-- there needs to be a better interface to clearly indicate I've been somewhere before landing the ship and reaching the save marker in that place.

A massive universe with an in depth storyline, real and entertaining characters, engaging dialogue and sidquests, and a breadth that nothing short of incredible. Basically, something not to be missed.

The graphics are gorgeous, though too much is cast in a weird orange glow that swallows almost everything. But the tech nerd will delight in the hologrpahic loading screens, of which there are about 30, the near photorealism of the characters and some long distance visuals.

Audio is perfect, with a combination of old and new voices, some so apropo to character they'll make your skin crawl. Major props to Martin Sheen for the Illusive Man. There is however, a lot of overlap when too many opponents occupy the screen. Also, some voices are oddly placed and distorted, so that you'll be listening to a side conversation that seems to be happening from across the room.

Gameplay is what you'd expect, but also where the most bizarre developments were made. Almost every story mission, all of which contain critical in game items and upgrades, are one play only. So if you miss something, you'll never know, much less be able to go back and get it. Planets that are explorable are now fewer and farther between, and the system to move from planet to planet, despite working well, is now a odd feeling piloting sim.

Health and shields are now totally regenerative, and healing is solely for your squadmates, so there's no longer an ability to heal on the fly, making this more like Gears of War cover to cover combat. Emphasis is now on skills, many of which combine well. XP is radically changed, and no longer dependent on combat. This is rather confusing, and makes leveling hard to visualize, and what gets you experience seems random at time. Skills are also shrunk to 6, removing a fair amount of character customization.

Upgrades and improvements replace the majority of new equipment, which has to be researched. Searching for resources is now a annoying mini-game that feels like one of those old school adventure games where you scoured every pixel of every screen to progress. The new hacking and decryption minigames are fairly nice, and easy to get through, meaning tech personnel are no longer mandatory.

4.0,False,"09 9, 2008",A3J2CSMI57NHIH,B000WCN8IW,Strangelove,"I think this game is a little underrated. While people can dismiss this game as a middle-of-the-road hack & slash, there are some innovations that make it quite entertaining.

First off, the controls are easy and intuitive; the basic moves are strong attack, quick attack, jump and block. There are special attack moves and projectiles that you can purchase. Finishing moves and executions are done by simply pressing the a and/or x button. There's not much to remember, the learning curve is low.

This is an open world type of game, on each map (there are 3 huge maps) there are objectives you need to achieve, such as rescue Viking prisoners, find a key/item, clear out a watch tower etc. After all these 'mini' objectives are met, you then attack the city/fortress on the map. This is the main objective of each map, and these battles are quite spectacular, involving hundreds of friendlies and enemies.

Also, its not a case of simply charging at the enemy to cut them up; some situations require you to sneak up on unwary enemies and slice them in half.

The selling point of the game is the bloody, gory, slow-motion violence. Slicing off heads and hacking off limbs are done in juicy detail and certainly satisfy my blood lust. Both graphics and audio are great. In all, this game is fairly easy and straight forward, and is quite an adventure.",Lovely bloody violence,1220918400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The game had a great story, the voice acting was superb, the graphics incredible...it really felt like (in movie terms) a summer blockbuster type of game.  That said, the game does have some faults.

I think there is entirely way too much shooting action, and not enough climbing/platforming and exploring/puzzle solving (and the puzzles that do show up are way to easy to solve).  Really though, as great and detailed as the levels/chapters are, it got really annoying that every section just ended up in some giant gunfight with the same 4 or 5 enemies...and the game really puts you at a disadvantage when they have numerous enemies coming out of every nook and cranny shooting at you (expect to die a lot in this game - luckily you have unlimited lives, you just respawn at the last check point).  By the time I got to chapter 18 or 19, I was so over with the whole shoot-out aspect, that I just wanted the game to end really.

4.0,False,"09 5, 2011",AY55J49QMLEYA,B00269DX5W,Jason,"Assassins Creed was a beautiful game to behold and the ideas behind it were downright amazing.  However, I never finished it because kept getting me in trouble for moving to fast, random guards would attack me unprovoked.  I quickly grew bored of constantly having to walk when I wanted to run, and the long horse rides between towns bored me to death.

I finally picked up Assassins Creed II and I instantly find myself enjoying it more having really grown fond of the Sandbox-Open World type game.  It allows you to explore multiple cities/towns with quick travel (no long horse rides) between them.  You can pay off or kill people or rip down posters so that you're an ""unwanted"" man, this allows you to run like a video game character instead of walking like you're walking your grandmother around the block in real life.  I understand this game is trying to make you a sneaky, stealthy assassin as opposed to a blundering AK-47 yielding idiot.

Graphics:
The graphics on this game are spectacular, everything looks amazing, from the textured streets of Venice, to the individual character models, to the lighting and shadows of even trees.  Everything in this game looks gorgeous, there's no denying that.

Sound:
The sounds in this game are quite good, they don't distract, the music is lovely and fitting and the city feels organic and alive largely thanks to the sounds and soundtrack.

Story-line:
You learn how Ezio became a deadly assassin as well as this war between the templars and the assassins, I didn't find the storyline as interesting as I hoped, maybe because I was wondering how Desmond fits into everything or why I should really care about templars and assassins.  But that's just me, probably my personal bias and opinion.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is fun, the open worlds, the action-rpg elements are fun and will keep you busy for hours, the missions are somewhat repetitive (especially the side missions).  This game shines when you're kicking butt as an assassin, flawlessly, and effortlessly running across rooftops, assassinating people without a care in the world.  The game bogs down more when you inevitably make a jump you did not intend to, or fall, or find one of the tombs you have to explore via platforming (which is a nice break).  This is because of the system used to control Ezio, you hold R1 down to make him in fight/flight mode and you use x to jump, run faster, swim faster, whatever you're doing...blah, blah, blah...then later on in the game you have to do some mechanics like grab as you climb the building or jump off walls.  This all translates into more button pressing in a control scheme where you have less control over the character's individual movement (because of button overlap-one combination of buttons makes you do everything).  This leads to some extremely frustrating moments where you die needlessly, you fail to get through a timed platforming sequence and want to throw the controller through the TV.  My advice to the developers is to revamp the whole system and take lessons from the inFamous and uncharted games.  However, I must confess, the fighting, the collecting, the assassination systems in this game are almost flawless and I hear they just get better in the series.

In conclusion, if you love open world sandbox gaming with some rpg elements can put up with these frustrations and deal with the control scheme, you'll have a great time. If however you hate needless death and are prone to breaking TVs with your remote, then you perhaps would be better off borrowing or renting this game first to see if it's for you.",Greatly Improved Sequel but is Control Scheme Takes Time to Get Used to.,1315180800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I haven't finished yet; but for what I have played, I have been almost 100% satisfied with the game but like all games, this has a few flaws.

One of the good parts about the game is that the controls are excellent. Neo pulls off some awesomely fantastic moves. The graphics are points are great, but at other points not so great. I agree that they could have been better. The fun factor is great, it is fun. The game is long, I've been playing for a few hours and I'm still on the first movie. The game also follows the movie almost exactly; some parts can be changed if you choose to do things different that what was seen on the movie.

There are some down sides to this game. The camera angles sometimes moves to places where you can't see some of the things that are going on screen. When you die or skip the story, some of the noise is occasionally lost during some battles. The only other big problem I have seen with the game is what Jeffrey S.

Pros: Bluetooth and RF Wifi USB adapter.

This means you can plug in the wireless dongle and enjoy an Xinput controller, or connect it via Bluetooth to an Android or IOS system. I tried unsuccessfully to pair to to a Windows 10 PC through bluetooth, while it pair it showed as a bluetooth keyboard and none of the keys could be set.

Xinput works fine, no lag, and no dead zones (verified with several different programs). That's amazing considering both the official Xbox 360 and XboxOne Controllers have deadzone issues. However, when using my Dolphin emulator, the X Y and B buttons did not respond. They work so far with everything else, just not with Dolphin for some reason.

Paired with Bluetooth to an Nvidia Shield. Worked great. No lag issues that I could determine, which is great for mixing together a bluetooth and RF controller in the hardware.

Controller Build: It is a tad on the light side, but not cheap feeling like a lot of generic Chinese made gamepads. Kind of like the Wii U pro controller in weight, a mid weight, not heavy weight like an XboxOne. The thumbsticks are responsive and center well. The buttons are responsive, and they glow which looks cool. The D pad is a Nintendo style instead of the Playstation kind (thank God). Best thing is the RT and LT triggers are spring type triggers.

Connection quality: Played for a few hours with both the RF and Bluetooth functions and never experienced a disconnect. Unlike the Xbox One wireless adapter, it never disconnected, and connected immediately. The dongle is tiny as well, and marked Gamesir to distinguish it from other dongles.

Cons: Button placement. I would have preferred the START and SELECT buttons be swapped with the Turbo and the Clear, I find myself naturally reach for those two.

Wired Input: Yes, you can play it wired with Xinput if you desire... however the button blink as if they are charging. Still works, but then you have to deal with the buttons constantly blinking as you play. Easier just to stick with the wireless dongle unless need to charge it.

Bluetooth only works in Android: So far as I can tell. I tried but was unable to get it to work with Windows. Why is that a big deal? It's not, really, unless you were playing on a Device like the Microsoft Surface and the one USB port is already being taken up.","Very good controller, almost 5 stars",1454371200,,{'Color:': ' With Bracket'},

4.0,False,"10 30, 2012",A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B0050SWTAQ,Alex,"Graphics: Most Wanted has plenty of pluses and minuses graphically. When I first saw this game for the first time I thought it looked outstanding. Once I got it, I was underwhelmed. It still looks good, but nothing like the videos. Edges of cars and the environment have a choppy appearance, and the city in the distance really looks like a PS1 or PS2/Xbox game. When it comes down to the races, sense of speed, and the cars themselves though, it looks fairly impressive... especially with how the framerate holds up -- for the most part -- when there are a bunch of cops and/or crashes on-screen. The temporary blindness when looking into the sunset or when coming out of a tunnel is also a nice effect. 4/5

Sound: Again, positives and negatives here. First, some positives: The cars sound awesome, especially if you have a pair of headphones for your 360 (Tritton, Turtle Beach, etc.). The way the cars echo in tunnels and in alleyways is great. It's nice to see Criterion add things like that to the game. The soundtrack, I think, is pretty good. It has a nice mix of dubstep and hard rock that only add the experience when in a race. The downside I have with the soundtrack already is that in just about 3 hours of playtime, I have heard some songs 5 times already. I'm not sure how many tracks are in the game, but my assumption is that it isn't many. If you don't like the song list, you can turn it off completely, or use your own playlist. The biggest downfall -- and it's not really a huge one -- with NFS:MW would have to be the police chatter. It's always the same routine ... ""What make and model? What color? We need more cops. These guys aren't messing around. These guys are good."" It's really rather redundant, and it's a shame, because it could have added a lot to the game. 4/5

Fun: My first impression of this game wasn't all that great. I was pretty underwhelmed. The more I explored the city, unlocked cars, completed races, and especially tried out the multiplayer, the more I enjoyed it. While the game only contains 41 cars, there is enough to do with each of them to keep you playing this game -- even on single player -- for quite a decent while. The biggest downfall of this game is probably the single player, surprisingly enough. It's been a lot of fun so far, but after just a few hours of playing the game, I'm almost halfway done with getting all of the Most Wanted cars. I really just wish Criterion/EA added more content to the disc. Thankfully, the multiplayer makes me forgive this lack of single player depth. The challenges in multiplayer are, for the most part, very entertaining. While the online isn't without flaws (They're rather minor things, but you'll pick up on them quite quickly if you decide to hop online), it's definitely entertaining, and playing this game without the Online Pass would take away a LOT of what Most Wanted has to offer. 4.5/5

If you have any interest in racing games, you have to get this game. After zipping through the city and thinking I had seen everything, I explored areas I had no idea existed. Fairhaven is a vast, fun city to race around in, and it's only better with friends or even randoms. It may not be without its problems, and it could use a bit more depth, but this exhilarating, essential sequel to Burnout Paradise makes Need for Speed: Most Wanted a must-buy for adrenaline junkies.

Pros: Multiplayer, variety of Fairhaven's landscapes, varied car list.
Cons: No cops in multiplayer, minor online bugs, 41 cars seems a bit low, short single-player experience.

4.25/5

EDIT 11/1/12: I've only had the game for two days, and while I'm still having fun with the game, I have a feeling it won't last much longer. Without trying to get all of the Most Wanted cars too quickly, I already have 9 of the 12. Not only is it easy to get the Speed Points to unlock the races, it's easy to unlock the cars as well. The city is pretty nice as I said in the original review, but I feel like it could get stale within just a few weeks because I find myself on the same major roads over and over again. The multiplayer is pretty fun, but only for about a half hour at a time. The upgrading the car thing and unlocking things for all of them the more you use them online and off is fun and all, but I'm really thinking this game ought to be about $35, and not $60. Super frantic races and events, but there just isn't enough depth, particularly in the single player.

Zoo Tycoon (Original) is the best out of all of these.  Marine Mania... is cool.  Dinosaur Digs SUCKS.  I think it takes the realisticness out of the game.  Not only that... It costs A LOT of money and just makes you go into the red.  Overall, though, it's a good game because you don't have to put the dinosaur stuff in do you?
Gameplay 8/10
It's simple to build exhibits... and fun.  It's easy to find out how your animals are doing.  Everything is easy and doesn't take much effort.  Like hiring Staff Members or telling them what to do.  It's also cool to watch the marine shows.  One flaw is the crowds.  I needed more bathrooms so I installed them.  The people continued to use the other ones.  Then they get mad when they can't use the bathroom and leave.  The A.I. of the crowds would have to be uhhh 0.

Graphics 7/10
Everything looks realistic.  I wish I could zoom in just one more time to get closer to the animals.  But still, things are good.  Its not great, but good.

You can hear all of the animals and the people talking.  Seems like you're at the zoo instead of looking over it.  Great job herm just not perfect.

4.0,True,"08 7, 2011",AWSXMDDPH6E5N,B000SQ5LQ4,S. O&#039;connor,"I have to say that I had many reservations when I purchased this game. So many reviews kept saying how much it is nothing like the first 3 SC games and that the series pretty much went downhill after Double Agent. But for anyone that is reading this review, keep in mind that people don't like change. This game transcends the series to another new high level. I would highly recommend that you try this game yourself and don't listen to the negatives. Here's why.

Story: If you like anything that is 24, or spy movie action in general like From Paris With Love, then you will definitely love this game. The story makes total sense. For people who are new to the SC series, it throws some info into the history of Sam Fisher, the character that you play, so you understand what's going on. For those that have been faithful to the series since the first SC game, you will totally fall in line just like a newcomer as the story follows from the last games as the others do. There was only one segment of this game that I thought could have been implemented a bit more which involves a chase scene,. but it is still totally intense and you will actually feel the great pacing of the story as well.

Gameplay: THis is why I don't understand why so many people hated this game. The gameplay is still the quality of other SC games with one exception. They made clinging to walls much easier. You automatically do it which helps. You can also fire from behind walls and objects while in crouch. There is also something called the Mark and Execute option. When you take down an enemy using melee combat, you receive an M&E action. What that does is allow you to tag your enemies, and then when you shoot, it is a one shot, and sometimes head shot, kill that takes them out. This adds so much more dynamic to the already flawless stealth action that SC employs. Some have said that it makes the game easier but quite the contrary. YOu can upgrade weapons in the game which will also effect your M&E options as well as some weapons allow you the minimum of 2 bars and others give you as much as 4 or 5 M&E bars which represents the amount of people that you can tag.

And towards the end of the game, your stealth skills are put to the test as they revert back to the stealthy action from previous games. So that means that you have to hide in the shadows before you strike. It is actually done quite well.

Overall: I will say that it is definitely a AAA game and I like what Ubisoft has done. You will also feel closure in the game as well. If they never make anymore SC games, you will still be pleased with the ending. I recommend this game to anyone that either loved MGS4 or others that have played through all of the other SC games. For newcomers, I would say that if you love spy action thrillers, you just can't pass this up.","Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne in One",1312675200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

4.0,False,"10 20, 2005",A5KUZ2OBB73TB,B000AB6044,Wes D,"Age of Empires 2 is my favorite PC game ever (see my review) but I've been anxiously awaiting the release of AOE3 since I read about it a couple months back.

Here's my first take of the game.  I'll post an update in a month or two.

The Collectors edition is very nice; I personally think it's well worth the $20 extra if you're a AOE fan.  A pocket strategy guide is included and provides pretty good information and is enough information for anyone who has played AOE2.  (Saves $20 on the regular strategy guide).  Read above for the other stuff included - but let me say that I think it's a heck of a deal.

My hardware - I play it on a P4 2.5 Ghz, 512 MB ram, ATI Radeon 9200 256MB.  The game loads and plays fine.  This game requires a massive video card to have smooth-scrolling during gameplay, and mine barely cuts it.  If you can live with a little chop, it should play on almost any recent card.  My laptop with Intel Integrated Graphics even plays it just the same without any problems (even though the card is not specifically supported by the game).

About the game - The neatest feature is called ""home city"".  It gives each civ some certain advantages and creates a more challenging gameplay since not only do you have to collect resources for your colony, you also must send resources back home to mommy and daddy.  Sending certain things gets you certain things in return; this is handled through the ""cards"".  I'm not a big fan of the 'card' method because it reeks of Civ and other kiddie RTS games, yet the idea is good.

I've not yet tried any of the campaigns so I will not comment on them, but playing single player has been fun.  The map is much smaller than AOE2, and I have yet to figure out how to change the size without adding more players (if it's possible to do so).  The interface is 3-D and is very similar to Empire Earth and Age of Mythology.  The buildings look very sharp and villagers need to mine silver, food, and wood. (I haven't yet seen stone).

There are lots of different military units; this gives a different dimension to gameplay although some (archers, calvary) are very familiar to AOE2.  Work on gathering resources, building armies and buildings, trade, and barter with Native Americans (a new, interesting feature).  Managing a home city also provides a different dimension that presents it's own challenges.

Comparing AOE3

1. Empire Earth II - I find EE2 overloads me with information.  Just playing the game is almost too much work.  It looks like AOE3 is quite a bit less complex although creating a huge village, fighting strong players, and managing a home city might prove to be a little more ""challenge"" than a casual gamer would like to take on.

2. Rise of Nations - I consider RON to be the real update to AOE2.  It has a very similar look and feel to AOE2.  I find RON to be too much about upgrading civs but if you set up the game to have only 4 civs the gameplay is almost exactly like AOE2 with better units and graphics.

AOE3 is very similar to Age of Mythology in game play.  I was not impressed with that game so after playing AOE3 a while I'll have a better feel for how long it holds my interest.

Complaints - My main complaint about AOE3 is the graphics size.  I love huge screens and small resolutions (1280x1024 or larger) but the game characters seem way too large, like the game is being played in 800x600.  I hope that ES fixes this in a update or future version.  I much prefer the size of the Rise of Nations characters, even if it involves a little less detail.

All in all, my early judgement of the game is that of a winner.  I only give 4 stars though because of the resolution size.  I'm also leery of the 'cards' system for shipping back things to the home city.  If I wanted to play a 'turn-based' game I would have looked elsewhere.  Hence, I'll reserve final judgement until I get to play with the game more.

I would say that anyone looking for a true updated AOE2 should look at Rise of Nations in addition to this game.  I'm probably not alone in saying I would be more than happy to buy another update to AOE2 with more CIVS and a RON graphics look and feel.

4.0,True,"02 16, 2014",A2PQTKJ3S1KW3I,B00GMTKMHY,TwitchForFun,"Edit Review: (I had some more time to think about the game)

My biggest complaint about the game, is the lack of combat. Once I starting to get back into the swing of things, the game ends. It's unfortunate too; because the game dose not give you any reason to replay it , beside trophy hunting (really easy too).

I've beaten the game on normal, hard and survival. I recommend the easy, or normal mode. Only because on any harder difficulty, you hardly get to dive into the combat, as you'll barley have any supplies to fight back with.

In this DLC humans and infected share the screen/level together, so some parts of the game you can watch the humans and infected go at it and they will start killing themselves off. On survival difficultly this is a must, as you really don't get any supplies or ammo to fight back. You'll have to hope you're enemies will do the ""killing"" for you.

As far as the story goes, it okay. It never really gabbed me like the main game. What I did enjoyed about the story was the character development for Ellie. You had a bit more prospective and understanding of her connection to Joe.

Original Review

This DLC Left Behind took me about 2 hours to complete, because of this you're going to get a different and more condense version of The Last Of Us (TLOU).

I would look at this DLC as a chapter and not as a complete story. The game is not as dark as the main game, as it has more lighthearted moments mixed in with it, and less combat.

I wish the game did have more combat. It really is a small part of this DLC.

I really enjoyed the overall message of the game. That we fight for the ones we love, and we don't give up on them, no mater what the world throws at us. It's something that implies to the main game and really just reinforces Joe and Ellie journey and relationship.

The voice acting is a great addition, and the cutscenes and dialogue are very enjoyable. The remade soundtrack sounds great. Whether it sounds better than the original is all about your preference. It is  a bit more difficult than the other FFIV versions(from what i have seen online), so it might require grinding.

I saw a couple of reviews about ""Syberia II"" that got me interested in playing that particular game so of course I picked up ""Syberia"" first.  I do not take the time to play a lot of these games, but when I do I like these sort of adventures where you go around and collect items, endure endless conversations, solve some tricky puzzles, and eventually uncover some sort of mystery.

The heroine here is Kate Walker, a sophisticated New York Attorney who is sent by her firm to Valadilene, a smal alpine village in France, to buy-out an old factory, the Voralberg Toy Company, which was once world famous for making automatons.  Of course once she is there Kate is confronted with an unexpected twist the turns her business trip into a journey heading east in order to get a signature needed to complete the deal.  Kate's journey consists of three additional locations after Valadilene: the university city of Barrockstadt, the forgotten city of Komkolzgrad, and the once lavish seaside resort of Aralbad.  Her only companion, once she gets him up on his feet, is Oscar, one of the Voralberg automatons, who will be the engineer for the mechanical train that takes Kate on most of her journey.

Oscar is the most interesting of the supporting cast of characters, although he is a stickler for the rules, especially about having a ticket before you can proceed from one station to the next.  Most of the other characters get a bit annoying, especially as you go through the unavoidable pointless conversations you have to endure in this sort of game.  It is the nature of the game that they are always impediments to either Kate's overall mission or her specific task at hand (or both).  There are also several dead end characters, where you keep thinking at some point talking to them will be of some importance, but that never proves to be the case.

Then there are the phone calls that Kate gets from back home, where her boss, mother, boyfriend, and supposed best friend harangue her about not getting her mission done and back home as quickly as she can.  Apparently we are supposed to be watching Kate turn from a boring lawyer into an exciting adventurer as she meets her various challenges.  Of course she is the heroine of ""Syberia"" so we tend to think of her as that from the very beginning and keep looking for a way to get her to dump boyfriend Dan as soon as possible.  Of course, you cannot get so annoyed with these phone calls, especially those from Kate's mom, that you do not pay attention to what is being said, because there are some clues there as well.  But overall the phone calls tend to detract from both the adventure and Kate as a character.

The best part of ""Syberia"" are the graphics, which are pretty stunning.  There are nice details to each of the settings, all of which are run down to various degrees.  I like the way the water ripples and the fact that at one point we can see a soccer game being played on a television set in the background.  The music by Nick Varley and Dimitri Bodiansky is also pretty good, with a fairly memorably title theme and some nice Russian/Gypsy influence bits as well.  Most of the tasks are rather mundane but fairly logical, which worked out well for me because I only got super stuck three times in the game (until the very end, where suddenly how to use simple objects like a screwdriver were suddenly an almost insurmountable task).  Those tasks involving automatons are more interesting and that motif, along with that of mammoths, are also enjoyable aspects of the game.  The hardest task, for me, was mixing a drink, but at least once you get through that things move pretty quickly in the end game.

In fact, I was rather surprised when the game ended.  ""Syberia"" comes on two discs and you play with Disc 1 in your DVD-drive and I kept waiting for the point where I had to switch discs, like in ""Phantasmagoria"" and the Gabriel Knight adventures.  My biggest complaint, such as it is, would be that you cannot quickly skip across screens when you have to travel from one end of a train station to another or across town.  You can make her run a bit, but some things just take time.  I was not especially enamored of games where you get to do 360 degree turns (they make me dizzy at times) so I have no problems with this more traditional way of moving the character around.

The bonus disc includes a short ""movie"" on the making of Syberia where B. Sokal and others at Microids in Montreal (they speak French so be prepared to read subtitles), both a trailer and a teaser for the game, some examples of the transition ""From 2D to 3D,"" and a nice collection of desktop wallpaper.  For each of the four locations of ""Syberia"" you have a choice of wallpaper that you could put on your desktop to record your journey through the adventure and remind you that there is some reason Kate is carrying around those metal shears.

The bottom line would be that hardcore adventure game fans are going to find ""Syberia"" too tame for their tastes.  But for the occasional PC game player or even the novice, this inventory/adventure game should be quite enjoyable.

Locations are locked and unlocked throughout the game to keep you from getting lost or wandering around endlessly which is quite nice. If you click a room that you have nothing to do in, you will get a message that tells you this.

There's a map that shows where you are and allows you to transport to places but unfortunately the pictures identifying the locations are not very clear, so sometimes it's hard to see where you want to go. But you won't have to travel too far to get there.

The graphics are very good.

The interactive hidden object scenes have your typical word list. To the best of my memory there weren't any tiny objects to find, but there may have been a couple. The hint button recharges very quickly, but I doubt that you will need it very often.

The games are easy, fun and  unique.

The next couple objectives in your adventure are tucked away in the top left corner.

The hint button charges quickly. It doesn't show you where to go to find something, but where your next objective is to be completed.

I suggest you click the top of an object to pick it up easier. To see the name of an object in your inventory, hold your mouse over it (don't click it) and the name of the object will appear at the top of your inventory box.

The game has an average length of 4 1/2 to 5 hrs.

I highly recommend that you give it a try if you want an easy, exotic mystery to play. :-) Enjoy!

P.S. For those of you who are new to hidden object games remember to check your inventory (located at the bottom of your game) for the things you need. That utility knife has lots of goodies on it.

But for action fans, pack your arsenal and let's have fun hunting some biological weapons !!!

Pros :
- This installment is the most accessible to the casual players. You can stock up your arsenal by re-visiting the past levels for guns, ammo, and treasures as many times as you want. It's a good idea if you feel that your supplies are running too low to proceed to the next stage. It's also good for maxing out your guns.
- Items and ammo found in the stages are just the right amount for each difficulty level. If you play on normal level and don't feel like re-visiting the area, you don't have to.
- Parner AI is fairly smart. She might do stupid things and lagging behnd too far sometimes, but mostly she's there when you need her. Parner can be considered the fast way to heal. You can give all the healing items to her and she'll do the job while you're caugth up in shooting. And co-op mode is definitely a welcoming feature.
- Unlockables are decent enough to add a reasonable replay value to the game.
- Weapons are interesting.

Cons:
- The item farming option makes the game very easy compare to the previous installment that you could get stuck if you don't manage the items well enough. This remove the big chunk of challenge and tension out of the game.
- Knife is, as always, only good for destroying crates and barrels. One-button swing would be great. Move-and-shoot ability would be welcoming also.
- They give you infinite ammo cheat, but not for a grenade launcher. I don't see the reason why they wanted to leave this gun out. It'd be so nice for the trigger-happy players to blast their way through the game with its various selections of ammo.

This is not a pro or con. RE5 is definitely NOT a surviving horror. Anybody expecting creepy atmosphere and heart-pounding moments would be dissappointed. Shooting biological weapons in broad daylight doesn't really do the trick. Enemies can jump you from the blind spot, but that's about it. If you're looking for intense horror elements that makes your stomach squeeze, I'd highly recommend Dead Space instead of this game.

In conclusion, it's a stress-free, action-oriented RE.

I never see RE as a horror franchise. For me, RE1-2 were half-way between action and surviving game with decent amount of creepiness. RE3 was a little more action. So, I'm unable to understand people who complain about this game not being scary anymore. However, I'm not going to be judgmental about that.

As an action game, RE5 does a great job. I had a great fun and beat the game 3 rounds straight on easy to hard difficulty. I'm comfortable with this new and more accessible direction of the franchise.","4.5 stars - Not a Horror Fest, but a Great Action !!!",1239494400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First, we should warn that there were some technical issues with the game. At one point in the middle of the game it started refusing to save, and we needed to update all of our drivers and run the game from the disc once in order to get it to save again. So, we would highly recommend installing all patches and updating all drivers before beginning to play.

Once we had gotten past the technical issues, however, the game was quite enjoyable.

The design of the game was  beautiful. There were several interesting locations which were all designed with a great deal of detail. The plot was cohesive and coherent and we found the ending satisfying, unlike many games we've recently played.

The atmosphere of the game was dark and a bit creepy and squeamish people should note that there are several images of dead bodies and blood. However, those who are looking for a proper horror game should look elsewhere. The atmosphere was gothic, but the game was never really scary (unlike games like Barrow Hill, Dark Fall etc.). Also, you can't die in the game, which we like, but some people might see as a disadvantage.

In terms of game play, the controls were comfortable and convinient, with none of the newfangled attempts at ""innovation"" that usually fail appallingly. It was 3rd person, no 360 panning and all that. In terms of design and controls it was quite similar to the Sherlock Holmes games.

The game was somewhat linear, in the sense that you couldn't really move forward until you had done everything you needed to do. However, it was much much less linear than some games we have played recently (again, the Sherlock Holmes games come to mind). It's not one of those annoying games where you can't pick something up until you know why you need it.

We found the game challenging and the puzzles sufficiently interesting and diverse. It was nice that some puzzles required inventory items while other were pure logic.
For the most part the puzzles were logical and we didn't find ourselves using hints or walkthroughs very often (and when we did, mostly just because we were impatient). There were a few situations where items required a bit of pixel hunting, but this was not too horrible, because of the space-bar feature that allows you to see active areas.

Per our taste, we would have liked the game to be a little bit longer, but it still took us a few weekends to get through it, so it was good value for money.

Overall when comparing it to games we've played recently, we think it's better than the Sherlock Holmes games (which we overall enjoyed but found too linear) but is not as good as The Longest Journey or Syberia.","Good game, but a few technical issues...",1281830400,3,,

With that said, Lost Planet (LP) is a great game,while it doesn't do anything groundbreaking,it offers a lot of fun. The graphics are nothing to write home about but they are nice and do the job well, The story is a little bare bones but does have a surprising plot twist.

4.0,False,"11 19, 2009",ALC6LWQXBHIPG,B00269DX5W,Dredded Deuce,"Assassin's Creed II should get an award for being the most improved series.

This game feels like number one was an experiment on what should have been and truthfully if there was a way to go back and add in all of the the improvements that they put into this one, I could see myself playing thru part one a second time.

So far, in part II, the storytelling is still top notch and a tale of betrayal and how Enzio deals with betrayal and even at the point where I am in the story (Enzio is just getting his villa) the game has played like a very entertaining tutorial. And my character has already met many colorful characters.

So far, Ubisoft has done most of what everyone has asked for. They have added a variety of quests to make this game have more of a sandbox type game. The controls feel a bit better this time around and although in the last iteration I played this on the 360, they still feel comfortable. The voice acting so far, is almost top notch where some of it I feel is a bit forced but it doesnt detract from the game.

One of the things I do like now are the new ways which you can elude guards by throwing down money or hiring folks to distract the guards which keeps a lot more of the stealth elements in the game, whereas in the last iteration you practically had to fight your way in some places just to complete your objective. I also like the crowd blending aspect which was almost absent from the first game. Also it helps that this game has a day and night cycle but it's mostly mission specific.

Another aspect I like is the items upgrade whihc gives this game a tiny bit of an RPG feel. Getting new swords, armor and other items gives more of a sense of progression as the game moves on. Being able to have those items repaired over time also helps. Also seeing a mapmaker to find treasure and a tailor to dye your clothes are fun distractions.

Thankfully ACII didn't bring a lot of the hangups from part I over to this one but there are still a few minuses.

Visually, on the PS3 side, (can't speak for the 360 this time around) the graphics while breathtaking when looking at the cityscape, look a bit murky and not as crisp as its predecessor.

Another thing I noted is (and I am guessing this may change as the game progresses) that once the guards are alerted especially after an assassination, seem easy to ditch.  In the prior iteration sometimes it took a bit longer to ditch them as they sometimes really pursued you but in this almost as soon as you are out of eyesight, they give up.

Also, the combat feels about the same but on the other hand, if it ain't broke don't fix and I never really had a problem with this.

The last thing that I have a slight issue with is although they fixed the pickpocket on this one, it's a bit 'too easy' to walk thru a crowd of people, pick pockets and keep moving. I don't want the mini game back but I don't want this to be a sleepwalk either.

But overall, I am satisfied with how much Ubisoft has progressed this game along with a cool recap at the beginning, an unraveling of the story as it goes as small puzzles and clues that are given to you as you progress.

Some people are also bellyaching about the graphics being poor, but maybe they are more upset about the style than anything else and have not articulated their displeasure properly.  The art is in a more ""cartoonish"" than say DOOM 3 or Call of Duty 5, but it fits in well for the type of game it is.  I'm also playing the DirectPlay version with the patch so am so far unaware of any bugs or performance problems.  Of course I'm running a Quad core 266mz 4 gig oRAM non Vista with ATI 3870 (I think) and absent the prevalent Google,  Yahoo and other  system tray junk and  toolbars as well.

The game description is quite accurate and I can only add my experience so far as I have not completed it or `owned"" any neighborhoods but got a good feel for the game.

 First, I must say if one is a bit squeamish about shooting virtual cops , stealing cars, running people over in the streets either on purpose or by accident do NOT get this game.  One can learn some bad habits, very bad habits.  If these things are not a concern then one can, even with this dark humor PC game capture a glimpse into the seamy, slimy yet seductive world of the ""GangSTA.""

Since a lot of time can be invested into customizing the character, to include changing the brow and eye shadow, I opted for using the default character to began my life  of mayhem and villainy.

 I chose an activity at random which involved assuming the role of a police officer on a ""Cops"" type show where a cameraman followed me around the city and filmed my subduing of citizens involved in insurance fraud, prostitutes protesting and helmetless motorcyclists.  ""You guys use flamethrowers, right?, "" queries the cameraman as he hands me the weapon to assist in my bust and to get the best footage possible.

The city, looks remarkably like some aging east coast metropolis (think Paterson or Newark), and is filled with life and activity.  Cars travel the streets and the inhabitants go about their business whether or not you care (unlike many other games were the world is your stage and everyone is awaiting your performance).  Though the interiors of the buildings are not all accessible, I imagine it is only a matter of time before game designers have an entire city with fully functional inhabited multistory buildings.  As it is, there are vast areas of the city to explore which can be done with a car or on foot.

A minimap keeps the player on track to where the location of the next mission is, so the game keeps moving.  Once the suspects are spotted (a bouncing red arrow indicates who they are), the preferred method of subduing is the supplied hardware (in this case the aforementioned flamethrower).  Get out of the car, use the mousewheel and select that toasty weapon and start flaming away ""oh man you're the best cop ever!"", says my camera man as he gets the valued footage.

Now it's a little too easy to do the ""unintended"" in this game; in the case of the flamethrower, I fired, moved ahead to get better shot and accidently set myself on fire as I ran through the still active burst.  Another time I was going to beat a suspect with my baton, but missed and battered a nearby fellow policewoman to death instead --oops.  When standing near a person then walking away, I often bump into them on my way past, angering them.  And driving?  Forget about it, liquered up jabbering homeless people on crak are far safer to be around.  The vehicle is very sensitive to movements of the game controller so I found it very easy to accidentally swerve into objects and people.  This of course might just be the result of not enough practice using the controller.

Pros: Huge city to freeform explore, apparently many activities to do.  Good graphics (though its cartoonish style may be a put off to Call of Duty realists).

Wash: flamed people killed do not show as crispy, just corpse with pool of blood.  Failed missions are total redo's starting from the beginning rather than trying again on another day.  For example, if I didn't  get enough footage in during the ""Cops"" filming, the mission starts all over as if I never attempted it (which in my view breaks the continuity of the living virtual world).

Cons (but not really that bad): no mouse curser available on the menu screens, shift  alt and arrow buttons must be used to go through menu selections.

4.0,False,"10 10, 2003",AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00005NOFM,TwistaG,"Over the past three years, Activision's Tony Hawk franchise has consistently proven to be one of the best action sports series on every platform it has appeared on, which currently tallies up to eight, and each sequel has been different enough and fun enough to keep bringing players back for more. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is no exception and is probably the only Game Boy Advance game to truly usurp Tony Hawk 2. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 plays just how you'd expect Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 to play, albeit from an isometric perspective. In the single-player mode, you'll skate around different locations, completing various objectives to progress to the next level. You're given a choice of 13 real-life pro skaters, and there is also a create-a-skater option, which lets you alter the skin tone, shirt, pants, shoes, and tattoos of your skater. The objectives you'll have to complete include three different score objectives, as well as collect letters to spell the word ""skate,"" find a hidden tape, and meet a slew of level-specific goals that range from delivering airline tickets to a family in the Airport level to grinding specific rails in the LA level, which triggers an earthquake and changes the terrain of the level. There's actually a fair amount of level interaction like this in Tony Hawk 3, though it isn't quite as deep as that found in the console versions of Tony Hawk 3. What it does offer makes the gameplay experience a bit more enjoyable. Out of the six levels in the game, two of them are competition levels, in which the objective is to score as many points as you can with as few bails as possible in the allotted time limit. The gameplay is essentially identical to that of Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA, though there have been a few noteworthy changes. The default control configuration assigns nollies and flip tricks to the left shoulder button, grinds to the A button, jumps to the B button, and grab tricks and the revert to the right shoulder button, but it can be customized to your liking. Yes, Tony Hawk 3 features the revert, a handy maneuver used to integrate vert tricks into the middle of combos. Unlike Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA, Tony Hawk 3 has four different multiplayer modes. Horse, the game in which each player attempts to match the previous player's trick, can be played with up to four players using a single GBA. The three link cable modes are trick attack, tag, and king of the hill. Trick attack is a simple score-based competition, while tag and king of the hill are essentially reversed versions of the same game, in which players either try to stay away from the skater who's ""it"" or take the crown away from the skater who's the ""king."" Multiplayer games have always been a staple of the Tony Hawk franchise, and the modes included here are just as fun and playable as in any other incarnations of Tony Hawk.
Tony Hawk 2 still stands as one of the sharpest-looking games for the GBA, and Tony Hawk 3 improves upon it. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, giving you a wide overview of the level around you. The skaters are 3D polygonal models that are expertly animated and represent their console counterparts beautifully. And while the skater models in Tony Hawk 2 were textured with flat colors, in Tony Hawk 3, they have simple but effective textures that bring them just a bit closer to replicating the real thing. The levels also look great, though the isometric perspective can still sometimes be cumbersome. Vicarious Visions has smoothed out the formula a bit since Tony Hawk 2, so the view doesn't create quite as many frustrating moments. Vicarious Visions has also done a great job of re-creating the sounds of Tony Hawk on the Game Boy Advance. All the skate sounds, from your trucks grinding a rail to the roll of your wheels over concrete, have been sampled directly from the console versions, and all the effects sound sharp. The game features a soundtrack of digital renditions of numerous songs from the Tony Hawk 3 soundtrack, though the selections are almost entirely guitar-based songs, making the soundtrack slightly less appealing if you don't like rock. The tracks are surprisingly true to the source material, but some get a bit muddled in the translation. With the great impression that Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA made on many gamers, Vicarious Visions could have easily just thrown the Tony Hawk 3 levels into the same exact game and still have a quality title. Instead, it went the extra mile and included an improved trick system, improved graphics, multiplayer support, and a create-a-skater mode, creating an exceptional game and maintaining the Tony Hawk tradition of perpetually creating better games. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 used to be the must-own action sports game for the Game Boy Advance. Meet the new titleholder.","Just like the PS version, only smaller",1065744000,,,

It is definitely an improvement on the Sims series and there are some new features that make it worthy of the title ""3."" However, lets not beat around the bush. My title does include the phrase ""2 steps back,"" and this is true. There are some things that baffle me about the Sims 3. Like why did EA get rid of some features that made the Sims 2 so great and why didn't they make this third installment the best it could be? Here are the things they did that were great:

PROS
Create-a-Sim feature- this is by far the best improvement in the Sims series. All those wacky adjustment meters from the Sims 2 are gone -well, they aren't gone exactly but HIGHLY improved. If you try to change your sims face, for example, you won't get some weirdo sim face. Now you can adjust in great detail, from the arch of the eyebrow to the height of the cheekbones. Every feature of the face has an ""advanced"" button, which allows you to design your sim with precision. Another great feature is the customization. The game comes with premade colors and designs for hair and clothes but if you want to get more creative, you can easily click on the paint palette and choose from a huge selection of custom colors. If you want to give your sim pink and yellow hair, you can! Similarly, the clothes come in a few colors and patterns, but you can go into great detail customizing every piece of cloth. The new sim creator is simply revolutionary. No two sims will ever be alike with this feature.

Graphics- the graphics in number 3 have been given much more detail. When I first saw a lot, I was amazed. Everything looks pristine..crystal clear, as if you could touch it. Of course I have already discussed the detail the actual sims have. They too look life-like.

Buy mode- buying things is so much better now. You can place things wherever you want to! There is even a nice diagonal feature that allows you to place furniture at an angle. Other than that, it's pretty much the same.

Work- you can follow your sim to work now! You can even make choices that affect how well they do that day at work. No more waiting around an empty house!

Traits- this is part of the create-a-sim feature. No more ""nice versus mean"" and ""clean versus dirty."" Now you can select four traits for teenagers and five traits for young adults and up. These include things like ambitious, excitable, clumsy, absent-minded, hot-headed, natural cook, etc. There are many to choose from. Like I said, no sim will be the same! You also get to choose a lifetime wish based on these traits which affect your life and job. You choose one out of about five. This makes wishes have to do with your sim's life, not something completely random like in sims 2. You can also choose your sims favorite food, music, and color.

Those are what make the sims 3 really cool and improved! Now for the things EA could have paid more attention to...

CONS
Build mode- I am one of those people who LOVED building my sims houses, so I am slightly disappointed in the build mode of the sims 3. Now don't take this too much to heart bc I haven't tried building stuff yet. I have tried the paint mode. I am extremely disappointed. When choosing paint for your walls, it is very difficult because the color you see in the preview square and the one you put on the walls are completely different! For some reason the wall colors are very dark, though they don;t appear that way in the catalog. It's weird and unfortunate bc you have to spend an hour choosing a paint because they all look different than the preview. Too bad...

Relationships..It is way too hard to meet people in the sims 3. You have to spend hours just trying to get someone to become slightly interested in you. Making friends...well that takes time! It was much more doable in the sims 2.

Time...some things just take to long. Besides relationships, sleeping takes very long and the sims get tired WAY too easily. by the time my sims return from work and school they are wiped and don't even have time to do homework!! This can get frustrating.

Going places... the whole seamless neighborhood thing is overrated. It is nice not to have to take a load screen everywhere you go, but I find it hard to actually take advantage of the seamless neighborhood. Those screenshots that amazon provides are so not like the game at all. I don't see any neighbors out and about in my game. The cool thing is you can watch your sim drive from home to a lot. But once you get, say, to work, you can;t see inside. There are only some community lots that you can see your sim inside of. Most of them, like work, the diner, you watch from outside while your sim does god knows what inside! I am not exactly sure why EA decided to do this as in the sims 2 everywhere was open; you could see your sim. This is also an unfortunate feature EA did not pay attention to.

Traits...Like I said these are great! They allow you to customize your sim. However after playing for a couple times, the traits aren't very noticeable. Like my hot-headed sim will get a little angrier than my other sims, but nothing significant. I was really expecting something way more drastic and exciting.

I haven';t played enough yet to have any other cons, so you will have to play and explore the game for yourself. I will say that it is a lot of fun and the new features are very well done. Yes, there are some cons, as always, but I think they are small compared to the pros. They are the kind of thing where you say to yourself ""man why didn't they fix that!"" but nothing that will make you dislike the game! It doesn't really merit the title three, either. I would say sims 2.5. They have a little more improvements to make to really make it a full three.
I would also like to point out that I play on a Macbook Pro and it runs very smoothly. I haven't had any crashes and game performance is exceptional! Load time is also incredibly fast! I can;t say how it runs on PC. But for Mac users, make sure you update your system software for the game to run best.

I've never played the original 2 deadrising games mostly because I didn't care for the timer system. DR 3 however, does away with the timer and improves upon the combat mechanics of the previous titles. The story starts off pretty weak but does improve as it goes on. The whole point of the game is to be sorta stereotypical. The game, in its own way is almost a parody of the zombie genra. The high point of the game is defiantly the crafting system which is pretty complex. At first, it can be hard to find the materials to build the super powered combo weapons, but when you upgrade it becomes easier. And just to be clear you don't have to know much about the previous games to dive in and blast the crap out of some zombies. The game has a pretty large open world, the city of Los perdidos, a fictionalized version of LA. It manages to seamlessly transition from a hack n' slash to a pretty well made third person shooter. DR 3 is also pretty lighthearted for a survival horror game with plenty of silly weapons, costumes, and characters.

Most of the game you are a human running around in first person shooter mode.  This is pretty cool.  Sometimes you will have to look around in the environment to find things to use.  An example would be finding a spearlike object to hurl at a t-rex.  THis sounds like it would be tough, but it really isn't.  While you cock the spear with one hand, your other hand points to where you will throw the spear.  THis brings up a very unique aspect of the game.  There is no health meter, no reticle for shooting, no ammo readout.  NO nothing.  You are IN the game just as a real person would be.  This helps with the immersion in the game.

I second N.J. Johnson's comments in this review section.

Let me tell you though, I think Battlefield:Bad Company is a better game...better than both COD4 and WaW. It has very large maps, the visuals are brighter and more ""soft"" looking, and the accoustics are superior. I also think the class system is better over in BC land. Heck, buy that game too, I would like to see more volume over there!

Still, this game, as does COD4, has neat variations/perks you gain through gaming experience, that help ""trick out"" your tools of the trade.

Campaign co-op is a nice feature I wish more FPS games had, including Bad Company.

After that, I purchased each and every expansion pack as soon as they came out.  I grew older though and soon distanced myself from the series which was about the time Zoo tycoon 2 came out.  I was cleaning up my stuff one day and found my old Zoo Tycon: Complete expansion pack.  Floods of nostalgia came pouring in as I set it up and played it.  I then recalled them making a brand new series and so I looked it up.  By then, Endangered Species came out so I downloaded a demo of it and loved it!  The very next day I went out and purchased Zoo Tycoon 2 and recently, purchased both Endangered Species and African Adventure.  Needless to say, this is not like the first series but it holds it own.

The exhibits are not challenging to make (I recall yelling at the stupid Markhor to like his exhibit in the old ZT) however the ennviroment that ZT2 has makes up for it - how the animals interact with thier surroundings.

The original had 44 animals.  We see alot of these return however some favorites don't make it into this game.  However, ZT2 includes animals that people were begging for (i.e. Ring-tailed Lemur, American Beaver, Peafowl, Red Panda) even though it's only 30 of them.  These animals would of never been able to be put in the orginal ZT but in this series, we get them.  As well, this might of had 30 animals in it but add 40 extra animals from the most recent expansion packs and you got yourself a nice selection of animals to choose from.

The zookeepers are pretty dumb in this game however the guests are very animated and more personal.

The zoo keeper mode is just plain cool.

The only thing I am a bit skeptical on is some of the animal behaviors and the amount of buildings in this game.  I miss the Bird, Reptile, Insect houses that the first ZT had.

I went to a website that collects professional reviews and found a lot of good reviews for the game. With that in mind I decided to play this game. Boy, was I surprised at how good it really is.
The game play is like any other Ratchet and Clank game. Being a fan of the series it all looked very familiar. The action is quite very good. The weapons are quite as good as well. Like in other R&C games you get weapon upgrades each time you pass a level. Of course, you have to earn the nuts and bolts to buy the weapon upgrades.
The graphics is similar to first generation Playstation 2 games. You could compare this to the first Ratchet and Clank game but that one is a little bit better in graphics polish. This game is a port from the PSP after all. I have never played the PSP version so I cannot attest to how the graphics have been upgraded. But I imagine that they had to as the larger screen will expose all the low resolution textures of the PSP version.
The voice work in this game is as usual very well done. The characters all sound great and match them. The environments are where they could have done a better job. But then the PSP version must have been quite muddy to begin with. But the set pieces and characters are all well done. The cut-scenes are actually well done, too. The characters are smoothed out.
The mini-games is where the game gets some low notes. Fortunately, you don't have to play most of them. The production quality of the mini-games do not match the work put into the rest of the game.
The game controls very well. My only gripe is that the camera can be unintuitive. Sometimes it will be at an angle where you think it should be. Fortunately, you are able to change the camera angle via the analog stick. When I played the game it added some challenge to the battles but not so much that it was game changer for me. I found the battles to be fun.
If you have never played the PSP version of this game, you owe it to yourself to play this game. It is really a lot of fun. If you are a fan of the Ratchet and Clank series, you must play this game or you will have missed out on part of the R&C history.","Actually, A Fun Game",1272585600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I must have played racing the VW bus in a figure 8 for at least an hour because I found that to be interesting. The problem was every time I hit a marker or another VW bus I was disqualified. Then I really got into the go-karts for a while. I must admit the go karts are fun, but at the higher levels it's so easy to spin out on the grass. When I spun out, I couldn't recover and I pretty much automatically lost (because the go kart is always facing the wrong way). Both of those games kept me entertained for a while, but the nuisance of being disqualified or spinning out at the intermediate levels and above, I became frustrated.

The most fun I had was using the Benz Stealth car,(pre-order through Amazon) because even if I messed up I was racing a Toyota Corolla, and I could afford to mess up. This game is a driving simulator, so I guess that means no fun. When going into a sharp 105 degree (slightly obtuse angle) curve at 55 mph, and the car doesn't react and crashes STRAIGHT into the wall, that isn't what a great simulator should represent. I had 3 people verify this. NO burning rubber, no skidding, just crashing straight into the wall. I'm not speaking about a hairpin curve. I drive 20 mph for those. On top of that, what kind of simulator has cars crashing into you when you're ahead of them? Aren't they supposed to overtake you by going around?
 Simulator does not equal not fun. Maybe it's different with the wheel. I just don't see what everybody else is seeing. Sorry.

Overall, great cars, great variation, great scenery, graphics, relaxing music, but driving unmodified standard cars and a flawed AI directly hinders the game play and users initial reactions.

I pre-ordered this game digitally and managed to get South Park Stick of Truth. As a South Park experience, it was exceptionally good. But unfortunately as a game, it was pretty underwhelming. The turn base combat was fine, I like that feeling of a classic RPG, but it was extremely easy that the game felt more like an interactive movie. Because of this, the game felt short as well, I honestly think the game took me around 6 hours to beat. Which as for a free download for pre-ordering the new game is fine, but I'd be lying if I said ""I wasn't expecting more."" The Fractured But Whole on the other hand actually felt more like a game while still having that South Park charm. See when I was playing the Stick of Truth, I used a lot of my already knowledge of RPG titles to essentially look every inch and cranny for special gear, equipment, and other items and it was like no matter what I collected, the only things that had use was the armor and the ""Junk"" you collected was... just that, junk. Throughout a majority of that playthrough I kept hold of everything because I thought there would be a crafting system, but reality they were all useless items that were made to only be sold to vendors. The Fractured But Whole actually is the opposite. This time, the equipment you wear has no effect on your character and you can look like however you like to. And the ""Junk"" this time around are crafting items as the game this time includes a crafting system. Though you'll have to buy recipes from vendors, but this time every item you pick up has some form of use. For those who think that the ""No Stats on Equipment"" may be a problem, don't worry it's not. This time your stats are all based on Artifacts that you can either find in the game, or craft on your own assuming you found the recipe. And as you level up, you'll gradually unlock new slots to add more artifacts, but there is a limit so it's not like you'll be able to equip every single artifact in the game. And the combat, the combat is probably what makes this game feel more like a game... well in comparison with Stick of Truth that is. I mentioned that the Stick of Truth was simple and easy, but what I didn't mention was how easy. The affliction status the game had (Shock, Bleed, Gross-Out, and Freeze) were fairly easy to abuse and take out opponents, making much of the game a walkthrough, even on the hardest difficulty. While the Fractured but Whole still includes these affliction statuses, they're not as common as it would be as instead of a turnbase RPG, it's more of a tactical RPG. You have to plan your moves and your attacks with the board you're on. And with each game having at least 8 characters on the field (you, 3 teammates, and 4+ opponents) you'll likely won't get every affliction on one opponent like you would in Stick of Truth. I've talked a lot of positives, what about negatives? Well there are some. First gripe, despite this game feeling like it has more challenge than it's predecessor, Ubisoft can ruin it and make your game experience a walkthrough. Ubisoft Club is implemented in The Fractured But Whole (just like every Ubisoft Published game) and it includes artifacts that are quite powerful to have both early and late game. And it may seem cool to get the Assassin's Creed Outfit plus Hidden Blade Artifact, that Hidden Blade Artifact can make a hard run be normal at worst, especially when you also equip the other two artifacts that are also offered in Ubisoft Club. What's more is these Artifacts can be upgraded in the crafting menu and all the requirements you need are... just the artifacts themselves. Well at least you also have to level up your crafting skill, but honestly it's not hard to pull off so you can pretty much bulldoze your way through the game. Another slight negative is this game... kind of takes place after the last season of South Park, Season 20; also known as the Story Season that not many liked. The Fractured But Whole will have Member Berries to find over Chinpokomon, and PC Principal is present too... but they're not that heavy noted in the game. I mean I don't like PC Principle but you really interact with him twice and that's it. But still, this could leave a sour taste in a few people's mouths as Season 20 wasn't all that hot. So is the Fractured But Whole worth it? Well even though I got nearly over double the hours compared to Stick of Truth, I think getting Fractured But Whole alone will be best when it goes on sale, maximum of $40. But if you happen to manage to find a physical copy of the game that includes Stick of Truth, then yeah I can safely say that this is a recommended purchase. South Park The Fractured But Whole is a great South Park game, better than the Stick of Truth in opinion. And the game has a lot of South Park references (New and Old) that wasn't featured in Stick of Truth.

Thankfully, Konami realized this and put in a good mix of songs, at least some of which you have heard (unless you lived in a cave for seveal decades...)  There're probably at least five songs on there you know.  You can always find the song list online if you wish, just note that some songs need to be unlocked by beating songs/reaching score goals.  The ability to add on ""Expansion Dics"" is also an interesting feature, but we'll see if this is a tease or if Konami will put out a good selection to make the 69.99 investment worthwhile.
The difficulty is varied as well, with different settings for strictness in judging, and how much you need to sing before one ""step"" is completed with a ""great"" result.
Appreciated greatly are also features for adjusting the mic sensitivity, although that could be fine tuned a bit to have less blunt settings.  Another feature that deserves praise is that you can select volume for the lead singer, music, mic, and how loud the song plays in your headset.
Now to the negative bits of the game.
One thing I've noticed is that one has the ability to mumble in the correct key and not actually sing audible words and still manage to hit combos.  While that might be a legitimate technical limitaiton, it's discouraging to have someone score higher than you, but not actually sing anything.
There could have been a much better story that might have gone with the ""Showtime Mode"".  I barely noticed that what Konami intended was that you are an aspiring singer moving up in the world of music.  Also the difficulty does not go up as you try to beat the venues, although it would make sense for audience at a stadium to be more critical at one at a party in someone's home.
Back to the Expansion packs.  Where are they?  Konami probably didn't want to confuse buyers by releasing the expansion packs the same date as the main game, but it would have been nice if they had a closer release date than December. (That is only assuming there's no delay in the release date.)

Well the new election is coming up and I was eagerly awaited the updated Political Machine 2008 release (PM08.)

The Good:
First, PM08 is easy to jump right into and start playing.  It is more intuitive than PM04.  The graphics are upgraded and cool.  You can use the extensive controls to design your own bobble head to play with.  I made an evil DNC hipster guy w/ multiple piercings and a GOP dominatrix with a cane. New 121 week campaign is awesome.

The Bad:
PM08 is not as hard as PM04.  It might be the issues are more neutral this time, but I found, that on the Masochistic setting I had no problem beating the machine.  It may just be my assumptions about the character settings that serve me so well.  The AI is weak and fails to fully respond to my specific attacks.  On the other hand, maybe I'm Karl Rove and Lee Atwater hybrid and don't know it.  It does crash in Vista 64 every about 8-10 hours.  Sometimes it is hard to find specific characters on a state in order to ""Fix"" them this isn't a big problem in short campaign but if your running 20-30 ads in California and have 3-4 Smear Merchants in state finding the enemy Definer is difficult.

The Ugly politics of it all.
Now for an example screwed up of player data.  Money (wealth) is all screwed up.  Starting with the richest John Kerry (7 rating) who doesn't count since Theresa doesn't let him touch it.

Mitt Romney (6 rating) worth 300-500 million should be getting a 10 but gets only a 6.
Cheney (7 rating) worth $90-110 million should be 9
Bush (8 rating) is worth $15-25 million should be 6
Obama (6 rating) is worth around $2 million including the corrupt Chicago land deals
McCain (6 rating) worth $25-40 million should be 6
Bill Clinton (6 rating) worth about $35 million is about right.
Hillary Clinton (8 rating) huh? worth the same, unless a divorcee came through.
John Edwards (6 rating) worth about $30 to 60 million. Should be 7.

So the numbers are all screwed up Obama only gets a 7 for fund raising. Bill Clinton rightfully gets a 9 and W gets a deserved proper 8.  Obama should have a 2-3 for money and a 10 for fund razing.  The polls are too kind to the GOP on Iraq.  In the same vain they are far to kind to the DNP on High Gas Prices.  I could go on.

This game came out a LONG time ago...like 4 years ago.  It was one of the first true RPGs for the PSP, back when the PSP was expensive and riddled with dead pixels.  At the time we really had one other choice: Untold Legends, with its horrific load times.  There were others like the Legend of Heroes series, but none that really stood out.  Until PoPoLo.  If you don't know, PoPoLo is an old series.  They've been released multiple times across systems in Japan, along with numerous anime series about it.

What you need to know about this game is that on the surface there is little appealing about it.  The graphics are extremely simplistic - I mean EXTREMELY simplistic.  To the point you will ask yourself if you're playing an NES game.  This is definitely an issue, but if you learn to appreciate the charm of the graphics they will grow on you.  If you can get past the surface you will eventually find a very deep game with a slightly wrenching story.  The challenge is getting past it, and trust me it will not be easy.  What makes it worse is the fact that the first chapter of the game is quite possibly the worst gaming experience in the history of gaming.  The story is dull and the 'action' is lackluster.  It took me three non-starters before I finally mustered up the patience to get past chapter 1, and once I got beyond that chapter the rest got better and better like a fine wine.

Key to the appeal to the game for me was the anime cutscenes.  In my opinion this is a lost art in gaming; they just don't put anime in games anymore since Working Delays died...it's an unfortunate loss, because having the cutscenes in the game really extends the story in a tremendous way.

Put it like this:  There is a reason Amazon is selling this game, some 4 years later, for what is essentially full retail price.

If your thing is games like Bioshock or whatnot, you won't like this game, nor will you give it the time it deserves.  If you're still interested in NES and/or SNES games, this game is worth a short.  But keep in mind - chapter 1 is terrible.

4.0,False,"05 13, 2010",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B002DC8GEK,Cloud,"When you see critic reviews all but outright lashing at the game to fan reviews saying it's a ton of fun and not worth the amount of negativity thrown at it, you can see that this is clearly a game that has a ""try out and see"" approach. Not to say Capcom has had completely flawless run-ins with the press lately. Devil May Cry 4 had a great first half only to be marred by the entire first half literally played backwards by a different character. Or the really stellar Resident Evil 5 that everyone complained was exactly like Resident Evil 4 when other games are just like prior entries too. So when one hears of oddball game mechanics and approaches to their games in the reviews, you might be a bit hesitant to give Lost Planet 2 a try but this is a game where the reviewers are right in saying this isn't completely flawless but the low scores and negativity thrown at it seems a bit overdone and the best way to gauge whether this game is for you is just play it and see what you think. Stunning graphics, some great score and some of the biggest bosses you'll ever come across also comes with some screwy controls, a near pointless plot and not to mention a game that seems programmed specifically for co-op and you got the makings of a great game that's only good and worth playing but man, if only somebody looked at the bigger picture and said ""hey, wait a minute....what if we were to change...?""

Story: The story takes place on the planet E.D.N. III, a once-frozen planet completely covered in snow now largely changed in the 10 years since the adventures of Wayne and Co. in the first game. Instead of having one character go through the game chapter-hopping, they all involve different groups with different objectives that will come to a head near the end. What this means is that the story feels slightly inconsequential since you control nameless dudes who are trying to do something you're not quite sure yet against people you're not introduced to. However this also means some diversity in locations so you can hop from frozen tundras to thick jungles to deserts and back which makes up for the repetitive-but-pretty all snow environments of the first game.

Graphics: Complain all you want about the games of Capcom but you can't argue against their graphic-making abilities which are pretty stellar. From Resident Evil 5 to Street Fighter IV to this, this company knows how to make some really impressive looking games and this game is no different. From the locales you'll see to the absolutely enormous bosses, the MT Framework engine that powers the game is quite a powerful one indeed. However there is some slowdown when things go boom a bit too big and on the train level which I'll get into later, I literally ran into a glitch where the shells required to load into the gun's cannon were floating in mid-air. But from a look standpoint, Lost Planet 2 certainly has the chops but it's not quite 100% smooth but it looks damn fine trying to get there.

Sound/Music: When things aren't exploding so loudly that it completely drowns it out, the music in the game is appropriately epic, intense and nicely bombastic. Things get exciting really quickly and the music used reflects it and that main menu music which you'll be hearing a lot of, I'm sure, is catchy but not so it becomes grating after the 105th damn time. Sound effects are also nicely made from the screeches and roars of the Akrid to the gunfire of the different weaponry, this is a game for your surround sound system or some great headphones. The same can't be said for the voice acting which feels appropriately Capcom. Not as much emotion and dialogue choices read exactly as you'd expect them to: almost flat. Occasionally they'll do some good work in other games but it just feels really iffy here.

Gameplay: Unlike games like say Halo 3, Borderlands, or Gears of War which can be played single player but the main bulk of fun comes in co-op, Lost Planet 2 in a way feels like it was designed specifically to be played with more than one person. And when you see the near brain-dead AI of your squadmates, it's easy to see why you need extra players. They barely shoot and half the time they stand there while you're running around trying to do the bulk of the work which makes the campaign feel really average but then you have some buddies and everything makes sense. Tactics come into play, players can be relegated to a specific weapon usage or task and strategies can be made more efficiently. Take for example Chapter 3-3 (the chapter nearly every reviewer has complained about, dubbing it the ""train level""). In this chapter, you start off on a train traveling parallel to an enemy train so you can have one guy with a sniper rifle shooting guys from afar, one with a rocket launcher blowing up the turrets and enemy air support while a 3rd can carry a shield to soak up some damage and keep your other guys safe. Then there's the boss fight in which a huge sense of roles and tasks have to be laid out to each member: you're on a cannon which needs to be fired at weak points of probably the biggest boss you've ever seen. Those shells need to be loaded into the chamber, energized for quicker reloading and potentially given some help with a console that allows for quicker gun rotation. This is not done automatically and whoever is shooting has to rely on the other 3 to supply the shells, load them, energize them and help the rotation speed of the barrel or you're dead. And what if you take damage? Then you need someone to go below decks and activate the coolant systems which act as damage repairmen and gun cooldown. Not to mention there's gun turrets somebody can climb into to shoot down giant meteors or help shooting at the weak points. Think the AI will do all that on its own? Think again.

But this co-op has some side effects. The game operates on a lobby system where you can find a game for a specific episode within a specific chapter and hope one of them says ""standing by"" because that means they're in the menus and haven't started yet. If their status is ""playing"" however, you have to wait till they're done before you can come in as there's no join in progress or drop in/drop out co-op in the game. Also co-op can have slight frustrations involving the Battle Gauge. When you activate data posts or accomplish objectives, you add some points to a battle gauge but points get deducted if someone dies. So nearly every death can be treated as a surefire way to get people to yell at you since you're the one who keeps dying and getting your whole team closer to a mission failure. As far as the competitive multiplayer is concerned, it's fun but some issues from campaign carry over. Getting shot puts you in a stun animation, leaving you unable to fire back, heal or do much of anything except rolling or hopefully throwing a grenade which kills the other player first. Unlike games like Call of Duty or Halo where one-on-ones were won by skill and accuracy and which gun you brought, this game feels more like ambush tactics: surprise attack someone and shoot them first before they can do anything. Also nearly every mode has what you'll be doing a lot of in the campaign which is dealing with data posts. In both campaign and multiplayer, these data posts act like spawn points but unlike other games where standing in the area started the capturing, you have to mash B against the data post which leaves you completely vulnerable to weaponry and grenades. This can of course allow players to wait till you try to activate it then kill you while you're completely defenseless. But the modes and gameplay are rarely seen in multiplayer now which makes it quite unique to other games where it's mainly FPS and somewhat familiar.

Another gripe is how you unlock things. In a lot of multiplayer games, unlocks came through level progression: more you played, better toys you got to tinker with. In Lost Planet 2 on the other hand, some of that is unlocks while others have to be literally won from a slot machine. The more you collect those ""?"" boxes in campaign, the more points you add to your total which act as your ""quarters"" for the slot machine where you can win new weaponry, abilities that can alter how your character can behave in combat but mainly you'll be seeing emotes and ""noms de guerre"", in other words, nicknames. Emotes are done by pressing the Start button and either any D-pad direction or the shoulder buttons and they're strictly poses whereas noms de guerres are kind of like your callsigns but when you're being bested by players that have better weaponry or better abilities than you in multiplayer, it can be frustrating when all you keep unlocking are names.

That being said, the gunfights and Akrid encounters can be incredibly intense, the multiplayer from the first game had a very strong community and that'll no doubt be translated here and the game's achievements and trophies feel designed to do one thing: make you play the game over and over. Level up the different factions to level 99, kill an insane amount of enemies, collect everything from the slot machine and play the chapters a whole bunch. This is one of the longest 1000/Platinums you'll find. The game is certainly not without its faults but avoiding the game altogether isn't really the way to go about it. Unless you're a diehard fan of the first or loved the demos in which case you most likely already played it or about to, give the game a try since everyone will react differently. Some of you will love it so much you won't mind playing the game for the next year or more while some others will think it's just way too flawed and backwards and not worth your trouble. I like it and I'd recommend but keep in mind this is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of game so I'm in the former camp so just have to see which camp you fall into.",Fun and/or frustration awaits you,1273708800,47,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The story which takes place approximately 250 years after the original Guild Wars - Eye of the North, follows the story of the emergence of the long slumbering Elder Dragons and the threat they pose to the current inhabitants of Tyria. The tale is catered to the character you create and play from a choice of 5 races (Human, Charr, Sylvari, Norn and Asura) and 8 professions (Guardian, Warrior, Engineer, Ranger, Thief, Elementalist, Mesmer and Necromancer) with a plethora of skills to customize your character's play style. After you create your character you begin your choice based storyline and join other players in the struggle against the Elder Dragons. Here are my thoughts on Guild Wars 2;

Pros

+ Beautiful and moving original soundtrack by Jeremy Soule.

+ Level scaled grouping.

+ Plenty of solo and group play.

+ Massively scaled world and cities.

+ Beautifully designed zones with plenty of places to explore and puzzles to solve.

+ Gorgeous graphics.

+ Personalized storyline.

+ Brilliant voice acting.

+ Revamped combat system combining both twitch and skill based abilities.

+ New playable races and characters.

+ Fluid combat and action animations.

+ Free to play. No monthly fees. Just buy the game and you're done.

+ Dye your characters whenever you'd like for free. No more collecting or having to buy/trade for dye.

+ Voluntary PvP.

+ Area quests.

Cons

- Finding a group option or lack thereof was really a pain.

- Storyline is a bit too predictable and can become dull and unoriginal at times.

- Massive environments often feel empty of enemies.

- Some really unattractive looking armor and gear.

- Not a fan of the technology/gun aspects of the Asura/Charr/Engineer. It really drew me out of the original fantasy setting of Guild Wars.

- A few events, classes and dungeons are still broken, unbalanced and buggy.

- Micro-transaction cash shop. I dislike it in any game I play that has it.

- Many quests fall victim to the stereotypical go here, kill X number of things, harvest X number of things etc. I really dislike this in MMO's.

- Didn't feel much like the original Guild Wars to me other than the lore.

- Can be graphically heavy on the system.

- Grinding for gear.

The original Guild Wars (and all following expansions) is one of my favorite fantasy role-playing games of all times. I spent an immeasurable amount of hours questing and exploring the huge amounts of content so when Guild Wars 2 was announced I set my hopes pretty high. As screenshots, gameplay and developer videos began to emerge I became even more excited about the upcoming title. At the same time I also began to feel a hint of apprehension as Guild Wars 2 seemed to be taking a sizable departure from the original. My feelings ended up being true on both accounts. Although the game is remarkable overall, it didn't feel much like the original Guild Wars did to me. The game itself is gorgeous and there's an enormous amount of places to explore, quests to complete and things to do. As far as a no monthly fee/buy to play MMO it's easily the best on the market at the moment. Guild Wars 2 may not be perfect, but it's still a great game.

It is an excellent effort and I have already spent tons of hours playing it. I also did hear that Respawn was on a limited schedule, so they couldn't do everything that had planned out. And most impressively, I did see that they will be making add-ons for free that they thought should have been included in the game.

To continue to play Titanfall I would need to see updates for players having more classes of pilots, more titans, a co-op mode and more interaction on maps. I was not destroyed by the lack of a campaign because personally in the past I spent about 10% playing campaign and 90% online play. Though, I would like to see these updates on the more titans, pilot classes, and co-op mode because without those I can't really justify playing Titanfall much longer, or buying Titanfall 2 for $60 in the future.

4.0,False,"11 4, 2014",A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B00IPTUJ8G,R. Pickman,"I played Borderlands 2 on the console when it was first released. I loved the game, but for whatever reason never finished. It's easier for me to find time to play my portable systems, so when I saw that this had been released for the Vita, it was a no-brainer.

For those of you who haven't played any Borderlands titles. It is essentially a cel-shaded Fallout 3/New Vegas type experience that is much more light-hearted and humorous. It's a FPS/RPG at its core. The writing is quirky and hilarious. Dialogue is all delivered fantastically, and gameplay is a blast. The game itself is an easy 4 or 5 star experience through and through.

Borderlands 2 is essentially a free-to-play 4 person co-op first person shooter dungeon crawling mmorpg. The story is engaging and very well paced. The different classes are surprisingly varied. Each class has a skill tree a la WoW/Diablo/Etc and allows for a wealth of customization options. Co-op is fun and loot is plentiful.

On the Vita, however... They did a very nice job porting the title. Texturally and graphically it is much the same, but the particle effects have been noticeably toned down due to hardware constraints. Not game-breaking but definitely noticeable.

There is a persistent, nagging, little lag skip that continually pops up. Most of the time it isn't a big deal, it happens when you're just wandering and the frame skip doesn't affect anything. Every once in a while though, an enemy is right in your sights and then... just isn't. That can be frustrating.

The analogue sticks on the Vita just aren't made for FPS in my opinion. My large hands have trouble cradling the system, using the shoulder button while deftly manipulating the analogue stick to precisely line up headshots. You CAN adjust the sensitivity of the analogue sticks, which did help quite a bit, but still didn't completely solve the issue. Maybe this is just a personal matter, but I feel like; while on the console I was skillfully dispatching boss level enemies, on the Vita I'm largely at the mercy of luck.

My thumbs also have a tendency to grace the touch screen as I'm moving the analogue stick which typically results in inadvertently throwing a grenade or using a cooldown. The back touch pad isn't bad, but sometimes it feels like you're just slapping the back of the system hoping it registers in time.

Enemy counts have been lowered to accommodate the hardware restrictions, which is fine, but large camps feel noticeably deserted. Even if you hadn't experienced the frantic glee of mowing down waves of enemies on the console, you will still feel like the world is oddly absent of targets.

Lastly, bugs. I've only put about 4 hours into the title so far, but already I've had a full game crash. I have never experienced a game crash for any reason on the Vita until now and I've had it since launch. I also kept receiving Bad Ass ranks but when I went to the menu to use my token, it said I had none. I quit the game for the day, fully exiting out. The next day when I started, all of the sudden I had six unspent Bad Ass tokens. It's the combination of the frame skipping, game crashing and other little things like the Bad Ass tokens not being there that really start to add up to make playing an amazing game a frustrating experience.

Ultimately, I really wanted to love this. I love Borderlands 2 itself. The Vita just doesn't seem to work well for FPS titles in my opinion. Even that I could probably get over if they would've been able to pull off a stable, full-fledged port. However, just because you CAN port a game doesn't mean that you SHOULD if you can't duplicate it exactly. It's not a horrible game, but there are a few issues that would cause some to feel that it is ""broken"". Game crashes on consoles, portable or otherwise, are not acceptable.

**********UPDATE 11/8/2014************

So, despite my frustration with the controls and crashes, I continued to play because it's Borderlands 2 portable. I've experienced 4 game crashes so far. Almost all of them were within an hour and in the same location. I have played several more hours since and experienced no crashes.

I have finally grown accustomed to the controls on the Vita and became quite comfortable with the ""cramped"" controls. Then I got the PDP Trigger Grips and it is now 100 times easier to control. Some people state that they have had issues with the triggers sticking on the trigger grips. I have not, and there are plenty of easy fixes on the web for those that are having issues. Most the time just loosening a couple screws solves the problem. They are an absolute MUST for FPS on the Vita and have increased my enjoyment of Borderlands 2 on the Vita immensely.

After playing the PS3 GOTY edition, I can state that there is a much more noticeable difference graphically between the two. However, the graphics on the Vita are still phenomenal and in no way hinder my desire to play the game. Also, the difference between enemy populations isn't as great as I had initially thought. There are plenty of bandits, robots and skags to shoot on the Vita.

The nuances of Cross-Save deserve their own paragraph and are as follows:
- Golden Keys do not transfer
- Bad Ass skills do not transfer but tokens do, meaning you will have the same rank, but your bonuses may differ from one game to the next.
- Inventory does transfer so anything gained with your Golden Keys will transfer between systems.
- Not all wardrobe options are available on the Vita (I know, no idea why) so your outfit on the PS3 may not be available on the Vita and your appearance will be set to default.
- Cross-Save is not automatic, you must upload your character on one system and download it on the next, then when you're done upload it again, and so on.
- Levels, Money, Eridium all transfer
- When you download your character you can choose a different save slot, either overwriting the existing (outdated) character or keeping that character and using a new slot.

The lag still occurs from time to time, but again it's not game-breaking, just mildly annoying. Overall I'm having a blast with the game and have decided to bump my overall score up to 4 stars. Why not 5??? Because a 5-star rating implies that the game is flawless. Don't get me wrong, the game is still flawed. Frame skipping and the occasional crash are irritating. Weird Cross-Save ommissions and restrictions are flaws, it is 95% the same character but it still is not the same exact copy between versions. However, the game is a blast to play and everything it does right (which IS almost everything) overshadow the minor flaws it does have. This is a 9.5/10 game through and through.",Great game hampered by the hardware. *UPDATED*,1415059200,,,

NOTE: It's been said in other reviews but it bears repeating - this is not a kid's game.

4.0,True,"12 12, 2016",A2XN8YOJ16WAVM,B00BMFIXOW,A. N.,"I played the first and second AC games but never bothered finishing them because they rapidly became insanely boring and repetitive.  Then I took a long hiatus from the series until I decided to give Black Flag a try, several years after it was initially released.  I am very glad that I did.

Black Flag is a vast improvement over the earlier games (at least the first two; I can't speak to the others).  The open world is very fun to explore, and engaging in sea battles and taking prizes is surprisingly amusing.  I have spent hours just sailing around and plundering every ship I can find, taking every fort I come across, and just generally being a pirate.  It never gets old.  The main storyline is solid so far (I haven't quite finished it).  Combat on land seems improved, with a nice mixture of weapons.

That said, some of the same issues that plagued the earlier AC games still exist.  The most serious is the controls.  Just like previous versions, your character will be dashing ahead and then suddenly he'll start climbing up the side of a structure or a wall precisely when you don't want him to.  Or, you want him to climb up something but instead he'll start climbing up and then suddenly will jump off in the opposite direction.  For the most part it's a minor annoyance, but in a few instances (when trying to run from combat, for example) it can become insanely frustrating.  The second huge issue I have with the AC series is the whole stupid animus thing.  It's a dumb concept and it's clunky in execution.  At certain points in the game's progress you'll suddenly be yanked out of your awesome pirate adventure and forced to walk around Abstergo hacking into computers by doing stupid mini-games.  I just want to be a pirate, okay?

Overall, Black Flag has proven to be extremely fun and a worthy time sink.  Like Shadows of Mordor, this is a game that you can have tons of fun just doing side quests and having a good time killing and plundering across the open world.","Avast ye, matey!",1481500800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It feels like they've added a lot of ideas from the recent hit Rayman Jungle Run mobile app to Legends, changing the feel of what might have been a somewhat typical platformer.  They have added JILLIONS of bonus stages, challenges, awards and goals, many of which are speed based.  There's even a Daily Challenge, where you try to accomplish a goal with the best score or time.  It's a lot of content packed in.  There are multiple characters to unlock, along with the stages, adding a bit of variety.  Some of the speed design, and constant retries, reminded me of Runner 2 or Super Meat Boy.

I'll say this though... Legends is HARD.  You could probably plow through most of the stages in a rush, and it would still ramp up the difficulty as you go, but part of the fun is exploring the little nooks and crannys and going after those collectibles that are JUST... OUT...OF...REACH!!! I unlocked several new levels fairly quickly, but was compelled to stay on each level, even on each stage, until I had found every collectible and aced the stage.

For kids, it might be a little on the challenging side, but Legends is constantly rewarding you, and there are more opportunities for success here than in Origins.

The song list has too much crap that really doesn't belong on DDR, which the developers should have sought for a greatest hits version to bring in much more revenue and popularity for the PS3 release. I would have personally been happy with all original songs, and of course the Japanese-Oriented ones that are included. Most the songs from Geisha's Dream down are tolerable DDR songs, but not all of them. Why not put things Like Healing Vision, Sandstorm, Sakura, Ecstasy (Original or midnight blue mix) B4U's challenge version, or any others that veteran steppers love on it? In fact, why are there so few songs on a bluray, when there are so many more on DVD disks from the PS2? Did the interface, and HD quality take up all the space? If so, why not make a large pack of songs to release at a fair price? Hell, if you aren't even going to make anymore DDR's for the PS3, why not make a few packs containing every song ever made for a fair price? Overall, the game does have fun songs, the display quality is good, and it does include a calorie counter which can be questionable at times.

The graphics. They're the best yet of the series and the characters look 3D while still retaining their 2D spirit. Street Fighter wasn't meant to be played in 3D and gladly, they keep this tradition going. There's one word for the graphics: spectacular.

The sound. Surround sound ensures that you hear the hits connecting all around you, especially when an ultra combo is involved.

The characters. Some of them are kinda goofy but for the most part, just about all the characters you know and love return. Fans of Street Fighter 2 will be the most pleased I think. You get 16 to start but that number grows once you unlock the rest. Actually, I have a bone to pick regarding the final boss but I'll save that for later.

Unlockables. Lots of stuff to unlock, guaranteeing multiple playthroughs. You can also download costumes online.... for a fee of course.

THUMBS IN BETWEEN TO:

The gameplay. It's classic Street Fighter with a couple of additions to it, namely Ultra Combos and Focus Attacks. I think for the most part this game plays well with the standard Xbox 360 gamepad but some of those specials are nearly impossible to pull off in the heat of battle with it. This game practically cries for the arcade joystick but the question remains: Do you really want to drop that much cash on a joystick, no matter how well made it is?

Online play. For the most part, its lag free and controls quite well. Still, you'll have to contend with some pretty cheesy tactics from online players. No different from playing the game at your local arcade except now you can get cheesed in the comfort of your own home.

THUMBS DOWN TO:

Seth, the final boss. Wow. I mean, it's Street Fighter and I expect a little bit of cheese but this character is literally one of the biggest blocks of pure cheddar that I have ever faced. This guy does things that are so unfair that it almost feels like a joke that you're not in on. And he looks like a cross between the Silver Surfer and Dr. Manhattan from the Watchmen, only with a spinning Yin-Yang in his midsection. I didn't feel like he was too inspired in all honesty and his cheesy nature just makes me want to throw my controller through the screen, Wii-remote style.

Anime cut scenes. Badly produced with horrendous voice acting. Thankfully you can switch the voiceovers to Japanese but c'mon its Street Fighter! The series that took everyone's money for years! You mean to tell me that they couldn't have delivered some slick anime type deals to head and tail each characters storylines with some decent work?

VERDICT:

I'd recommend this game as it caters to both the newbie and the expert Street Fighter player. The CPU can be downright ridiculous even at the medium levels though to that point where we've all reached, where we look up at the ceiling and ask, ""What is it you want from me, huh? My blood? My life? My firstborn?!?""

Still, the game is loads of fun to play and offers some very decent online play to boot. The graphics and effects are fantastic and on the right setup provides a visual and aural feast. Just be prepared to keep from chucking your controller once Seth comes around.",Give and receive some serious beatdowns,1235865600,32,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"08 11, 2007",AKMJJES6FE2M5,B000EPP6UA,Andrew C.,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this game after learning that it was a port of a console game. Also, I hadn't played any of the past Resident Evil games.  However, if you own a gamepad (especially an XBox 360 controller), Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth the price.  It's a game of the horror/survival genre and packs in a lot of good scares and clever adventuring. It does have a few problems, but overall, I had a blast!

Gameplay: In a nutshell, you are a U.S. government agent sent to rescue the president's daughter from a evil cult in Europe.  There are some minor intrigues going on and you'll likely get confused about whose working for whom, but for the most part this is a simple rescue/save-the-world mission. Your travels will take you through villages, an abandoned hospital, factories, sewers, a castle, and an island.  The diversity of environments is actually impressive.  There is some good loot to be found, but most of it is simply meant to allow you to buy better weapons from strategically placed weapons dealers.  And you'll have fun enough using the weapons, trust me. With a XBox 360 gamepad, this game plays well.  It's one of those games truly meant to be placed with a gamepad, thus I can excuse the lack of mouse support (though it really should have been supported).

The game offers a lot of good, creepy action, and there are no less than 10 great boss fights.  Some of the fights are frustrating and will require repeated efforts.  However, they are all satisfying and leave you with a sense of accomplishment when completed.  The game lasted me about 30 hours (according to the in-game timer); however, it's actually longer than that if you count all of the saved games that you'll have to reload after dying (and you'll die many, many times), along with the bonus missions unlocked after completing the main game.  For the bargain price of $20 or less, it's money well spent if you are a fan of adventure and/or horror games.

Graphics: This is a mixed bag.  You can adjust the resolution, and the game looks very good at 1600x1200.  Character models are done well, though at least 75% of the opponents you'll meet will be zombies and cultists.  Most of the cutscenes are not impressive at all and were not apparently touched up as the game was being set up for the PC.  Still, the graphics are immersive and set the appropriate foreboding atmosphere.

Sound: The audio is creepy when it needs to be and sedate at other times. Really nothing special.  There is some music in the game, but usually it's the kind of hurried ochestral stuff that typically plays in horror movies to get your pulse up.  Voices of main characters--as well as their looks--are rather juvenille, which takes some of the seriousness out of the subject matter.

Technical issues: The game comes with a thin, but functional manual.  There is no tutorial level as far as I can recall, but you'll learn the controls quickly.  The game did hard lock my computer about five times, requiring me to reboot my PC.  I consider this a serious technical issue, in addition to the few times it crashed to desktop.  Still, I could usually play at least 3 hours straight before any problems occurred. I assume a patch could fix this.  The game has an auto-save system, but it works pretty decently since it saves at a lot of different checkpoints.

Replay/value: For the price that I paid for this ($17.99), the game was definitely worth the money.  However, I'm not one to replay a game that will have the same story line and ending, so I didn't find much replay value here.  In sum, if you like a good scare with some wild-side adventuring, Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth a try.

Pros:
+Creepy and immersive gameplay
+Great weapons, with many upgrades
+Some fun puzzles and well-done levels
+30 solid hours of gameplay at a cheap price

It is a platform but in the lightest sense. It has plenty of different games, and different types of graphics, but as a whole, to me it has always acted as an add-on to the already uber-cool Sega Genesis platform.

If you are a newcomer and have never experienced the Sega in the 90s, or are unfamiliar with the Genesis or the 16-bit era as a whole, chances are you will be disappointed in the Sega CD Console.

Why? The graphical interface is not like your Xbox. It is often cheap 3D, pasted-on, with lots of oddities here and there. Occasionally you can find a truly remarkable game that looks beautiful in every way - Sonic CD, Phantasy Star.

However, on the other hand, if you remember the early 90s, you will not continue to see a shoddy, run-down graphical interface. You will see and experience nostalgia.

For me it was the 2nd grade, every Saturday going to Video World to rent one title for the weekend, video card and cool chain eagle wallet in hand, and the smell of fresh hot popcorn and subs next door filled the air. The floor was a creaky, crooked floor, and the store was manned by a single, quiet clerk reading a book behind the desk. Passing by all of the vhs and laserdisc racks, I made my trek all the way to the back where they had the ""VIDEO GAMES"" sign in the corner and about 50 titles on silly red wired storage racks.

There was no such things as Xbox or Playstation. There were Super Nintendo, Sega, and Sega CD Games. Incredibly simple.  All of the art had been printed on copy paper in black and white. So cheap, but so inviting.

In those days Sega CD seemed so exquisite simply because they were on shiny discs. Discs were something fairly new and it wasn't something you'd throw around like a cartridge. Handle it by the edges, ok, will do, and put in the case as soon as you are done playing, check.

Though not breathtaking in the least by today's gaming standards, it remains a milemarker in time where cartridges were at the dawn of becoming an alternative in home video gaming.

4.0,False,"03 21, 2009",A2BSRSOG7B2RSI,B0012N94WO,Mr. H. C. Orr,"When ""Resident Evil 4"" appeared in 2004, first on the Gamecube and then on the PlayStation 2, it was a miracle of reinvention for a series badly in need of one.  The over-the-shoulder view replaced the isometric backdrop of the previous games, but the new format retained enough of the old flavour -and not to mention control scheme- to make it feel like a classic Resi game.  ""Resident Evil 5"" is simply an expertly-made, online-enabled and often lushly-presented continuation of this trend,.  Although this really comes as no surprise, the series is starting to show its age, and Resi 5 should be seen as an action game for Resi fans rather than the new, younger breed of game fans raised on titles such as ""Gears Of War"" 1 and 2, and first-person shooters.

Resi 5 is what you would expect from a top-tier game made by Capcom: good graphical presentation, wonderful character animation in cut scenes, wooden characters, a story and dialogue that appears to have been written on a napkin in a  lunch break, predictable set-pieces and huge, ridiculous boss fights.  In short, a general air of competent, don't-wreck-a-selling-formaula malaise hangs over the whole production.

The much-vaunted graphical rehash is pretty impressive, although the backgrounds still retain the pre-rendered vibe of classic Resident Evil games.  The detail, right from dust, detail on brickwork, lens flare and little bugs scurrying around the environments, to partner Sheva Alomar's bronzed skin and Chris Redfield's rippling biceps is impressive. However, the very contrasty colour palette remains a constant issue: dark colours constantly bleed into lighter colours, presumable in an effort to replicate the blinding, enervating sunlight of Africa.  There is also a nagging air of inconsistency and laziness in some of the presentation, compared to other stunning games I have played recently, such as ""Killzone 2"".

One of the main selling points of the game is the presence of a partner.  While this wrecks any real sense of terror, it provides ample opportunity for an on- and offline co-op mode.  Co-op is tremendous fun, although the inability to trade weapons and ammo with online partners in real time is irritating.  Of course, this mode depends on the ability of the person you are playing with, but sometimes you will uncover a new approach to tackling a certain section or even using weapons in the game by watching your partner.

However, the main issue with the game is simply the control scheme.  While Resi 4 could get away with continuing the ponderous and static turn-and-shoot model of the older games, Resi 5 is a next-gen game.  The generally good presentation only goes to highlight the absurdity of a supposedly tough, muscle-bound character being forced to fire weapons while standing still, then turn, run away to reload, and then repeat the process.  The absence of any reliable dodge technique being mapped permanently to a controller button and the still rather ponderous reactions of the controllable characters only add to the irritation.

Perhaps the crux of the new game problem is this: as the game is no longer a survival horror game, with a fully-armed and very capable sidekick at your side virtually the whole time taking much of the horror out of the survival, the vulnerability that comes with this control scheme has disappeared.  The controls now seem slow rather than heightening any tension.

""Resident Evil 5"" is a very good addition to the Resident Evil canon.  It doesn't break any barriers down to those who have always hated Resi games, or to those raised on the run-and-gun masterworks of the last few years, such as the Gears Of War games.  And it certainly doesn't add more than expected to its illustrious predecessor.  Capcom doesn't care, because they have sold millions of units of the game already.  But perhaps this should mark the end of the tank-like control scheme so famous in Resi games.  Running and shooting?  Perhaps Chris, Sheva, et al. need to learn a little multitasking.","Fun, But Offers Nothing New",1237593600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It is, however, important to note that this particular Logitech wheel was specifically designed to be used almost entirely for current and future iterations of the GT game series (the nifty backlit 'GT' logo on the horn should be a dead giveaway) and therefore if your intention is to use this product on other PS3 racing games you won't quite get the same 4-star experience as you would with GT.

With that out of the way, coming out of the box the wheel feels quite sturdy as is the pedal board.  The main hardware components are all quite responsive and unlike many similar products manages to stay grounded in place no matter how hard you think you are pushing it.  The wheel itself is capable of a very smooth 900 degree rotation and the contextual force feedback is accurate and greatly enhances the overall gameplay experience.  Another great future when used with 'GT' is the hardware addition of a real-time adjustment dial allowing you to tweak settings as you'd like on the fly, in the middle of your game.

Some minor caveats - shifting is counter-intuitive as the device requires you to up-shift to drop gears and vice versa.  Also, as mentioned above this product doesn't function quite as smoothly when used with non 'GT' driving games.  There is a fairly comprehensive option menu that allows you to adjust the wheel for other games but it is a rather long process and will take awhile to get the proper setup in place.  That said, if 'GT' is your thing the wheel is a terrific complement that will greatly enhance your 'GT' sessions.",4-star product if used with GT5P only,1218499200,,,

Alone,on myst island, you must discover the locationn of ""linking books"".  These linking books transport you to other ""ages"" where you are in search of red and blue pages.  The pages must be returned to their books in the island library- each time you do this, you learn more and more of the story.

Graphics-wise, it's the best game of this type I've seen or played - in terms of the puzzles, the comic book style introduction to each chapter, and the full-blown animation present at the beginning and end of the game as a whole.  Basically, you're helping a young couple - and the strange little ghost hunter who mysteriously turns up at their door - to find and trap the myriad of ghosts haunting their home.  Among all of the hidden objects you have to find across 30 unique rooms are the components the weird ghost hunter will use to trap the main spirits haunting each section.  You are also called upon to discover a number of lesser (and much more comical) spirits along the way.  The music and ambient sounds actually add to the experience, especially the dark ghostly chuckle you hear when you've found objects that will be used to trap a particular ghost.  Mishap also comes with as diverse a set of mini-games as you're likely to find in a game such as this - some are more enjoyable and challenging than others, but they are all optional for the player.  The game also comes with some extra features to make the whole experience a little more amusing - for every one of the pesky ghosts you're trapping, there's a funny story behind his/her demise.  Heck, the storyline of the game even throws in a surprise twist at the very end.

I must admit, however, that I experienced some annoying technical problems that had a definite negative impact on my game experience.  After I completed the first two chapters, I was forced to endure a horrible and constant roar coming out of my speakers.  I could still make out the words and music on top of the sound, but it was a really annoying problem.  Sometimes it would clear itself up for a chapter ending or maybe even an entire chapter, but it always came back with a vengeance at some point.  I could find no problem with my sound settings, and reinstalling the game accomplished nothing in this regard.  That being the case, I have to lower my rating a little bit - but I still consider this a must-have item for hidden object game enthusiasts.","A fantastic game marred, at least in my case, by some technical problems",1297555200,2,,

This one luckily falls into the good category while having a few downsides which let it down but don't ruin the experience.

Pro's
The open world nature of Spiderman means you can go pretty much anywhere and with little to no pop in from buildings and textures it handles the vertical perspectives well.
It is easy to get a hang of moving Spidey around but takes some practice to use his more advanced abilities to get where you want to go quickly.
The comic book scraps are a great addition, collecting all the scraps opens the comic for you to read in the front end including the first Spiderman appearance. Better than a lot of collection items in games which don't really contribute to anything other than an achievement.

Con's
The cut scene close ups of characters leave a bit to be desired and aren't up there with the current releases focusing on realism. The models look dated and clunky but get the job done of telling their story.
The controls can be one of the more frustrating things about the game, trying to pinpoint your landing and overshooting it only to web sling back past where you want to land.
It is a little bit repetitive, go complete an objective, go back to your apartment, go complete next objective, go back to your apartment etc. All while collecting comic book scraps.",Good Spiderman game but could be better,1343001600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's fun, and it's a good fit for the DS (you click on the objects with your stylus when you find them). The pictures are generally well done, although sometimes it can be frustrating when you click on an object and the game doesn't register your click (presumably because you're clicking on the wrong pixel).

The mini-games, such as putting together a jigsaw puzzle, playing mahjongg tiles or playing concentration, are fun enough when they come between the find-the-object puzzles, as part of the main game. You can also unlock them to play them on their own, and I found them far too easy to be entertaining for very long in that mode.

Seriously, if you can play for even 1 hour without running into a typo, grammatical error, or text glitch, you are very lucky. Here's a few samples of the typoes that I can recall off the top of my head... When you buy a Recovery Potion from the Hospital (for 3 Herbs and 300g), after the potion is mixed up, the game tells you that you got an Insect Skin (instead of a Recovery Potion). When you give a Sweet Potato to Rosalind, she calls you Aaron (even though your name is Kyle). Apparently the translation team had trouble agreeing on what to call some of the items. Several items are referred to by multiple names (Ex: Sweet Potatoes and Yams).

The ""my game slows down when I'm in my barn or on the docks"" glitch is graphical lag. If 4 or more characters/monsters are on the screen at one time, the game slows to a crawl. It's like super slow-motion! The whole game lags noticably compared to Rune Factory 1 (which runs very fast), but when you get multiple characters in the same screen, the game grinds nearly to a halt. Mayhap the graphics engine could have done with a bit more debugging.

That being said, there are good parts, too. There is more story and text, the ability to choose your gender in the 2nd part of the game, the monster AI has been seriously upgraded, the game is more challenging (which is nice for those of us who beat RF1 in less than a year of game time), the scene backdrops are amazing, and the opening song is very nicely sung and animated.

In short, if the lag doesn't bother you too badly, it's a nice game. It could have used more polishing and debugging before being released, though.

All these things hold true in BS2. In fact, the games are so similar that I'm glad I didn't play BS2 right after the original despite buying them together. Combat's been refined a bit with the pretty workable two hands (one for your weapons and one for your plasmids (spells)) system. A few new foes like the Brute Splicer have arrived, and there's a new adversary ruling Rapture, but everything feels very much the same as in BioShock 1 (which is a good thing). On the game's merits, I'd give it five stars and say that the only problem is that BioShock 1 set the bar so high for any sequel to match.

I'm taking a star off because even though I bought the downloadable version and registered with Steam (which I accept) I *also* had to go through stupid Windows Live which kept notifying me that it had lost the connection and gone into offline mode (although my computer never lost internet), disrupting the game at very inopportune times (without pausing it so I was still getting shot at but couldn't respond).

Capcom are the innovators of taking a game and riding its gravy train until  the biscuit wheels turn into soft, vanilla-paste-looking mush.  Not that  there's anything wrong with that, mind, but almost any company can do it.  The trick is doing it well.  And Capcom have, with an amalgamation of every  single ""Vs."" game they've ever put together packaged into one  single, dare I say it, button-mashing frenzy.  Name a character from a  ""Vs."" game, and he/she is in there, from ""X-Men: Children of  the Atom"" on through.  All together, a whopping roster of 56 fighters  in all (once they're all unlocked), split down the middle with 28 on  Marvel's side and 28 busting heads for Capcom.  And just to keep it  intriguing, they've included two brand-new characters on each side making  their first Capcom appearance (Ruby Heart and Amingo for Capcom, Cable and  Marrow for Marvel), all of which are interesting to play and look at  ('specially when Marrow rolls her bones).  Visually, the game is stunning  of course, with all-new 3-D looking backgrounds and some new character  animations.  Many of the super-moves are brilliant and hurt just to watch.  Gameplay and control are dead-on; nice and tight as usual, and even  beginners will get an occasional win from pure button-pressing.  56  characters means that everyone will find a comfortable combo to use, as  they each have 3 different assists as well.

But  all in all, a very impressive show from Capcom, even if it's been done  before.  Beat 'em up fans will LOVE this one.  I'd recommend it to any  fighter.

My only real complaint is the story. It starts out great, but then as it progresses the characters literally just say ""OMG its frustrating having magic powers and having to fight stuff."" over and over and over. Its like someone wrote half a script with a bunch of [Insert dramatic scene showing their frustration] written in it to come back to later then ran out of time and decided they should just say they are frustrated in each one rather than show it. And the ending is really bad.. events just get very random and for the most part unsatisfying.

Side quests are also really lame, which is odd considering it is the only open world part. They basically only exist to make you explore. Its all just to go fight some monster, usually its easier and more simplistic than what you fought getting to it as well. They also have really epic fights earlier on in the main story and then those all disappear and the trash becomes harder than bosses. Its hard to take a Fal'Cie as a serious villain when a giant bird is tougher than it.

It has all of the elements that made the former releases a success (I've played them all since HoMM ""1""), but a few of the changes may not be as exciting as they sounded before release.  Heroes are now a major part of your armies.. this is good, and adds some new elements to the game, but on the other hand, building that killer team of creatures isn't as important anymore.  Many times, I had groups of heroes stomping down the lands without opposition.  Early on, it's too easy to lose a hero (and often the scenario), but later the heroes are too powerful, and there is little need to attain that angel or phoenix to top off your ""killer troop"".  I also found much of the early campaign scenarios too easy.  You meet the computer months into the scenarios, and the AI teams have barely built anything, whereas in Heroes 3, they had been hoarding armies for weeks and were very powerful.  It's almost as if the game is on ""pause"" for the AI players while you build up.
Some of the new elements are nice - quests within the scenarios, quest NPCs and extra ""things to do"".  The land is literally saturated with things to visit and level up your heroes, it's almost TOO much.  NWC streamlined some of the towns; instead of having 8 and confusing the heck out of you, there's only 6 more distinctive towns, with a specific magic type assigned to them (order, chaos, nature, etc..)  The towns coincide with some of the magical paths you took in Might and Magic 8, and make more sense.  There are now ""technology trees"" in each town, where you must choose what direction you want to build (go for angels.. or champions? - you can't do both in the same town).  One thing I really like is the addition of caravans to automatically send troops from town to town without having to manually march them down the map, or hire a hero to lead them.  One thing I miss, are the hexes in combat mode.. It's hard to tell where your troops are moving (unless I just overlooked something).
The graphics are, of course, top notch and beautiful.  The music is once again astounding, with choruses of angels and operatic chants.  They make you feel like you are wandering through an elven land in The Lord of the Rings.  All the M&M games have had simply some of the best music in gaming..
All in all, HoMM4 is worth the price, but I hope they address some of the simplistic AI in a patch, and maybe tone down the heroes some (they can learn WAY too many skills now, and there are now 5 levels as well, topping out at grandmaster).

I first beat this game when it originally came out for the Gamecube.  So about a month ago I decided to put it in again and play it.  Maybe the fact that they are remaking it in HD gave me some motivation to check it out again.

First of all, I still think the graphics looks beautiful, even in non-HD format.  I don't think it is the best Zelda graphical style, but they did a good job with it.  I especially like the expressions on Links face.  Seeing him laugh makes it even more fun.  After playing a little bit I forgot that the controls are a little clumsy at times.  It seems to be annoying that the camera is facing the wrong way sometimes.  Maybe I'm use to the newer games where the controls and camera angles seem to be better.

I really think the first half of this game is great.  I really enjoy the dungeons and I like the building up of the story line.  The part that gets me is having to go get the triforce maps and then get the shards.  It just seems like a tedious task without any of the fun of playing any dungeons.

Also, another gripe I have with this game is that it is wayyyy too easy.  I know Zelda games typically aren't that hard, but you have to be really bad to actually die in this game.  It's just way too easy.

On another positive note, the music is some of the best from any Zelda game.  I won't be getting the HD remake, but I really hope they release an orchestrated version of all the music throughout the game.

So playing video games in class (I'm not a good role model) and getting good grades wasn't very hard. This game, while grindy and sometimes downright tedious, really did help turn countless hours from sitting down and doing absolutely nothing to being something somewhat productive.

I've been a fan of Etrian Odyssey for years, and while I didn't play the mainline Mystery Dungeon games, I do like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. This game does a good job of combining the class elements and the western/eastern rpg mixture elements of Etrian Odyssey into the random dungeon exploration of Mystery Dungeon.

The composer for the music of this game was Yuzo Koshiro, and while the soundtrack is mostly a remastered album of some of his previous works in the Etrian Odyssey series, it's so good that I'll stop playing the game altogether just to take in the soundtrack.

Again, this game does have a lot of grinding, and it's not the most balanced game either.

Preface:
If you have not played Mass Effect 1, play it to the finish and keep a saved game before playing Mass Effect 2. Your character and many of your decisions throughout that game persist into the world of Mass Effect 2 which greatly enhances the game world.

Warining:
This game is rated M for a reason. You are able to avoid the unsatisfactory bits of the game (more easily than in the original as well), but parents should read more about the content of this game before purchasing it or allowing it to be purchased.

Pros:
- Awesome integration with Mass Effect 1 save games (see above)
- Beautiful Graphics
- Combat feels a lot better and more fun than it did in the original
- Great characters and voice acting. I had Mordin Sollus on my team the entire game not because I valued him in combat but because he was such an entertaining character to have around. The other characters are great too, including many of the major NPCS - particularly Martin Sheen and Seth Green's characters.
- The Normandy. Despite the loading times when moving up / down decks, the Normandy feels like a state of the art starship and a real place. Walking into CIC I felt like I was on Battlestar Galactica (though that could be because Trica Heffner voice acts the Normandy's computer systems)
- Conversational interrupts are nice, though the game needed more opportunities for them.
- More inhabited space stations / planets than the original, though still felt like there should be at least one more major location.

Cons:
- The universe feels slightly smaller despite it being around the same size. The Mako landing sequences are gone and are replaced with scanning planets from orbit. Sure navigating terrain with the Mako could be annoying, but it made the original game feel epic.
- Too few variants of each weapon / not enough items. The original had excessive item management and customization. Mass Effect 2 goes near the other extreme in not granting you enough variety in weaponry and armor. It means less work outfitting characters, but the game feels smaller and more limited because of it.
- The story doesn't have the same radical plot twists that the original did and the last boss was lackluster as a concept and as a battle. It's not a bad story / setting - it just doesn't live up to the standards of the original
- Not enough side quests.
- Not enough opportunities to use your paragon / renegade score to influence conversations.
- Felt a little too short
- Weapon overheating was replaced with clips and very limited ammo for the sniper rifles. As a sniper I was forced to use a weaker sniper rifle with more ammo (defeating much of the purpose of a sniper rifle) or use a stronger sniper rifle and hope I don't bump into more than 10 enemies in a room.

Bottom Line:
- Fun game with a great setting. Story and roleplaying could be better, but they were both acceptable. Has many improvements over the original but also loses some of the grand scope and roleplaying the original had. Overall, probably a better game, but aspects are worse.","Shiny, better combat than 1 but worse story and roleplaying",1266710400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

While it is geared towards younger players, it's certainly not a child's RPG and will appeal to older gamers as well who grew up playing RPG's in the 8 and 16 bit era.

The only two complaints I've really heard people gripe about for this game is that the story is cliche and it doesn't offer anything new. I agree to a point, the storline is cliche, but it is still full of plot twists and has a rather flushed out story. True, the characters aren't really flushed out, but the story of the gameworld and its inhabitants is. While the game is totally turn based, a majority of the story oddly takes place via numerous in-game and cutscene action sequences. There always seems to be something flashy and exciting going on, so if that talkes the place of flushed out characters, it's almost an even tradeoff. The gameplay doesn't offer much new either, but it does do things other RPG's have done before better. Getting enemies to battle eachother really helps your party out in battles. Another cool thing is almost every rock, tree, table, cable, etc., anything casual lying around has items or gold in them. Sometimes you'll even find experience points lying in places, and I've never seen that before. The boss battles are awesome as well, and they can be a bit tough unless you know their weaknesses. Most bosses are tough to beat if you simply attack and attack, they usually have numerous weak points you should try and exploit.

There are a few things I didn't like. One is that the in-game tutorial doesn't explain very well how to do some things. Like I thought you had to equip Lv. 2 Lv. 3, etc. skills in your basic skill slots to use lv. 2, lv. 3 spells, but I figured out later on you can just automatically use then as soon as you're alerted of the fact you acquired that skill. The other problem I had was the uneven difficulty of the enemeis. Some areas had mosnters so tough that every battle was a tough fight, then the next area would be full of enemies that I could plow through with no problem.

In the end, I think most people say they don't like this game simply because they played the awful demo. The demo dropped you into the middle of things with no backstory, not much interaction and a sense of being lost. I really love this game, and I find it kind of odd that I was looking forward more to Eternal Sonata, but everywhere is giving Blue Dragon a higher score.

4.0,False,"10 15, 2009",A9R6Z1PMRJ0BV,B000O5FULU,Twins Dad,"Blacksite: Area 51 has the kind of ""I wonder what's going to pop out at me around the next corner"" suspense that was so sorely lacking in RE5. In fact, I found this game to be so much MORE ""engaging"" than popular titles like RE5 and MGS4. Oddly enough, I believe some of the ""flaws"" like framerate drops and frequent 2-3 sec gameplay pauses for in-game loads actually CONTRIBUTED to this ""Fear Factor"", albeit unintentionally. It may not be the popular opinion here, but this was a DECENT SHOOTER as far as I'm concerned...

So much of a game like this hinges on controls for me...Are they spot-on or do they suck? This game has really TIGHT controls and that definitely gets on my good side. I actually got used to the video problems rather quickly because I was drawn into the gameplay. But I can also see how it could be a problem for some who can't avoid focusing on the flaws while playing. I was simply too busy bustin' alien arse to get caught up on those things. I imagine one's experience with this game will be positive or negative based primarily on how much the video problems are allowed to distract one from gameplay.

I played this game in 2 days on Hard difficulty, which equals maybe 8 or 9 hours...So it's a pretty quick one. However, I also found myself trying to squeeze in every free minute to jump back into the fray! There are some parts that are sufficiently challenging and you'll find your character repeatedly dying until you improve your skills enough to get to the next level. I like that in a game, and this one really seems to have it in just the right dosage. The game also quickly progresses through a surprising number of environments for such a short game. It's too varied to ever feel repetitive.

The voice talent was excellent, another pleasant surprise. Sound was also very well done...And when combined with the vibration feedback of the DualShock 3, grabbing one of the fixed machine gun turrets and mowing down approaching aliens was just a flat out 10 out of 10 experience in this game! The weapons are excellent with the trusty old carbine being the most used, the sniper rifle the most fun (especially when taking down the chopper), the pulse rifle the most devastating and the ""scatter gun"" the most disappointing. It only took me a couple of times to figure out the scatter gun is a good and quick way to get your character killed. MOST ammo is plentiful, meaning carbine ammo...But I wish there were more grenades placed throughout because they were fun and effective. Once you run out of them you may not find any more for quite some time. Also, each time you get the anti-tank weapon, there's only ONE rocket with it when you actually need more...Or at least it would be more fun to repeatedly fire off more rounds and blow stuff up.

Blacksite: Area 51 has a good variety of enemies, and LOTS OF THEM! At times it felt like a Call of Duty title because the aliens seemed like they'd never stop coming. It also has the Squad Command feature of Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 allowing you to send your buddies into the unknown so you can safely see what's what before you get your head blown off. Another thing I liked was how an enemy's weapon would ""levitate"" above the ground after you waste them so you could easily see where more ammo was in the heat of battle...A nice touch!

There are some things I would change. For example, driving a vehicle is insanely difficult simply because the rt stick not only steers the vehicle but it also changes camera perspective at the same time...WTH?!? Imagine trying to drive an arcade racer without a fixed view behind the vehicle. Instead, every time you turn left or right your view also swings to the left or right behind the vehicle WHILE THE VEHICLE IS TURNING! How on Earth could a developer let something like this slip by?!? Just TERRIBLE! But that is my biggest gripe. There were a good many things that were done RIGHT in this game...

It comes across as one of those games that ran out of development time and was rushed to market without needed polish...The kind of polish that could've made Blacksite: Area 51 a true 5-star title. And that's a real shame because it makes it so easy for someone to give this game a 1, 2 or 3-star review with sufficient justification. But if you can train yourself to more or less IGNORE the periodic freeze frames and just focus on alien-busting, then it's the kind of game that has enough going for it to produce 4 or 5-star gaming reviews, again with justification. I have no problem rating this game a SOLID 4-STARS myself, but I can't give it that extra nudge specifically because of the video problems, horrible vehicle physics and overall lack of polish that makes a 5-star game what it is...A seamless and continuously enjoyable gaming experience.

I also HAVE to recommend any game that has me so hooked that I'm looking for every free minute I can find to pick up the controller and play more and more and more...","OK, So It's Flawed...But I Still Couldn't Put It Down!!",1255564800,11,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I cannot go into too much detail other than, stick with it even if it seems weird at first, but the game play and story get better and it turns out to be a great action game. I like the fact that they tried to be different, and it pays off. I played the game on Normal, and took me about 10 hours to complete, great for a rainy weekend.

The landscapes and textures are simply gorgeous in this, but I think I like Far Cry 3 a little better. It's a personal thing: Far Cry 3 was set in the islands with a tropical environment but FC4 is set in Tibet I think, where it's cold (or ""looks"" cold). I don't like the cold. Also, in FC3, it's like the main character transformed from a regular young guy into a killer and his friends didn't know he was capable of such a transformation. There was just more tension. In this game (part 4), it seemed like the main character was already some kind of soldier or something with special training. Plus he was alone with no friends to see him become somebody dangerous and relentless.

Now, there was a level ( or a couple of levels) in the game that were just...ridiculous to me. Psychedelic levels with tie-dye colors and chakra colors.

It wasn't a complete lie however; I did have a meeting, a meeting with Ryu Hayabusa.

This game is bloody, the major selling point of the game and I absolutely love it. The bone-crunching, flesh-slicing action is intense and fast, and unlike anything in previous hack n slash games. Both graphics and audio are tip top, and the controls are smooth and responsive.

One function I particularly like is the convenient weapons and item menu that can be easily accessed in the middle of heavy combat. This is important, as enemies outnumber you 6 to 1, you will inevitably take some pounding and as your health drops to dangerous levels, you can immediately hit the D-pad to consume various herbal remedies to stay alive. Furthermore, you can switch weapons in the middle of a fight - so if you've been clobbering some poor dude for half a minute with your Lunar Staff and want to finish him off by slicing his throat from ear to ear, you can do that by switching to your Dragon Sword.

Concerning the difficulty, the hand-to-hand combat is very fierce and gets a little overwhelming at times; typically enemies attack in waves and by the time you're done with half of them, not much of your health may be left. The good news is that dead enemies' souls help restore health. The AI is pretty smart and injured enemies adjust their AI from aggressive to sneaky and psychotic - just waiting for you to turn your back and plunge that sword or talon through your chest. So remember - don't expect an enemy with only one arm left to just happily sit there, finish off him.

Unlike a lot of other games, bodies of dead enemies don't disappear off the screen, so bodies, limbs and chunks of bloody meat litter all over the ground after you've been through a wave of attackers, this is nice effect.

Also, blocking in this game is like taking cover in Gears of War, you can't do without it. Yet, while blocking you can either execute a counter attack after the enemy has finished his moves or dash away to escape. So, there is a huge number of fighting techniques and tactics that you can experiment with. Other aspects of the game are pretty conventional and straight forward - occasional save and heal points in the form of a dragon statue, a shop to purchase weapons and items, boss battles (which will REALLY test your wits and reflexes) etc. There isn't too much of a learning curve (which is good), all you need is to come to grips with the pace, various combos and pick out your favorite techniques.

This is one of the best games on the 360 ever, right up there with Gears and Devil May Cry; NG2 certainly edges Devil in the fighting department. For those into achievements, NG2 provides some 60 achievements, and what's fun is the ease of gaining achievements - you can earn achievements just by discovering and executing new skills, but as expected they are valued at only 5 gamescore points each. By the time I completed the first level, I've gained 11 achievements.

I knocked one star off because of camera issues, although awkward angles can be easily fixed by hitting the right trigger. Also, frame rates aren't entirely smooth and tend to slow down at various points, but this isn't too big a problem. Some levels will come across as just plain and ugly, and it seems level designers were lazy in this respect.

Another problem is the 'cheapness' of the levels, as others have mentioned, for example frequent and unexplained explosions on certain levels drain away your health - a clear indication that level designers were too damn lazy to think of challenges to test your skill.

But my biggest problem with NG2 is that you can't replay past missions, that is a real disappointment as mission replays are crucial to the replay value of the game.

Overall this is a great game, certainly an intense experience; as an above-average difficult game, you can feel satisfied that you'll fight many enemies and bosses many times before finishing the game, so getting your money's worth.",Bloody ultraviolence at its best,1212624000,3,,

I find the additions of character tag teaming, the special moves and the over the top ""riot like"" action in arcade mode exhilarating (it actually make me laugh like a kid, cool as can be).

The Not so good- combo action sequence- I keep pressing buttons and the controller just doesn't recognize the command. So it is really frustrating. So, so much for combos. Second the last big battle for arcade is a big let down, I don't even know who the big boss is. I really enjoyed the Konquest in Mortal Kombat- I haven't seen the story mode on this game. So I don't even know how the suppose two worlds came together and what the whole point of the game is, story wise. On the other hand Mortal kombat Deception had an incredible story mode as did MK Armaggedon their story modes were lengthy and action packed. So this game strikes me as just a bunch of Arcade mode fights, and practice/achievement modes. There are no mini games. Again the MK series Deception had Chess and

+Weapons and armor can be modified. Most modifications will change the appearance. The modifications have significant impact.
+During conversations, you can move around. By interacting again, you'll go back into the cinematic mode.
+Power armor. You feel POWERFUL in that piece of equipment. They don't restrict it to ""heavy"" armor experts anymore ensuring everyone can use it. It's more like a vehicle than an armor.
+Building settlements is fun. I've spent way too much time already.
+Legendary enemies. They keep you on your toes and will offer some fantastic rewards.
+Radiation Storms. Foggy, green, and lightning.
+Perk system. It replaces the old skill system and allows for a wide range of customization and play styles. While not as clean as Skyrim's to navigate, I love the update here.

Things I don't like:
-Stiff facial animations, wooden character movement. The lips will move but the face remains stiff, creating awkward looking dialogue cinematics.
-Dated graphics. Some of the textures are amazing. I've ran into some really low resolution (some look straight out of Xbox/Playstation 2 generation). I've also run into an LOD (level of detail) distance rendering bug at some quarry - the textures didn't switch over and it looked like Minecraft... it also created a veneer over the actual terrain causing me to fall through the textures and have difficulty navigating.
-Companions are very powerful, even on the harder settings. I play on the harder settings and I can sit back and let my companions take over 90% of fights. The only times I need to help is if there is a legendary or particularly strong enemy.
-The difficulty of combat situations span a huge gulf. It can go from a pathetically easy encounter to nearly impossible one minutes later.
-Bugs, bugs, bugs. I had high hopes that after 6 years they would have ironed out more of the basic, common bugs. Unfortunately I was wrong.

Neutral/No Opinion:
*Has many Skyrim like features including harvesting, interactive loads screens.
*Looks exactly like previous Fallout games. Some minor differences, but you've seen this wasteland before.

It's easy to get caught up in wandering and exploring. I find myself enjoying the discoveries and finding new weapons, armor, and items. Settlements are a fun addition, though I hope there is more to them later. This is definitely not a game of the year contender by any means. However, it's still a ton of fun and if you're a Fallout fan, you'll enjoy going back into the wasteland.

I've seen super positive and super negative reviews. This is not a 5/5 or a 9/10 out of 10 that I've seen professionals give. It's also not a 1/5 or 4.7 on Metacritic. This is most assuredly a 4 out of 5.","Not Game of the Year, but Extremely Fun Regardless",1447200000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was a little skeptical when I picked up the game as my FIRST Nintendo DS game, but it certainly delivered what was promised.  It's not the most ""authentic"" Guitar Hero experience, but it's just enough to get your rythym based, portable game fix.

The game offers a decent mix of 25 different songs, most of them original recordings.  The recordings are decent, although they are best enjoyed via headphones - even cheaper, MP3 player headphones sounded better than the DS's small speakers.  Graphically the game is not too impressive but in all fairness it doesn't make a huge difference as you'll probably be focused entirely on the stream of green, red, yellow, and blue buttons to see the clunky looking avatars.

The game's difficulty ranges from laughably easy (even on hard) to frustratingly difficult.  The reason for the latter is due to the inclusion of the ""Guitar Duel"" mode.  The DS version of this feature fully utilizes the DS's stylus and microphone in its ""punishments"" and require more involvement than its console counterpart.  It takes a while, but once mastered I found the Duel mode a lot more interesting than the career mode, which seemed fairly short (only 25 songs, no unlockable songs).

The biggest problem I had with the game was the control system.  Holding the DS will be a preference different for everyone, and doesn't seem that intuitive.  Additionally using the stylus was hit or miss - sometimes it worked flawlessly, other times it never really registered.  This was the biggest reason in my markdown to a 4.

Overall the game is fun, albeit short.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but the game manages to capture some aspects of its full-fledged counterparts admirably.  I recommend the game for anyone who needs to get their GH fix, even while on the road, although if you're looking for very responsive controls or a huge selection of songs you may want to wait for the price to come down a bit.","A little lacking, but otherwise fun diversion/GH fix",1242345600,,,

The story is not the most compelling, but fits in the Mario universe quite well. Its easy to play and fun to play. There is much humor to be had here as many of the ""cutscenes"" are quite hilarious. My only and biggest problem with this game is it is soooooooo easy. For example, towards the end of the game, you will be facing several bosses one after another. (Think ""Victory Road"" in the pokemon games.) Unlike Pokmon however, after each boss fight you automatically get all your health and power back to 100% and have the option to save. I found this unfortunate because you don't get the satisfaction of beating a particularly difficult part. Its not difficult, its incredibly easy. I had bought many many mushrooms (think ""potions"") in anticipation of needing to restore my health since I knew I was coming to the end of the game, and assuming it was going to be much more difficult than the rest of the game.

Just before this happened, the US Army's 33rd Battalion went into the city to help with the evacuation, and hasn't been heard from for six months. Three Delta Force operatives are sent into the city with orders to find out what's going on and report back. What they are embarking on is a journey into the heart of madness, war and death.

Spec Ops: The Line is two things. The first is a fairly standard, cover-based action shooter, in which grim men shoot other grim men in the head with a variety of lethal weapons. The second is a meditation on the soul-destroying nature of war and the psychological trauma that exposure to long periods of violence and mayhem can cause. It's essentially a subversive take on games which apparently seek to glorify war, like the Call of Duty franchise, and instead argues that war is not a cartoon game. Much more than this, the game very deliberately makes itself often uncomfortable to play, to the point where the player may not be having any fun and may want to turn the game off (and, incredibly, the developers have said this is something they deliberately wanted to happen).

The degree to which this works is up for debate. Spec Ops: The Line is an incredibly grim, hard-going game which does not relent on the action or the reflection on the death and slaughter afterwards. Some of the most harrowing scenes I've ever seen in a video game are present here: the scene where your soldiers deploy white phosphorus on an enemy position only to hit a load of sheltering refugees is going to be one of those watershed moments in gaming which people are talking about for years to come (a bit like the 'No Russian' bit of Modern Warfare 2, only not so gratuitous). The game borrows a lot of its atmosphere and tone from the movie Apocalypse Now (and the novel it is based on, Heart of Darkness), but also brings in contemporary imagery from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, particularly those incidents where well-meaning soldiers inadvertently bring about the death of innocent people. At every stage of the game, your character, Walker, makes what appears to be the right decision, but the consequences are almost always shown to be disastrous.

This is both good and bad. Good, because games which challenge and subverts expectations and makes the player incredibly uncomfortable about what's happening are few and far between. If we are to accept that games are art, then games which are 'difficult' to conceptually 'get' are as valid as any 'difficult', art or theme-fuelled film or album is. On this basis, the game is successful because it sets out to do something different and thought-provoking, and does it.

The problem is that the game also does not offer any choice outside of its linear story (aside from a few different endings, which can be replayed easily enough) despite choice being the cornerstone of the entire game's philosophy. You are constantly told that it is your choice, your decision which has brought about disaster, but it isn't. It's Walker's. Walker is the character you are directing through the game, but you aren't really playing him (aside from telling him to shoot Dude A before Dude D in a firefight). You have no choice, you simply have to experience Walker's story and its consequences. Normally in a game this isn't a problem - linear action games are a perfectly fine thing to play and enjoy - but here it jars badly with the game's focus on choice and consequence as a major theme. Giving you real choice and real consequences for those choices would have been the more powerful option...but would have made the game far more difficult to make for the developers, and diluted their point if you simply chose the white hat option throughout the game.

As far as the gameplay goes, Spec Ops is a fairly mediocre shooter. It has a typically badly-designed cover system which sticks you to walls and can be fussy letting you go (especially when a grenade's just landed by your feet). It also does that weird thing of limiting you to just two guns at a time, but then throwing 50,000 enemies at you to kill and then loot, so the attempts to limit your choices of gun and ammo really come to nothing and the game goes to some lengths to ensure there's just the right gun for the job conveniently lying around when you need it. There's also the tradition profusion of cut scenes every 5 minutes or so of gameplay, although the point of the game is more found in the narrative than the gameplay, so this time around it actually works. Graphically the game is not very advanced, but its art direction is astonishing, depicting Dubai as a sort of actually-existing Rapture (from BioShock), a defiant technological challenge against nature. Particularly well-realised are the game's sandstorms, and the one outstanding gameplay moment of the title comes when you have to press through a blinding sandstorm whilst fighting off an enemy attack.

Spec Ops: The Line (***) is a narratively and conceptually bold game, but one that sacrifices - to a certain extent - gameplay on the altar of theme and art. Those who want a fun shooter game are advised to look elsewhere. Those who want to see an example of a game that tries to be something much more ambitious and powerful than its flawed building blocks - even imperfectly - are advised to check this out. The game is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PS3) and USA (PC, X-Box 360, PS3).","Conceptually and narratively bold, but the gameplay suffers a bit.",1362096000,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Lately, I've been going back through the console's library of games and stumbled upon Super Mario 3D World. I had watched videos and read reviews upon it's release in 2013 when it was hailed as the Wii U's first triumph. 3 years later l finally had a chance to discover Super Mario 3D World, and to no one's surprise, it is still an excellent game that makes clever use of the Wii U's gamepad.

Earlier this year Nintendo brought us Nintendo Selects, discounted titles for a great price and this game happens to be one of them. Super Mario 3D World was already on my list of must-haves, but with the price drop it only validated my purchase.

Super Mario 3D World is the true successor to Super Mario 64. In that sense it's not an exceedingly original game, but it adds a few twists, puzzles and new that makes it another highly enjoyable Mario title. Everything from the music to the physics, right down to the way you jump into maps is reminiscent of or taken straight from Super Mario 64.

While it may not be the most original approach it's not necessarily a bad thing, Super Mario 64 is a great came to be compared with. Yet it's no the exact same game, Nintendo clearly wanted to make a modern SM64 with 3D World and create a game that would appeal to new and older gamers alike. I believe they achieved their goal with this game.

The game uses the Wii U's Gamepad for various effects. Tapping on the screen to jump on certain surfaces or blowing in the gamepad mic so as to make a platform move are wonderful examples. To me it only adds to the game's value that the gamepad is used to capacity. It adds a creative touch that elevates the game to the next level.

The environments are rich and complex leaving you with plenty to explore. From a visual standpoint some of the levels are impressive to marvel upon. For instance, one particular stage makes creative use of shadows to navigate characters through. Chances are you'll want to do some of these levels over to collect stars you may have missed or simply to enjoy the scenery once more.

New addition includes clear tubes that suck you in, the cloud tube, the cat suit and the intuitive gamepad play. One of the game's best items was the cherry. Picking a cherry lets you create a clone yourself, picking a second cherry creates another and so on. Playing with 2-3 Marios is more fun than one! Super Mario 3D World is full of surprises.

I like that you can play as other characters than Mario. In what is perhaps a nod to Super Mario Bros. 2, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad are all playable. Each character plays a little differently and has it's own quirks that makes it unique. As an example, Princess Peach can hover for a few seconds due to her dress. It makes playing with each character a different experience. It's also perk that a second can join the action at any given time, making for some fun multiplayer action.

There are different suits that give you powers. The cat suit for instance, allows you to climb walls and claw at enemies. Then there are your classic mushrooms, fireballs, Tanoiki and white Tanoiki suit. Ever wondered what Peach or Toad would look like in a Fireball or Tanoiki suit? The game offers you that wonderful opportunity.

Nintendo's trademark bright colour palette looks fantastic in Super Mario 3D world and the game brings the best out of the Wii U. That makes it one of the best Mario titles in recent years. It may be reminiscent of Super Mario 64, but it stands on it's own so as to not be Super Mario 64. It's a fun, classic-style Mario game that much like it's title implies, sees our main protagonist delve into an open 3D World. It offers a few new additions and unexpected twists that makes it stand solid ground on it's own. The fine folks at Nintendo did us well with Super Mario 3D World and at this price it's definitely worth it. 4.5 stars.",One of the Wii U's definitive titles (4.5*),1461196800,2,,

The very first expansion pack way back when was pretty revolutionary - it seemed like not very many companies were doing such a thing as releasing expansions.  And back then it gave what the users were demanding - new objects.  Today our demands are much higher as consumers, yet Maxis still doesn't *entirely* listen.  It seems like with the Sims 2 their strategy is to release one new aspect of the game that fans have been wanting for ages - while still leaving out a big chunk of things people desire.

In this case Maxis decided to 'answer' to something people have been asking for - the ability to follow their sims to work.  No you can't follow Bella Goth to her job as Mayor of Sim City or whatever, but you can now create businesses - either in the home or by owning a community lot - and manage virtually all aspects of them, from the pricing to the staff to the merchandise.

Virtually anything can be made into a store, or if you want, a recreational facility.  Having other expansions, particularly Nightlife, is helpful in this respect.  In terms of stores my first shop was a lamp store (super random) but you can do anything from clothing to groceries to furniture to art to a bakery.  As a result many of the new objects in the game are designed for displaying these items.

There is also the opportunity to build toys, flower bouquets, or robots if you want to design a store around one, or all of these items, thanks to new tool benches.  Which leads me to one of the features of the game - talent badges.  Your sims can now work at one of seven skills - including toy making, sales, and operating a cash register - to earn bronze, silver, and gold talent badges that will make their businesses that much easier to manage.

As well, as your business flourishes you earn rewards that can do anything from boost your reputation to give you wholesale discounts on items in the store.  Aside from building a basic ""buy and sell"" type store you can also open restaurants, clubs, lounges, gyms...with these you have the option to place a small machine that charges visiting sims by the hour if they want to stay on your lot.

Ultimately, The Sims 2: Open for Business is great if you want to add a new dimension of GAMEPLAY to your Sims' world.  The challenge of mastering a store, never mind a million different types of stores, can be frustrating, but it's also fun and exciting to see what can happen.  I've learnt something new with every business I've owned, and you can own multiple businesses, as well as keep a regular job if you so please.

In terms of CONTENT I wouldn't say buy this pack if that's what you're looking for - there are about 3 or 4 new hairstyles for men and women, and a handful of outfits which are tailored to the ""set uniform"" option for store owners that lets you theme your employees in everything from uniform ninja looks to gorilla heads to chef hats to matching tops and tees.  Furniture-wise it's the same, not too many new things although the floors and walls have been updated with a lot of practical new styles, unlike the crazy ones found in past expansions.

Overall I'd say this is my favourite expansion in terms of gameplay (University is monotonous and dates are too easy to 'master') but it wouldn't be nearly as fun without the content added in the previous expansions.  I think it'd be nice if Maxis offered fans a 'full package' of new services in each expansion - new content & gameplay that's satisfying for a 6 month period at least, but it looks like you'll just have to limit your gameplay so you don't get sick of it for now.",Another piece of the pie...,1159401600,19,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Sparks,"I was pleasantly suprised by Ubisoft's other Prince of Persia offering--the Sands of Time--when I picked it up on clearance several months ago.  The game had an undeniable charm, and, while the level structure needed some work, it was a great game.

The Warrior Within, however, takes a drastically different approach, both graphically and story-wise.  Gone are the magnificent towers and palaces that filled Sands of Time, replaced instead with dank, gritty dungeons and fortresses.  The game is much more dark, reflected in the voice acting, the music, and the overall story.  I, for one, don't mind this change as much, but I know that it's a sticking point with some other gamers.

Graphics--I was actually slightly disappointed by the character models when I first started the game--they seemed a little bit too stiff for my liking.  Perhaps it's because the FMV sequences are truely excellent.  However, I became used to the graphical style quickly.  4/5 stars.

Gameplay--the game really shines here, as it's possible to pull off insane combos.  I was worried that I would be relegated to simply mashing buttons, but I picked up on the ""free-form fighting"" system relatively quickly, and before I knew it, I was swinging around posts, bounding over enemies, propelling myself off of walls, and chopping off heads with the best of them.  5/5.

Sound--this is where Warrior Within suffers.  The soundtrack is bearable in most locations, although industrial music is a very weird partnering for a game set in ancient Persia.  I happen to like industrial music, but I can see how this would irritate some.  Voice acting is OK, but the Prince has a new voice actor this time around.  Some of the lines--particularly where the Prince curses--seem forced.  3/5.

Story--the story is interesting, although Ubisoft seems to have gone off the deep end.  Sands of Time offered a very satisfying story that wrapped up neatly.  But with Warrior Within . . . BOOM, just like that the Prince is running for his life.  The story isn't bad, it's just that it doesn't jive with the previous game like I think it should.  4/5.

The story of Okami focuses on the journey of Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, as she attempts to restore the beauty of life to a devastated world, Nippon. The evil of the eight headed serpent Orochi has been unleashed after having been sealed away for 100 years, and Amaterasu must defeat the vile beast in order to save humanity. But is Orochi truly the cause of all the evil in the world? You are going to have to play to find out.

Okami's art style is unique as it is meant to look like a Japanese painting. So colors are bright and vivid and the look of the land is highly stylized. Characters talk in little more than a silly sounding gibberish, but you'll find yourself fast forwarding through extra long speeches as the gibberish can get a little annoying after a long time. The story is surprisingly long and involved, as there is evil to eradicate from all of Nippon.

Gameplay first appears to be your standard adventure fare, with lots of exploring of wide open areas and combat against hordes of enemies. But what makes Okami unique is a tool called the Celestial Brush. Using it, you can literally overlay the screen with a piece of parchment and draw symbols using a calligraphy brush. Drawing symbols will do incredible things, such as make flowers and massive trees bloom amidst a cloud of flying Sakura petals, create giant firework bombs that will blow open cracked walls, or even summon the elements of nature to your aid in battle. As Amaterasu defeats enemies and restores the land, she will gain Praise which can be used to increase her health, ink and other abilities. By the end of the game if you've earned enough praise, Amaterasu definitely becomes mighty on the level of a god in flesh form. If you really want a challenge when playing this game, try to collect all 100 stray beads. You'll be at it for a long time.

First, the level design has gotten simpler in an effort to streamline the original.  However, in an effort to do so, the layouts of the buildings have gotten quite absurd. For example, they now have stationed an office (with the 2 programmers in Kalinatek) behind a wall, aside a narrow corridor. In the last part, with the Palace, they have stationed cameras on bushes!  The XBox version had a more realistic design.  Next, the addition of the new suit and mission is nice, but overall, the additional mission wasn't too exceptional.  Additionally, the loading times for the PS2 version were too long, and the checkpoints were not save points at all on the PS2 version, like the XBox version.  Lastly, the boss fights (especially Grinko's) were stupid and quite annoying.  They streamlined the boss fight too much, and it lacked the realism (and extreme difficulty) of the original.
Now to the props...
The addition of binoculars were great.  They were definitely helpful, especially given the fact that I used the SC-20K's scope as binoculars in the XBox version.  Next, the cinematic movies made more sense and added much more to the story, although the XBox version of the opening cinematic was much better, with the inclusion of the Chemical Brothers' technobeats.  The PS2 version made Sam seem much older with the orchestral music, a disappointment on my behalf.  Lastly, some of the modifications they made in enemy and their placements was greatly appreciated, and it did intensify the situation a wee bit more.

4.0,False,"04 19, 2004",A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B0000296Z1,Ethan D Van Vorst,"Sometimes I feel the urge to play an older game. I don't know, it's just that today some of the titles require such high-end stats and make you wade through more menus that I yearn for the days of old when games were just much more straightforward. In addition there's just not that many single-player games in production these days and I remember a time when it was the single-player mode that a game was rated by, multi-player being more of a novelty.
Mechwarrior II:Mercenaries is a reasonable translation of tabletop BattleTech to computer gaming. I say ""reasonable"" because there are finer nuances that have been altered to make the computer gaming experience more palatable. More on that in a second, let's give this game it's due. Building on the slightly older Mechwarrior II and expansion pack this game gave you the viewpoint of the Inner Sphere (IS) domains. Coincidentally most BattleTech players I've ever dealt with play IS in one form or another, and so the first Mechwarrior II, while pretty, seemed a little odd. No Mechwarror game since this one has covered the Clan Invasion of 3051 and it's a crying shame, more classic combat scenarios came out of that era than any other, hands down.
You start out as a mercenary commander (your CO blown away in the awesome, totally BattleTech inspired intro). Over the years you acquire better Mechs and weapon systems, salvage partially destroyed equipment (and even more Mechs), and spend your money wisely upgrading. You can also hire up to 2 Lance mates, although as a BattleTech purist I really would have liked to have had 3, a Lance being 4 Mechs in number. You can also hire a single Aerospace fighter or bomber pilot, flying the classic 3025 models (Stukas, Lucifers, Corsairs, and more). As the game progresses your stature and fame in the IS grows, until strange stories come from the Periphery of a marauding army of souped up Mechs destroying all in thier path. In one of the most memorable game sequences I ever played (ever, to this day) you escape with some Periphery pirates (common enemies make strange bedfellows, eh?) and flee in a stolen Pegasus Light Hovercraft to a perfectly taut soundtrack.
The cutscenes were wonderful and the game exudes pure BattleTech. The new Mercenaries captures a lot of the dynamics of running an independent mercenary company in the BT universe but just doesn't take it from this era, which is a shame.
This game, good as it is, still has some flaws. If you flip through your 3025 manuals you'll see most of the Mechs are here, save for a few notable ones like the Rifleman, Warhammer, Phoenix Hawk, and my favorite, the Hatchetman. My understanding is there is an ongoing licensing problem with some of these designs, basically carbon copied from the RoboTech universe. Weapons don't seem to do as much damage, but I understand that's a necessary evil of the design. On a tabletop the average life expectancy of some units isn't even a full minute, and so while you may expect to obliterate that unwary Commando with your AC20 in one shot it's a little dissappointing to see it take up to 3. Your Lance members oftentimes don't know where they're going, although admittedly they can hit thier targets. The vaunted Aerospace Pilot works for only a few missions and then simply ceases to work, simply hovering in place over the battlefield, regardless of how many times you tell him to attack. And I won't lie, there are a number of impossible missions that will have you scouring the web looking for invulnerability cheats, the first and foremost on my mind being the set of missions on the ice freighter.

The main reasons I didn't want to buy one was because everytime Nintendo releases a handheld, they release another in 6 months - to a year and your old handheld is useless as is out of date. A huge rip off if you bought it full price just before the next instalment was released.

This is Nintendo's first 3D console, the reason why I love it compared to the rest which are all for Platform games (like the Gameboy, etc.)

The graphic engine is nowhere near as good as the PSP's but the Nintendo DS is roughly the same graphics ability as the old Nintendo 64.

I got my DS along witht he Mario Kart Bundle, and I was upset to find I could only have a Silver. I really wanted a Blue but there was nothing I could do.

One of the positive points about the Nintendo DS is the Mario Series. Its why I love Nintendo so much and it's a shame they probably won't release Banjo-Kazooie or other classics like that on the handheld because of damn xbox.

Other things I love is the touch screen but you really do need to get a protective screen to keep it clean and dirt free, otherwise it makes your Nintendo DS look horrid.

Unlike the PSP, the Nintendo DS allows you to go into chat rooms and write messages with your stylus (the NDS pen) or type them in English, Japanese or a select few other languages. It helps if your friends have DS's and not PSP ;P

Overall I think the DS is a fun little handheld, and knowing my luck another will be released in a few months and it'll be the same old thing with Nintendo.

I haven't tried Wipeout Fusion from PS2 yet but the reviews seemed to indicate that there has been little new so I decided to try this game instead- especially now that it has hit the bargain bins in most stores.
XG3 is very very similar to Wipeout.
Pros:
Good graphics compared to PS1 Wipeout. (no surprise here.)
Frame rates are very high so driving thru the more advanced tracks is quite exhilirating, once you've bought a new engine.
The tracks are quite nice but I don't think you get much of a chance to enjoy the art work otherwise you'll find yourself grinding against the side of the track.
You get to keep the weapons that you buy rather than use it for  a short period of time.
Controls are responsive. Should probably reconfig the turbo and
gas controls right away to use the shoulder buttons.
Weapons are very very similar to wipeout. Machine gun, heat seeking missiles, rockets, shield enhancers, mines, ...
Cons:
You have to earn $ to be able to get different weapons. Wipeout lets you use them as you find them.
Not sure how choosing different bikers makes any difference. The manual does not say much and there is no obvious sense of it in the game.
It took me quite a bit of effort to win race 2. The hint comes at the back of the manual where it says you have to ""feather"" the turbo. What does that mean??? Some biker-techno-term? Turns out it means repeatedly pumping it and releasing it to get more out of your turbo. That was the only way I could catch up with the computer controlled drivers.
Music in Wipeout is much much better.
It's difficult to tell whether your weapons really helped. E.g. deploy the mines and expect to hear some kind of explosion like in Wipeout. Not in XG3. I think there is a sound but I'm not sure if it's an impact explosion.

I know a lot of people had gripes about the story, but I enjoyed it. They pretty much scrapped the story line for this one (outside of the Animus), but it is still somewhat there. I just wish they had continued it in some way. The way the story is now though, will allow more entries into the series, so Ubisoft was smart about it. As for not having fullscreen borderless mode, it can be a pain for some people. I like to play in fullscreen borderless because I have multiple monitors. I would play this game with the triple monitors, but this game definitely doesn't benefit from it like an FPS or MMO.

Great voice acting and very detailed gundams!  Stages play well with good story lines.  Every characters signature attacks are here and are easy to pull off.  Some may complain that this is just another dynasty warriors game.  Alas, on the outside it may be just that.

4.0,False,"07 29, 2009",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B0017XFP8G,Raul G.,"I've been a fan of flight-sims and flight-action games ever since playing Flight Simulator '95 on my parents old PC. I also grew up playing Ace Combat on the Playstation and have followed that series avidly for a number of years. So when Ubisoft announced Tom Clancy's HAWX I was immediately interested in the title. I've now managed to complete the game and have logged quite a few hours online as well.

So I'll begin with what's to like about the game. First, the selection of aircraft in the game is second-to-none! HAWX features everything from standard F-15, F-16, F-14, F-22, Su-25, Su-27, MiG-29, etc, aircraft that are readily found in most flight games to more exotic planes like the YF-12/SR-71, F-35 Lightning II, X-29, F-15 ACTIVE, F-18 HARV and a number of other fantastic aircraft. If you're a fan of fighters/multi-role jet aircraft this game will amaze you!

Unlike Ace Combat, HAWX also features real-world locations like Rio de Janeiro, Chicago, Tokyo and Los Angeles and a number of other locations. HAWX incorporates real satellite imagery from GeoEye into the game and famous landmarks will be instantly recognizable.

The game features 3 difficulty levels which directly impact the players load-out in each plane as well as damage characteristics. On 'normal' you'll find your plane capable of sustaining major damage and multiple missile strikes while carrying literally hundreds of missiles and bombs. It's not realistic though it's not meant to be. On 'elite' difficulty the game ramps the difficulty by cutting the amount of weapons you can carry (although still unrealistically high) and making damage realistic - one missile will down your plane.

HAWX also features an in-depth leveling system. Successfully destroying air and ground targets will net the player 'XP' which is tallied at the end of each level. The levels mirror real-life Air Force ranks (though some extra levels are thrown in) from a basic Airman all the way to General of the Air Force. All told there are 40 levels which equate to about 1.4 million 'XP'. Figuring that most missions will net a few thousand 'XP' the replay value is relatively high due to the requirements for reaching the highest ranks/levels. Also, upon leveling up the game rewards the players with new planes, paint schemes and weapons loads.

There are a few areas where I feel HAWX could be better. For one thing the game features 2 modes for flying your plane - ""Assistance ON"" & ""Assistance OFF"". Assistance OFF essentially makes your aircraft incredibly maneuverable - so much so that you'll be able to perform impossible turns and Mach 2+ easily weaving and dodging missiles. The unfortunate part of ""OFF"" mode is that the game locks your camera into a distant and awkward viewpoint. Your aircraft will be the size of a dime and targeting accurately is nightmarish due to the awkward controls. Due to the camera you'll be forced to blind fire missiles at enemies that you can't readily see - only trusting that you have a lock-on because of the audio chimes. Ultimately I found ""OFF"" mode more of a hassle than it was worth and stuck to a more traditional cockpit camera that is both functional (display information) and intuitive in relation to the control scheme. Using ""ON"" mode limits your aircraft to more familiar laws of physics though you'll at least be able to choose which camera suits your flying style best.

Also, though the graphics are good I feel that they're somewhat lacking in key areas. We all know that the PS3 is capable of some truly amazing visuals and because HAWX is a multi-platform game it just doesn't shine. The aircraft are rendered well but small touches like air-brakes are missing. When using aircraft like the F-15 active with canards you'd expect to be able to see the canards move from the cockpit camera but they're mysteriously absent. The replay mode is decent but limited in it's camera options and is strangely mute of engine sounds.

All in all I think that fans of flight-action games and Ace Combat will probably find HAWX enjoyable. Hopefully Ubisoft sees fit to continue the series and improve upon this good first undertaking!",Just Short of Greatness,1248825600,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},
4.0,True,"03 28, 2010",AX6VFPCMDEQFR,B002BH3N2W,Andrew M. Todd,"If you are looking for a serious racing game, obviously this is not for you.
However, if you enjoyed Mario Kart Wii this might be of interest. The two games are alike in many ways, but they play quite differently. For example, if you were frustrated by the over abundance of weapons in Mario Kart, that is not the case here. While the weapons are simliar in usuage, they are much more rare and not nearly as devestating. Winning a race is much more about knowing track layouts and skillfull drifting than pelting other racers with items. Especially with online matches, this is a definite plus.
  Yes, this game supports online matches, and despite a few missteps or oversights by SEGA they tend to be quite good, although finding a match might take awhile. To be fair, I purchased this game day one, so perhaps there simply weren't many players availible yet. BTW, friend codes are required to race specific people. Of course local multiplayer is always an option.
 Track variety is pretty good, featuring levels from Sonic, Jet Set Radio, House of the Dead, Samba de Amigo, Monkey Ball and Billy Hatcher, but given SEGA'S rich history, it feels kind of skimpy, especially considering the lack of Outrun or Virtua racer courses. Character variety is in the same boat, and while it is great to see Alex Kidd and Ulala, why no Gilius Thunderhead? Where is Toejam and Earl? How did Big the cat make the cut and not the cast of Streets of Rage?

 There is a good amount of content here: Grand Prix, challenges, time trials, and a store where you can unlock racers, courses and music. This game is definetly worth a look, and I feel confident recommending it to any Sega/kart racing fan.

They will never compare to the triple-A stuff, but if you're just looking for a simple shooting fix, this particular package offers a pretty decent deal. Two WWII games in their Battlestrike series for one reasonable price. Each of these games runs 8 missions, so each game is pretty short, but taken together at 16 fairly long missions, it's comparable to a single full-length game. Each of these games uses the Jupiter-EX engine, so the graphics are actually pretty good, with a ton of adjustable options configurable from the main menu (though the menus and sub-menus took me a few seconds to figure out). The keyboard defaults to standard PC FPS controls, and the only key I needed to change was the 'crouch' key. All keys except the F5 (quicksave) and F9 (quickload) are re-assignable. I'm using Vista 64-bit, a Q6600 and a 9800GT at 1920 x 1200, and getting fairly playable rates with everything maxed. But for smoothest gameplay and best looks balance, I set both games to 1600 x 1080, where they seem to run the smoothest for me at max settings.

The game plays well enough, but it's nothing special. It is fun though, if you just need a good action-packed shooter fix. Had this been a full-priced game, I'd have knocked off another star, but with two short games included for a reasonable price, I think it's a good value as long as you keep your expectations realistic. City Interactive also has other games out there, and I've played most of them, and the quality is similar in all of them, with a few standing out as better: ""Sniper: Art of Victory"" is probably my favorite, since I like slower-paced and more thoughtful shooters (but don't get that one confused with ""WWII Sniper: Call To Victory"", which is also decent, but a much older game by a different studio).",Good value package.,1241222400,4,,

Inside the box are the headphones themselves which come protected in a cardboard molded packaging, a small packet containing instructions and two chords, one to connect to the Xbox One controller and a standard 3.5mm jack for connecting to other audio devices like iPad, stereo etc.

The headphones themselves, once out the packaging, look very plasticy however the build quality on them appears to be very good.

The adjustable headband has plenty of padding and are comfortable to wear.  The ear pieces also have plenty of padding making them comfortable on the ears.  These are not however noise cancelling earphones and when you have them on you can still hear ambient noise quite easily.

Tucked inside the left hand ear piece you have a retractable microphone.  This is a neat touch since you can simply slide it back inside its housing when you don't need it.  The microphone is also adjustable so you can easily just bend it into place without harming it.  The microphone, unlike the ear pieces, is noise cancelling and works very well in games to reduce ambient noise.

The ear pieces themselves light up a pale blue.  In daylight the light isn't that strong but in a darkened room they are actually fairly bright.  Unfortunately this can have an accidental side effect in that if the room is dark, you can actually get a reflection off the ear pieces in your television/Monitor.  Luckily there is a little switch on the Xbox connector so that you can turn off the lights in the ear pieces should you want to.  I can see this being an attraction to the younger gamer.

The sound quality from the headphones is quite good. It's not the best I've heard but it does have nice bass and the treble isn't tinny. The headphones give a nice round sound although whilst playing on the Xbox it tends to lean a lot towards the bass.  Whilst testing these out listening to songs on my iPad, although the headphones are bass heavy, you can easily adjust the tonal range by selecting a different preset equalizer.

The headphones however have fairly major disadvantage to them, they are heavy.  Although very comfortable to wear, after roughly an hours gaming with them I found that I was starting to get a sore neck, which inevitably led to getting a headache.  So, for me at least, I couldn't wear these for a long time.

One other thing I would like to see, and some manufacturers like Turtle Beach do this, is bass and treble controls on the Xbox connector so that you can adjust the sound balance to suit as these are fairly bass heavy.

4.0,True,"11 17, 2003",A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B00005EBF8,Logical Paradox,"Operation flashpoint is a Tactical first person shooter set in a 1980's ""cold war turns hot"" scenario. For those of you not in the know, while most First person shooters focus on rambo-style action, tactical shooters emphazise realism, planning, and ussually allow you to control a team.
The plot isn't exactly a novelty, A soviet invasion of a small group of Islands results in a serious clash between US and Russian forces. The story is enough to drive the gameplay however and make you feel you are fighitng for a purpose.
The game differentiates itself from others in the genre in many ways. To begin with, this is the first FPS I've seen that attempts to completely simulate combined arms combat, with a commitment to militarily accuracy. A complete compliment of 1980's military hardware is featured in the game, from abrahams tanks, to AH64 Apache Longbows, to T-80 Tanks, to a number of accuratley reproduced firearms. The selection is amazing. A large selection of machine guns, sub machine guns, grenades, tanks, planes, helocopters, APCs, and even boats are available. Each has SPECIFIC and very different features and specs. You can actually notice accuracy differences between rifles. And you can use ALL of them!
That's a BIG selling point for this game. Before Battlefield 1942 and other games like it, Operation Flashpoint was perhaps the first game to feature combined arms. So not only is it a first person shooter, but it's a tank simulator, a flight sim, and a driving game! And you can use ANY vehicle in the game. You see a car in a small town - get in a drive. You see a dead enemy soldier with a weapon, drop what you got and pick up his instead. You can even get in boats. This kind of freedom is definatley unusual.
The landscape and mission paradigm is also free form. You can go ANYWHERE. You are never limited as to where you can go in a mission, and you can get in a car and drive miles in the wrong direction if you so choose. You can complete any mission in whatever way you like too - sneak into a town and complete your mission, or jump into an empty enemy tank and blow everyone away.
Realism is a key emphasis. Get shot a few times, or once in the head, and you're dead. Get your legs shot up and you can't run as fast, or may have to crawl around. Shoot out a tire on a truck and it goes flat. Shoot an engine you might disable it completely. You have a compass and map, and a watch to tell time and there is a realist time cycle - it will change from day to dusk to night at appropriate times - and there is also weather variations. Run too long and you get tired. I've rarely seen such dedication to realism in a game.
This realism extends to graphics and sounds. All vehicles are accuratley rendered both inside and out. You can choose first person or 3rd person view, so you can actually sit inside a tank and look around at the inside. Detail is present in graphics - there is even a working speedometer on car dashboards! The use of sprites and less than perfect textures on some objects like houses and fauna limits the eye candy to some degree but otherwise the game looks really good, especially for being a 2001 release. Sound is great, and very realistic. Hearing bullets whiz by you or the reverb of a tank shot is enough to convince you that you're actually in danger!
The problems with the game are bugs. Motion is can be stuttery at times, and occasionally you'll get stuck, or pass through solid matter - if only the army got ahold of that technology! The controls for the various vehicles can have some issues, as flying is a real pain. Driving too, isn't perfect - OFP is a jack of all trades and a master of none. The realism also makes for a VERY difficult gaming experience at times. The WORST mistake was the choice to limit you to only ONE save per mission. A HUGE pain. You will no doubt have to play the same parts of a hard mission over and over and over thanks to this, and while it adds to realism, players should always be given the option to save more if they choose. This really can hurt the gameplay experience. I often become frustrated with this, especially since all it takes is one tiny wrong move to get yourself a in body bag.
Bottom line: This was a ground breaking game. If you love detailed realistic games and are a military enthusiast, you will have an orgasm playing this game! Just be prepared for a first person war simulation - NOT at all an arcade game. If you just like quick action then you best look somewhere else. This is a great game that needs some polishing, hopefully the sequel will address the flaws.

4.0,False,"06 6, 2006",AKMJJES6FE2M5,B0002VKQFG,Andrew C.,"I've never been big on first-person shooter (FPS) games, although I've played a few, like Star Wars: Battlefront 2, that I've found entertaining. So, getting this game was taking a chance, since I'm partial to real-time strategy games and roleplaying games.  Overall, I must say that I've really had a good time with UT 2004. It hasn't made me more of a fan of the FPS genre, but I am definitely looking forward to UT 2007.

Gameplay: The controls are the typical mouse, WASD keys, and hotkeys associated with FPS games, so anyone familiar with the FPS genre ought to be able to jump right in. You have a number of options for your in-game character, including race, gender, name, etc. You can also choose your AI teammates and the number on each team.  Additionally, there are ten game modes, including deathmatch, capture the flag (CTF), domination (requires you to hold two points), assault (objective based), bombing run (a deadly version of soccer), and onslaught (securing nodes and destroying the enemy base). There's fun to be had with each mode, but I suspect that most people will find the greatest replayabiity in the onsault, assault, CTF, and team deathmatch modes. The maps are large enough for some strategic thinking (especially on assault and onslaught), and the game comes with about 100 maps--with many more that can be downloaded from the internet.

AI opponents (""bots"") are very good in this game. They have strong attack scripts, good pathfinding, will follow orders, and generally work well as teams. I detected some of the typical AI cheating found in FPS games (i.e., extra health, amazing accuracy, accelerated movement) toward the end of the tournament and in some of the tougher matches, but generally the AI here is just plain challenging and well programmed. Although many will buy this game for the multiplayer side, the single-player content (which is all that I play) is quite strong. The game does not have a compelling story to tell, but the tournament mode lasted me 25-30 hours on ""experienced"" difficulty level. I don't feel a need to replay the tournament anytime soon, but there are a lot of individual maps and modes that are greatly replayable.

A few things that add a lot to the game are the variety of weapons available and the vehicles. Overall, none of the weapons are very overpowered, though some are better and more versatile than others. Some weapons are best suited for one situation, while others can be useful in some fashion under a number of conditions. A second element that adds variety to the game is the vehicles. I can't overemphasize how fun these can be. Not only do they break up the monotony of having to sprint on foot across the map, but they also add a new strategic and tactical layer to a game. Vehicles can be game winners, but they are not invincible. Some can carry multiple passengers, who can man various weapons or simply go along for the ride. However, to maintain balance, characters on foot have a few very strong anti-vehicle weapons, and many objectives cannot be completed by vehicles. Still, there's nothing like decapitating a fleeing opponent with the blades of a Scorpion buggy or hearing the thundering cannon of a Goliath tank.

The gameplay is frantic, exciting, and straightforward enough to appeal to a range of gamers. You never feel lost on the maps, since there is a good in-game mini-map and the objectives are always clear. Also, you never get the sense that you are babysitting your computer allies, since they act as intelligently--more so on many occasions--as the average human player. The game's flaws are mostly minor, but worth mentioning. First, there are a few rather frustrating missions in the tournament that the average player will have to repeat several times (at least on experienced difficulty and higher). And there is no way to adjust the difficulty level of the tournament once it starts. Also, the game-save system is automatic; the game saves after every match, win or loss. Thus, you can find yourself broke if you lose enough matches, and you'll have to play a series of qualifying matches to earn enough money to continue the tournament. It's a system that gets old quick and really adds a layer of repetition to the game that serves little purpose. Finally, some people will be put off by the amount of acrobatics that the game includes. On some of the more advanced levels and difficulty settings, AI opponents are hopping, flipping, and cartwheeling in ways that make them nearly impossible to hit, though they will seem to hit you just fine. I think that the game plays just a tad bit too fast and requires too much jumping around. But you'll get used to it.

Graphics: Great-looking game. The maps are very impressive in detail and size. Be sure to take a lot of screenshots! The models are all rendered well, from the characters to the vehicles. Weapon fire and particle effects look good, as does the natural environment, especially skies. Have no doubt about it, this is a very violent game. Dying animations are graphic, and people tend to end up in pieces or as skeletal remains. Overall, the art direction is rock solid.

Sound: Although decent, the audio is not as good as the visuals. Weapons such as miniguns and tank cannon sound like they should, along with footsteps, flowing water, and other ambiant effects. In-game AI characters tend to use the same list of taunts such as ""Ownage!"" or ""You suck!"" or ""You be dead!""--along with a few choice obscenities--but none of the characters really stand out with individual personalities. The music is the typical techno fare found in many video games, nothing special.

Documentation/Stability: The manual that comes with the game is informative and makes up for a rather bland in-game tutorial. The game was pretty stable on my computer, though I experienced one freeze and one crash during the tournament. Overall, the game seemed well polished and optimized.

Replayability: Given the number of maps that come with the game, the developer's Bonus Pack that can be downloaded for free from the internet, the large number of player-made maps available, and the editor tools that you can use to make your own maps, this game has had a long shelf life. If you get tired of playing against the AI, you can go online and play against a human opponent. For me, about half of the 10 gameplay modes are not appealing after a few rounds, but the other 5 (especially assault, onslaught, and CTF) are always good fun.

If you are a fan of FPS games, UT 2004 seems to be a must-buy (I'd be surprised if you don't already have it!). From what I have read, it is the best of the Unreal series and still has an active online community. For those of us who only have a passing interest in FPS games, this is a good one to blow some time with.

Your character is a newly-hired ghostbuster recruit that gets to test some new equipment when things start to go very wrong. You get to visit the Sedgewick hotel (and re-capture slimer in the same ballroom as the first movie), and many other nostalgic tie-ins to the movies.

The campaign gameplay is particularly fun. Wrangling ghosts with the proton pack and throwing out traps to catch them was right on. The only problem I had with my game was in the library where the game stuttered. But the voice acting, music (pretty much straight from the movie soundtracks sounds like), and sounds are right on. The sounds in particular. The sound of the proton pack being engaged or hearing it tear through furniture, etc.

The online gameplay is a nice addition to the game. You can pick from the 4 ghostbusters and the rookie and earn money to advance your rank. I found it also particularly interesting that certain ghosts are on the ""Most Wanted"" list and you encounter them almost randomly when playing. The missions are challenging and include: Thief (protect 4 artifacts from thieving ghosts), Protection (power up a PKE disrupter and protect it while it starts up from attack), Containment (catch all ghosts w/in timelimit), Slime Dunk (compete to slam slimers into traps), Survival (survive wave after wave of ghosts/demons).

As such, it is really not much more than an add on to the old game.  Graphics and gameplay have changed very little and storyline is mostly the same.  Really the only thing that makes this game a must buy for all RPG loving Gamecube owners is the fact that Skies of Arcadia is great.  Peroid.
Following the basic guidelines set by the beloved Final Fantasy series, Skies of Arcadia starts with Vyse, a young Blue Rouge sky pirate.  Over the course of his adventures he will meet new people, gain new powers, and kill entire populations of random beasts.  What makes Skies so much more than a FF rip off is the setting, a world of floating continents and powerful flying warships.  Few games place the importance of exploring like Skies.  You will literally need to fly into every corner of the map if yu expect to win the game.
Combat is a slight twist on the standard fare.  Both ship and personal combat revolves around the idea of placing in commands then letting the move play itself out.  Fastest charaters go first and slowest last.  Its fun and useful and if you want to go get a drink, the action can continue without you. Ship battles are only slightly different but even more fun to watch.
The story in and of itself is a great one and will keep you well interested throughout.  Although Vyse is placed on a very set path, at any time a player can leave it and go off in search of battles and ""discoveries"" which can be found by searching the skys.  The new Wanted Battles also allow a bit more variety in movement and a new set of powerful foe.  Although the ending is not nearly so twisted as FFVII, it is plenty interesting.
The only real problem with Skies is the high level of random encounters and their monotony.  Though lower than the Dreamcast title, you still only have about 15-20 seconds to fly around before you are attacked by another dozen enemies.  If you are trying to find discoveries or treasure chests, this can quickly become annoying.  Fortunetly the new ""moonfish"" quest will give you a way out of this fairly early, if you should want.
Overall, this is the best RPG for the Gamecube to date.  This is not suprising because Skies was the best RPG on the Dreamcast to date(minus Grandia II).  If you like RPG's or even like a bit of flying around and exploring, I highly recommend this game for purchase.  Like it, Live it, Love it.",A Very Good Game...,1046044800,60,,

4.0,False,"09 6, 2016",A1BB4H9G9APMT3,B017MRX6CM,Da Jester,"Unless you received an awesome discount as a Prime Member, it's still pointless to buy any World of Warcraft (WoW) expansions physically. Much like the previous expansion, Warlords of Draenor (WoD), the standard price for this at release is still a bit much. Part of the game license key enables you to receive a ""free character boost to 100"" which helps new comers and veterans who want to play the new content as soon as possible. Still in hindsight, $39.99 is a better price in my opinion, especially how this expansion will eventually become part of the complete WoW game package a year later. If they included free game time, that would have sweetened the deal...but this is Blizzard we're talking about. Regardless, even if you just have the starter/free trial from the Battle.net app, you technically have everything downloaded including the 100-110 content and other new expansion only features.

Now that's out of the way, is Legion, the sixth expansion for the only good monthly subscription based MMO worth buying? Honestly, it depends on the player. I know some 10 year veterans of this mmo who either burnt out interest years ago, don't have time or money, or only come back for each expansion then leave a couple of months later. Then you also have long time fans/subscribers of the game franchise, and even complete newcomers to the game franchise as a whole. As of release, Legion is literally a double edge sword in describing it. It's both a good reason to come back to World of Warcraft and to completely begin it. Like all previous expansions for most Blizzard games, Legion provides numerous gameplay improvements and serious standardization changes to meet both existing and new players expectations. A skeptical player of WoW can see both the positives and negatives of some of these class changes easily. For example, gear in Legion is fully standardized utilizing primary stat specializations. If you switch certain class specialization from a healing one to damage dealing or tanking one, the gear itself will switch it's primary stats to suit. Also, many new UI changes and additions have taken place like the collectibles windows and even default combat frames.

Onto the big one: In lieu of the loathed Garrison feature from the previous expansion, Blizzard decided to improve the social aspect of player housing with a much needed oomph . The term Class identity has been a loose subject plaguing WoW for years. For example, what exactly makes me choosing a Rogue so special from the others, like the Druid or Monk classes? That answer really hasn't been answered adequately since probably the Burning Crusade expansion (1st one). Class Order Halls and class artifact weapons are now that answer. Very reminiscent of the Death Knight only area, Archerus, classes now have their own private social hub to further their involvement in Legion. Much like in WoD, players receive various class only quests and manage followers and resources within them. Each one is unique and located in various areas either around old and new areas in Azeroth. At the same time, a very confrontational change (at least to me) to weapon loot is presented within these. In Legion, you do not receive, craft, or loot weapon items. Depending on your class specialization, you instead wield artifacts; weapons that have a prominent history new and old to Warcraft lore. Garonas Daggers for Assassination Rogues, the Doomhammer for Enhancement Shamans, or the Ashbringer for Retribution Paladins to name a few. Each artifact involve a unique quest chain requiring your character to travel to various locations and performing certain quest objectives. Each of these have fully voiced dialogue to push the narrative forward. All of this is presented right at the beginning of the 100-110 grind and its an extremely well done first impression. Artifacts have their own talent trees enabling players to choose or customize abilities to suit certain playstyles while at the same time have their appearance customizable be it unlock by doing something or being transmog-able.

I was bummed about this standardization change when the expansion was announced last year...at first. A big part of playing WoW is earning loot by different means be it boss kills or by completing quests difficult or easy. Its been part of the core experience of playing WoW for years that I felt this was one of the dumbest things Blizzard thought of. HOWEVER, how Legion presents this system to players is actually fun, engaging, and quite the interesting change. Yes, I may have the same Dreadsabers as many other Outlaw Rogues, but how I customize its abilities and appearance is up to ME. And, when you think about it, WoW has become very casual like for years anyway and players eventually gravitated towards certain items, like weapons 85% of the time. Eventually, my rogue would have been stuck with daggers anyway and I usually had to compete against other rogues or classes that can use them too. The only argument against this is Im stuck with these three artifact weapons for literally the rest of the expansion. I hope Blizzard understands that and continues to provide to earn different customizations for these things. Players will indeed level up thier weapons by earning Artifact power from various quests during the level grind and at the level cap.

Next up, Demon Hunters. This has been a class that people have wanted since 2005 after WoW released. Like Arthas, Illidan (on the game box art) is a franchise fan favorite and many players wondered what it would be playing as a Demon Hunter. With Legion, you can finally be that dual warglaive wielding demonic damage dealer youve always wanted to be. I personally have not tried one out since I have numerous 90-100 characters that Im still working on. But so far, Ive heard and seen nothing but fun details about these guys, especially their starting zone. They are the most agile (literally agility is their primary stat) class to date with literally a double jump, glide, and other various mobile based abilities. Apparently, they are not too difficult to learn as my wife is finally playing a melee based character for the first time in10 years. A definite fun and different experience for WoW. The only drawback? Only Night Elves (Alliance) and Blood Elves (Horde) can be them and boy there are tons of elves now (ick). :p

Another big change to Legion is how YOU want to level up in the Broken Isles. Much like Guild Wars 2, content for levels 100-110 now scale with the player. This means you can do which ever new zone at any time and it will be adjusted to you; mob difficulty and quest rewards gear included. Even though each zone contains a primary story quest chain the player will have to follow if they want to finish, its still refreshing to know I can start wherever and end wherever I want. The only zone not doable until 110 is Suramar, the long forgotten Night Elf city. Honestly, this was the smartest decision Blizzard did for the questing end game content.  While all of the zones have some really epic moments and interesting plot lines lore fans will enjoy, this so far is the most interesting out of the new 5. Each zone does provide a unique first impression, but it's apparent why Suramar was saved for last. Don't let that detract you from finishing all quest areas though. Each new zone have their own mains story that pay off like you were playing something like Dragon Age Inquisition or some other single player RPGs. Also, group quests are back in WoW! At the end of the level cap, a new method of doing  ""dailes"" is implemented called World Quests that for some, do require help from other players to finish. Even a pre raid teir set you can obtain which some of it require the usual faction grind many players are familiar with. Now include Class only quests, profession quests and those World Quests, so far Legion is generating a very welcome first impression over WoD and almost any of the previous expansions. Legion actually made me enjoy playing a rogue once again and I can't wait to level up my other level 100s.

Player Vs Player (PVP) content is once again overhauled. This is the official third version of WoWs honor system and its taken a serious present day Call of Duty route. At 110, you then can level, or rank up in PVP now! You even have your own PVP only talent tree which have requirements to unlock many various abilities either passive or usable. These can include reach level 13, win said number of battlegrounds, or obtain a certain rating. When I mention Call of Duty (well, how about Overwatch), I literally mean ityou can prestige in WoW now. Meaning, you can reach the PVP honor cap (50?) then start over again with a prestige rank, and level up 1-50 again but retain the unlocked PVP talents youve earned. This could honestly give players plenty to achieve in PVP situations or could become very one-sided for new players months laterlike Call of Duty. Who knows?

There are tons of new and noticible details to mention with Legion, but this review is already long enough. For example, theyve added new animations so combat looks less dull now. With my previous review of WoD, I gave it a 4/5 and praised it for the first month it was out, including the seriously loathed Garrison feature. Like WoD, Legion has started off amazing and even the most skeptical viewings I had with the new features, I admit that Im finding enjoyment within them. Im already having problems deciding what to level up like before. Right now, At the moment, Artifact weapons and the class halls are having a strong first impression with me. That impression might be completely different for somebody else new or old with a different class. To predict that those features could become the hated among WoW players in a couple of months is impossible to tell at the moment. WoD made me take a very long break before its first major update. for it I literally only re-subscribed to WoW on August 30th, 2016. So, like I said, it depends on the type of player if Legion is worth coming back to World of Warcraft. I believe that for new and old players, it will be great. For others, it may not. For certain though, its too overpriced if they are requiring you to still pay a monthly subscription though. But hey!

1) Amazing photo realistic graphics. There are very few games which can even compete with Modern Warfare 1 or 2 but this one literally blows both of these games away. Awesome explosions, Helghan death animations are awesome. Great facial features(they are all ugly but remember this is not a beauty contest.)

2) The first person cover system is very well implemented!! Why can't they do this in the Call of Duty games. It is a sticky cover system and it is so fun to pop and shot a helghast in the head!!

3) Amazing guns which have great detail, kickass reload animations and great variety. I especially love the Electric gun. AWESOME. Shame you can only use that gun in one level.

4) Very stable frame rate. Despite all the explosions going on on the screen, things never slow down during the action. There have been some complaints about the small freezes while saving checkpoints. These always happen before the action and never interfere with game play. Guess what? Gears of War 1 and 2 had the exact same thing and no one ever mentioned it!!! Xbots....

5) Very epic story spanning and entire battle. Similar to Call of Duty games, you really feel like you are part of a huge comflict. THis was one of the problems with the first Killzone game. It really felt like a small conflict--mainly due to limitations with the hardware..

Now the negatives

1)Difficult level is kind of high. This game has 4 difficulty levels. I had it on the second level through the entire game and died a lot. The last battle in the palace, I had to lower the difficult level as I died 40 times. Makes no sense that you have an entire game where you use a great cover system which you cannot even use on that final battle on the balcony.

2)Movement is kind of sluggish. If this game would have had the feel of Resistance 2 with these graphics and story, it would have been one of my favorite games of all time. As it is, you just move too damn slows sometimes and this just adds to the difficulty.

3) Unlikeable characters with poor AI of team mates.. Rico is an absolute IDIOT who pisses me off more times that not. YOU are going to spend lots of time healing this moron as he just runs right into gunfire. His dialogue is dumb and he would not last 2 hours without getting shot in the head by one of his team mates!!

As I only have the PSP Slim then I can not test the any other model.  In response to another reviewer here they say that the PSP symbol is not ""on"" the case but on a cardboard piece... so what?  It keeps people from scratching off the PSP logo from constant wear and tear on the outside of the case and for those that want to remove the logo without damaging the case are also allowed to do so.  I'll agree tha the ""Made in China"" etching on the front of the case is annoying.

Review:  Great case with solid feeling plastic.  Rubber insets are removable and I'm guessing it's so you can clean them because the PSP would not fit properly without them.  The latch seems a bit too easy to open and you may have to squeeze the case slightly to get it to latch back properly.  When the case is open you have full access to all buttons and hook-ups except the Wi-fi enable button at the top which is half-way covered.  The PSP Slim fits perfectly and the rubber backing is already designed to hold the extended-life battery but it appears even without the extended battery it would still fit nicely.  There is an extra screen protector piece that folds down over the PSP to 1) Hold it in place and 2) What else? Protect your screen.  When the case is closed you still have access to the L/R buttons, power/hold button, the DC in (charger) and video/audio out ports.  So you can charge the PSP while it is in the case and closed as well as start a UMD video, hook it up to your TV with the appropriate cables, close the case and enjoy UMD video on your TV.  A minor problem is the USB connection... while they cut the plastic out for the USB connector the plastic is simply too thick to allow the USB cable to fully connect into the PSP while it is in the case.

On a side note, I have the leather strap on my PSP that came with the PSP Pouch and this Case does leave room for that to stick out while still attached so it won't be a problem if you have anything attached to that loop on the bottom left-hand side of the PSP next to the video/audio port.",Not a bad case.,1212364800,11,,

It has a couple of misses, but it excels heavily in the places where it counts.  Star Fox Command is a fantastic handheld gaming experience.

The Star Fox team, after defeating Andross, has disbanded.  Soon afterwards, a new threat known as the Anglar has emerged.  It's up to Fox McCloud to deal with these foes, and there's no way he can go at it alone.  When you first go through the game, there's not really a whole lot you can do, and the story doesn't seem very satisfying.  In fact, the first time through the game the path you go is completely set for you.  The standard storyline is pretty short and easy.  The good news is once you complete the standard story you can choose different paths to take, and uncover several different endings in the process. Each character has his/her own storyline.  In short, the game will keep you busy for a while.

Star Fox Command definitely sports some fantastic graphics.  Perhaps even some of the best the DS has seen.  There's no slowdown, and the character models and storyboards are fantastically detailed.  It's far superior to Star Fox 64.  The graphics are just one of the high points of Star Fox Command.

One of the high points of Star Fox Command is the gameplay.  While in the past Star Fox has pretty much been your standard flight/shooter.  Before it was to kill everything in sight.  Now the gameplay has taken on a more strategic feel.  Just about everything you do is done on the touch screen for the game.  At first it feels a little strange, but the execution is straight on.  You'll have to plot out your ships courses and then fly to them.

This isn't to say you won't be doing any aerial combat. The game has a map mode and a battle mode.  When in battle mode it's basically the same as all-range mode on Star Fox 64.  This will mostly be used to battle bosses and shoot down enemies.  From time to time you'll have to do a ""chase"" mission. In these mission you'll have to fulfill special tasks, such as shooting down a missile.  The only thing the touch screen isn't used for is to shoot.  You'll use the face buttons (or directional buttons) for that.  Other than that, all your flying mechanics take place on the touch screen.

There are plenty of things to beware in a mission, however.  The objective is mainly just to kill all the bad guys, but there are plenty of ways you can lose.  If the Great Fox is destroyed, or the time runs out, or you lose all your spare pilots, the game is over.  It may seem like a lot at first, but most of the areas to fight your missions in are pretty small, and it's not so hard to deal with everything going on at once.  Of all these assets that could cause you to lose a mission, the only one to pay any real attention to is making sure the Great Fox doesn't get destroyed.

Star Fox also has multiplayer.  Up to six people can play off of one card.  Or you can go online and battle with three other people.  Multiplayer drops the strategic ploy, though and instead pits you in aerial combat against your friends (or online opponents).  Multiplayer basically consists of you shooting down your opponents and collecting the stars they drop.  It's on a time limit, though, so you have to work fast.  When the time runs out, the one with the most stars at the end wins.  Multiplayer is a blast, but there really should've been a lot more of it to go around.  There really aren't enough modes.

There's no voice acting in Star Fox Command.  It's mostly the gibberish you heard in the original Star Fox on your SNES. However, the game does allow you to record your voice using the DS's microphone.  You can say a few things into your DS microphone and Fox, while in combat, will say these things in your tone of voice.  It's really cool, but doesn't really enhance the gameplay any at all.  It's just a neat little gimmick.

Star Fox Command is a great game.  It has a couple of short-commings, but for the most part, it's a great gaming experience.  Star Fox fans should be pleased at the new strategic direction of the game, and the intuitive gameplay.

On the Positive Side

+The game looks absolutely gorgeous
+The strategic gameplay is fairly addictive
+The touch screen controls are great
+Extras after you complete the main storyline
+Different scenarios
+Recording your own voice is pretty cool
+There's Multiplayer

On the Negative side
-The main storyline is rather short
-The game is also rather easy
-Multiplayer is fun, but severely limited

In the end it's become one of those games that I can only judge on game play alone, and with that it has pretty much delivered. At this point, to be honest, I think only the most diehard fans of the series still care about the overall story. I pretty much lost interest with the third one. Still as disappointing as that game was it hasn't made me toss the series aside as a whole since it had it's moments. Since I got this on the Wii U I can say its not that different from the other versions. Visually its superior to the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions. Game-play wise the only difference I noticed is that the tablet is given map duty which does clear up the UI a bit. You can even play on the tablet which doesn't take away much since it looks really good on it.

So from the 13 Colonies we now end up the Golden Age of Pirates. Taking on the role of Connor's grandfather, a Welsh privateer named Edward Kenway. Something I appreciated about this game in particular was Kenway who seems to be a much better character than Connor was. Since this one is based in a time period not to far behind from the third game there are many game-play aspects that are pretty similar. You've got your signature daggers, your pistols, smoke bombs, etc etc what only seems different inventory wise is that he duel wields his swords and a dart gun you get later on. Though despite that the combat feels a lot smoother than it did in the third game. Another thing that is different is architecture. This Golden Age of Pirates has a lot more to offer in regards to climbing and jumping off from than Colonial America did. Everything on land is pretty much a debugged version of the third with a few goodies added in like side missions.

Probably the strongest part of the game play though is sea faring. The best part of the third game was brought back and beefed up.  I can't really recall how many hours I spent sailing the Jackdaw (name of Edward's ship) around. All I can say is that it was a lot. As soon as I was given the ability to free roam over the whole map, I completely dropped out of the story all together. Instead I went on to raid British convoys at sea, destroying Spanish forts, obsessively tracking down every bit of treasure I could find, even going out into a rowboat and hunting sharks. Finally I had sunken every legendary ship, destroyed every fort, treasury was overflowing, and had nearly driven the large sea fauna to extinction that I begrudgingly went back to the main story.

Then thats where it kind of fell off. If there is one thing that really bugged me about the main story game-play it was the ""tailing missions"". These bits of game-play have been in the series since the first game but it seems as though Ubisoft has done little to improve them. In fact it feels as though they have gotten worse. Step out of the circle you lose, get seen by a single guard you lose. Also as stated earlier the main storyline (aside from Edward's) is just not very interesting. Especially when we see Edward slowly turn into another dogmatic assassin. It got the point where I only did main missions to unlock new toys to play with and as soon as I got them I'd disappear into the ocean again. Though like in the third you are interrupted by the world outside the animus though it's no where near as annoying as the Desmond missions.

Overall the game was very fun. You can sink a lot of hours into the side missions and mini games alone without having to go back to the main story which while better than the thirds still leaves a lot to be desired. If you want to play a nice open world game that you can invest quite a bit of time into, this is one you can sink your teeth into. The naval game-play is awesome and I was happy to see this brought back. In the end I'd recommend it.

The Good
-Game-play, there is a lot you can do and battles at sea are very fun and entertaining
-A lot of room for customization regard weapons, your ship, and other things
-Visuals, graphics are great from the very lifelike port cities to the open sea

One thing that is nice about these is you can plug them into a regular headphone jack and listen to music if you wish.  The sound is really good and for the money you pay for these you get a good pair of headphones.

The days of having a chord plugged into your consoles are long gone, and I'm glad.  So many times when I was younger, I recall playing video games and having someone trip over the chord because they were in a hurry to get by.  This usually resulted in the console falling to the floor due to the force in which the control chord was pulled during the process.  Now, none of my consoles have ever fallen onto the floor since no one can ever trip over the chords.

The Xbox 360 controller is great and feels extremely comfortable.  The two analog sticks have a nice grip to them, and the shoulder buttons are easy to access due to the curvature of the back of the controller.  The controller's curves make it easily fit the shape of the player's hands, and the positioning of the battery cover is out of the way yet still also gives your fingers something to rest on providing extra grip.  The four face buttons are a nice size, and the even spacing between them allows for quick hit and release and transition from one button to the next.  This is very beneficial in games that require large combos where the button range is widely varied.

The center Xbox button allows you to quickly access the dashboard.  Once on the dashboard you can either sign in/out, load music, turn off the controller, turn off the system, and tons of other extra features.  The controller runs off of AA batteries.  A complaint that many have against the controller.  However, I find this to be a major plus for the controller.  Simply purchase rechargeable AA batteries for under 20 dollars and you won't have to worry about constantly throwing away batteries.  Since the controller does not feature a built in battery, this also means that you don't have to worry about taking the controller about to change the battery once it no longer holds a charge.  Instead, a simple change in rechargeable batteries and you're good to game again.

The d-pad is rather awkward, and its design is my only complaint against the controller.  The d-pad is built exactly like the one found on the Sega Genesis.  The Genesis had a bad d-pad and this also reflects on the 360.  In fighting games especially is when you notice just how bad the directional buttons on the pad are.  In Street Fighter, for example, Ryu's special move is done by pressing down, down-forward, forward + Punch.  On the 360 d-pad, it sometimes mistakes the down for a down-forward, and the forward sometimes even for an up-forward.  This is the only problem with the controller, otherwise it is very stellar, very durable, very reliable, and free of all chords.  You can't go wrong with this controller, and you can't go wrong with choosing it any color either, I chose the black due to personal preference.",No More Wires,1258934400,,,

What makes this game so wonderful is not in how it is played, but in how it follows the script. The huge world of the Colossus will overwhelm the imagination with wonder, as you gallop your way on horseback to multiple destinations in hunt for each gigantean monster: Up and down scaling mountainsides; across expanse fields; in between dark valleys; cutting through dense forest; bustling through immense deserts. And as you slowly come to know this mysterious, mystical, but somehow ominous world, you will encounter remnants of previous human dwellings, such as the ruins of ancient temples carved out of the bellies of mountains, particles of arched bridges perched above the surface of calm, lifeless waters, shrines, sacrificial altars on cliff sides, mysterious pillars laid out upon grassy hills. The land is so dismal and dreary in its lack of inhabitants and unattended buildings that it is a pictorial definition of what it is to be Godforsaken and Desolate. You cannot help but feel you are in a world that rejects your presence and condemns interaction with humanity in it's entirety. All you hear throughout your journey in this vast region is the hooves of your horse hitting the gravel as it runs and the wind whistling through the canyons. We are talking about a game hammering the highest degree of style. I mean, my God, what an experience.

Aside from the mysterious and haunting locales within this vast landscape, there is the Colossi themselves to top off the brilliance of this inspiring game. There is nothing quite like the feeling of finding one. All are well hidden. They lay silent and dormant within the deepest parts of the rocky canyons. Some hide within the ruins of cities forgotten by time. Some within the earth. And some, beneath your feet, in water or in ground. No matter where they hide or how frustratingly long it takes you to find one, you will be awestruck with your encounters with them. They are huge, like walking mountains. The first time you encounter one you will always find some difficulty in defeating it. They are challenging in such a way that you will be forced to approach each Colossi with a different method of conquering it. The threat of death is not really an issue here, since most of their attacks are easily avoided. Jumping and climbing is key to winning most of the battles. You often must use the environment around you to distract them or expose their vulnerabilities. A great mix of puzzle solving and action, I thought. Although I wish the Colossi had more theme songs, the songs they DO have are performed brilliantly and I have yet to grow tired of them. They coincide with the epic battles perfectly.

Story-wise, this game seems simple at first, until you match it to what happens at the rather long ending (stay tuned even after the credits). It will put you in a position, as another reviewer had previously stated, where you don't know what is good or bad. I will not spoil it for you, but I understand now why some people have admitted to coming close to crying and why forums on the internet have been made to discuss the true nature of our hero, the girl and the Colossi themselves. Evidently, I am not the only one who sympathized for the poor beasts.

My biggest, and probably only complaint I have with this game is its stack of unanswered questions. Yes, the mystique may play a vital role in the quality of your gaming experience, but the curiosity is just too much. I would have liked at least a quick draft of the land's history and why so many of these buildings lay scattered in ruins and empty. I now understand the Colossi and what they are and why they attempt to kill (I had to study the game's ending to obtain this answer; typical Japanese story-telling is almost always inconclusive and leaves an array of possibilities for the viewer to consider). Maybe the game could have been better if the land had included other forms of intelligent life such as other lonesome travelers, or maybe a reclusive tribe, or perhaps an alien race. Could have worked if done right, I think.

But overall, this is almost a perfect game. I played through it three times since I got it a week ago. I am not recommending this game, I am telling you that you need to buy it now. That way, if it gets popular enough, they can make a sequel.

PS: By the way, the game ICO seems to hold a lot of relevance to this game, acting as a form of sequel.

*It offers a unique storyline
*It has unique gameplay (being born & VATS)
*The world is HUGE

VATS is good and bad. The good is ability to aim shots for critical damage (vaporizing an enemy with the laser rifle is the beast!).

Metal Gear Solid  Portable Ops its really a new experience. The controls, in firts place, are not so complicated as people use to say, and you get use to it with less effort. The history is just what you expect from a MGS game, and if you're fan of BIG BOSS (like I am) you have to buy it, for the plot that lead it, and to find your call.

I was disapointed about this game in two aspects:
 -First, the graphics are really nice, but there's an error in the eyes, that don't blink... That's a little annoying for me, that like to look the graphics and the faces. The expresions are statics, but the general graphics try to emulate as good as posible in the psp plataform the graphics of MGS3.
 -The other subject is the thing that they DON'T allways talk, they talk just in the story/comic like cuts and, because of I played the ps and ps2 ones I see that talking was a seal of MGS, I was just especting the same. You can live with it, the story/comic cuts are really nice and original, kinda annoy sometimes, but you'll love other parts when they just blow it up :3

 So basically, it's a great game. The online mode is kinda fun, and the way you can recruit and use soldiers from the enemy makes a good Idea how  foxhound was build, and how Boss became a leader.

You see, while the expansion packs add new gameplay, some of them also make the game more challenging -- or difficult, depending on your point of view.

You'll want to start with the basic Sims game, and optionally the first two expansion sets, Livin' Large and House Party. The next expansion set, Hot Date, ""upgraded"" how the relationships worked to make them more realistic -- in other words, more difficult. The Sims Deluxe contains the basic Sims game and Livin' Large. The Sims Mega Deluxe contains everything up to and including Hot Date, but the installation allows you to choose which packs to install.

At this point, you may wish to explore the internet itself for Sims add-ons! Many sites have new faces, clothes, houses, and even objects (some which allow you to cheat!) that you can install. (For these add-ons, installation means downloading files and copying them into your Sim folders, not installing from a CD. Unfortunately, installation is more difficult than installing from a CD.) Many houses and objects require expansion packs, so once you've played around with internet add-ons, start thinking about the expansion packs. And, yes, from the internet you can find all those lovely cheats to ""help"" you play the game -- or you may be inspired to create your own skins, houses, and Sim add-ons to share with others.

I should say that you don't need every expansion pack to enjoy the game. I haven't even touched my copies of Hot Date or Vacation because I don't play the ""virtual relationships"" aspect of the game. My personal recommendation is, interestingly enough, the last expansion pack, Makin' Magic, if only because MM has spells which bypass tedious parts of the game -- ie. cheat! :D",A Quick Sims Buying Guide,1120608000,2,,

Unless you are a pre-teen or have unusually small hands, this controller is comfortable and ergonomically designed. I like the slightly different button arrangement than the S-Controller (or PS2) diamond layout. The problem with this controller is that (1) there are too many gamers that are used to the PS2 controller, (2) there are plenty of children that play video game consoles, and (3) third party Xbox controllers (such as Mad Catz) and the new S-Controller use the diamond button configuration. The button configurations are different enough that you can get messed up switching between the two.
I think more and more people will migrate to the S-Controller or other third party controllers, and that this controller style will slowly fade out.

The levels are vibrant and very colorful. Wii motion controls are cleverly used and amazingly nice and intuitive. Be careful not to fall off the edge and fight a boss at the end of each one of the ten levels. The levels get progressively difficult and quite challenging (some very difficult, esp. the bosses). To add to it, there is a time limit on levels.

The game also has 50 mini games of varying difficulty and goals - most with simultaneous multi-player capability. The variety is so much that you'll always like / dislike something. The great thing about it is that you don't have to do anything to unlock these games. You can play them just from the mainmenu even w/o playing the main game. A lot of these are good fun like the good old arcades (bug balance, hurdles race, jump rope, submarine, space attack, snow surfing, racing, banana thief etc) but with wii motion controls.

When I played Silent Hill for the first time I didn't like it. I tried it again a few months later and then got hooked. My favorite of the series is Silent Hill 2. I found it creepier than others and better overall in storytelling. The worst in the series is Silent Hill: The Room. I still enjoyed it but wasn't as good as the others. Silent Hill 5: Homecoming now is my second favorite of the series (I haven't finished plays Origins yet).

Silent Hill: Homecoming is really about the next door neighbor of Silent Hill called Shepard's Glen. Don't worry it has plenty to do with series.

Such as the Order, and way the nurses react to light and move.

4.0,False,"08 16, 2007",ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000P46NKM,David Swan,"As a longtime fan of the Battle Network series and owner of all six previous games (which I played the heck out of) I feel fairly qualified in commenting on the latest evolution in the series. The name has changed and all the characters have been replaced but it's clearly Battle Network and it would be absurd not to compare it to the previous iterations. Let me start by saying that my initial reaction was concern. I hate the name Starforce, the font on the cover art looks cheap and dated and I quickly found a couple syntactical errors in the story text. However, once I got into it I was increasingly impressed by the quality of the production. First I'll address the nuts and bolts.

There are cosmetic changes and gameplay changes but perhaps the biggest alteration is in the battlefield. The three quarters top down view has been replaced by a 3D straight on shot with a three by five grid reducing the real estate by one row from previous games. Megaman sits in the near row while enemies have four to move around in. Is this an improvement? Maybe not. It creates a claustrophobic feel in battles although some weapons like swords have become significantly easier to use thanks to the new lock-on feature. After awhile the updated battle arena began to grow on me.

There are no longer different letter versions of battle chips which simplifies the game, it just doesn't improve it. Program Customizers have been replaced with Brotherbands that offer Megaman new abilities but without the customizations of the Battle Network series. The biggest killer is the removal of Program Advancements which were, in my opinion, the best part of the Battle Network game. There is a new feature called battle combos that I suppose replaces the PA's but the feature seems rather awkwardly designed.

Starforce has a lot of short sidequests although the rewards tend to be likewise small. The core game has a slight graphical upgrade and a decent if rather unfocussed story (what Battle Network game doesn't). Although the backgrounds are all redone the environment is pretty much the same as Battle Network with a small neighborhood, a school and a bus to other cities. It all boils down to collecting chips/creating folders and battling Navi's. I love it but I can't fault other who find it tiresome after 6 previous games.

My biggest issue with the Battle Network/Starforce series is the lack of continuity and what I mean by that is the ability to trade between iterations. It's disappointing to spend so much time collecting battle chips only to get the next in the series and have to collect the same ones all over again. This is probably the main reason that a site like [...] gave Starforce a dismal 5.2 rating. The worst thing is that the series actually did this at one point. You could trade `retro chips' between Battle Network 1 and 2. If you pop a previous version of Battle Network into the DS and perform some tasks in Starforce you can get a special weapon but the weapon is rather mediocre and the player will likely only use it for a short time before something better comes along. Pretty weak. I will continue to harp on this issue until it's corrected. It is the one glaring weakness of the series.

Reviews can (and have) slammed the series but there must be something in it to have such a loyal and active fan base. As of this writing Megaman has 3 of the top 7 DS FAQ's on [...] and 3 of the top 5 DS message boards which are exceedingly active. Despite my complaints I thoroughly enjoyed the game. My problem isn't that the series didn't change enough. My beef is that they changed some of the strongest elements. If Capcom ever does retro chips again I'll give the game 5 stars until the 4 is the best I can do.",Battle Network 7,1187222400,12,,

It brings me great sadness to inform you guys that despite being given Startropics for free when I was younger in 1994-95, I ended up selling it to Funcoland a few years later.  My reason is because the play control is absolutely horrible.  Unforgivably horrible.  It seems Mike, the character, doesn't jump or walk correctly at all and it's very awkward since I managed to work with many other NES games back in the day that eventually controlled perfectly fine after a little determination and a willingness not to give up too soon.  Startropics however, never cooperated.  It's not like I usually complain about play control in games either.  Other than the map screen from Skate or Die, this is the only other game where the movements gave me a lot of difficulty.

However it's 19 years later.  Things change right?  Yes they do!  I now realize that what I originally disliked about this game... well the play control is still really bad unfortunately, but I'm now more willing to work with it due to the fact the internet has shown me the error of my ways given the many reviews expressing enthusiasm for this game, and that Startropics is actually a decent game after all.  It's basically a little charming island adventure and nothing more.  The dolphin quest near the beginning basically confirms Startropics is full of charm, though after experiencing this little moment of happiness, it may surprise some that the tone and intensity of the adventure changes drastically later on.  It's mostly a linear experience though, so for people who love Crystallis and the Legend of Zelda... this game might not be for you I'm afraid.  Maybe the characters are memorable enough to persuade Crytallis and Zelda lovers to check out Startropics though.

Speaking of Zelda, this game shares quite a bit of similarities to the first Legend of Zelda.  You have a heart meter for one thing, and while it only happens occasionally, you even pick up heart pieces too (cleverly hidden throughout the islands instead of after defeating a boss).  You battle snakes and ghosts in the many dungeon-like caves that totally feel like they were copy and pasted out of the first Legend of Zelda game, but that's probably where the comparisons end because in Startropics you also have mummies, harpoons/blades coming out of the floors, rolling boulders, skeletons, skeleton heads, octopuses, bullets shooting all over the place and later on robots.  A very nice variety if I do say so.

The storyline about ""evil aliens"" coming to this island isn't much but it's enjoyable for what it is.  I love how you're mostly roaming around one normal island after another talking to different people before heading into another dangerous cave.  There's slight touches of alien or robot activity occurring every so often (such as your robot pal who can take you around the islands).  The characters are charming and more memorable than other games (even Zelda).  You'll be spending at least half of your time roaming the islands and talking to the townspeople.  The island theme is in full swing and well done, and the banana jokes are usually funny.  The music is AMAZING!  The credits them at the end makes me cry it's so beautiful.  Adding meaningful pictures related to your journey as the music plays here just makes the adventure feel even more fulfilling.

Anyway the dungeon-like caves are absolutely some of the HARDEST areas I've ever played in an NES game.  While these caves are normally straight forward with secrets that aren't that confusing to figure out, and while they're mostly short with linear paths, the challenge comes in a REALLY BIG way when you realize that simply taking one hit from an enemy knocks off 2 or more hearts from your life meter.  This means it's entirely possible to be dead in 3-4 hits.  Yes you have to be *extremely* careful how you approach the danger here, and unfortunately when the challenge increases in the second half of the game, you'll be raging quite often trust me.  The puzzles are surprisingly clever.  You'll be spending a significant amount of your time jumping Michael from blocks/switches to more blocks/switches, which dominates the majority of the cave puzzles.  These block jumps/switch steps are done in ways that can reveal hidden items or hidden important pathways, or something more approachable such as figuring your way across the other side of the room.

Overall I enjoy Startropics but it's not a game I recommend playing often due to the incredibly high challenge and atrocious play control.  The robots are relentless near the end too.  They will shoot and shoot and not give you any breathing room.  Expect flying pellets to come from all kinds of directions- not just the robots but other enemies, and it reminds me of Gradius quite a bit (and I never did particularly well in Gradius, heh).  At least your heart meter increases like in Zelda making it less stressful for the gamer since you're given slightly more leeway, but you'll STILL be taking all kinds of hits and facing all kinds of danger.  The game only gets harder as it goes on.  Also on another note, is this the first NES game to automatically save your progress before you enter a cave/dungeon?  I can't think of any other NES game that saves your progress automatically like that.

Boss fights are just as bad, if not worse.  Actually they're definitely worse because you can easily lose a life by simply standing in the wrong place at the wrong time, and get caught in a situation where your health goes down quickly.  Yikes! There's one boss where you have to jump across stepping stone blocks while avoiding his shooting pellets and it seems while jumping from block to block you're jumping *over* his attacks but a lot of times avoiding danger in such a way is completely unintentional on your part which makes me conclude you probably need luck on your side to master this game.  Because of these challenge problems, I really think Startropics is one of the hardest NES games available.  Certainly the hardest of the Zelda-like adventure genre.  Still, if you're open-minded enough to accept such a challenge, go for it.  This is a pretty awesome game despite the high difficulty.",tropical adventure,1406851200,,,

4.0,False,"08 9, 2005",AT576Z9DC6HJ0,B00004SPW9,D. K. Malone,"This game is about to get a lot of attention, more attention than it's had in the years since its Spring 2000 US release. Final Fantasy XII looms on the horizon, and it's the creative vision of Yasumi Matsuno. Vagrant Story is another of Matsuno's brainchildren. Once FFXII has been out for a couple of weeks and everybody's beaten it, a lot of those people are going to find out about Vagrant Story for the first time and go scrambling over to eBay to get a copy. This review is for them.

Almost everything about Vagrant Story is par excellance. The story, the script, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack... The English translation is especially spectacular, due to its masterful coloring with ""Olde English"" which adds so much flavor to the tone and atmosphere. This is one of the ultra rare cases where the English translation is arguably far superior to the original Japanese script. Unfortunately, all of these shining examples of fine craft and ""video game design as true art"" is all for naught because of one single fatal flaw: The game simply isn't fun to play.

Where the game ultimately fails is in the game play. First of all, the game is extremely focused. It's all dungeon crawling and fighting. There are no towns to explore and shop in, no NPCs to talk to, no minigames. Once you enter the dungeon, that's it. You will progress through different areas and get a change in scenery from time to time, but there is almost no variety in the gameplay. You move from room to room, you solve the occasional crate puzzle, and you fight enemies. End of story.

The battle system in and of itself is fine. It's an interesting hybrid cross between standard real time action combat and traditional RPG turn based combat. The problem is, at the very heart of the battle system is an abysmally UN-fun weapon and armor system. There are several (eight?) classes of enemies in the game- Beast, Human, Dragon, Undead, Phantom, etc. The enemy classes are paired off into diametric oppositions. e.g. Using your weapon against a human enemy will make it stronger against humans, but weaker against phantoms. (sic) On top of that, there are specific weakness ratings. An enemy might be weak against blunt weapons, but almost totally impervious to edged weapons or piercing weapons. And then there are the usual elementals as well- fire, ice, earth and so on. Finally, each of your weapons has its own ""wear"" rating. The lower the rating, the more worn out the weapon, the less damage it does. You must repair your weapons in workshops, which are few and far between in the game. Another thing you can do in workshops is disassemble your weapons and reassemble the parts to make new weapons. Whether the new weapon will be better or worse than the weapons you sacrificed to make them involves much trial and error. The end effect of all of this is that as you play the game, you are literally constantly changing weapons. Yet the creators of the game didn't bother to implement any sort of quick menu for weapon switching, a la Secret of Mana. You have no choice but to spend 45% of your game time opening the main menu, opening the weapon menu, finding the right weapon, opening the accessory menu, changing the elemental jewels on the weapon, etc. etc. etc. All they had to do was come up with some sort of quick menu for changing weapons, as Seiken Densetsu 2 did seven years earlier. As it stands, Vagrant Story is a micro-management nightmare. To call the game tedious is an understatement of epic proportions. There are those who insist that a viable alternative is simply slogging your way through the game using whatever weapons you happen to have, whether they're effective or not. It can be done, but it makes the game even less fun. Why anyone would want to take on a boss with several thousand HP by doing only 1-3 points of damage per hit is beyond me.

4.0,False,"03 16, 2016",A2MZ9IQF73JOM7,B017V6Y3YE,Shawn,"I have been a long time MMA fan and always enjoy fighting in MMA games that have been made. The first EA UFC game was a pretty good start and they did a pretty decent job with this one. Below are what personally I like about the game and then my issues with it.

The goods.
-Roster has an insane amount of fighters to pick from. Great improvement over last UFC game.
-Graphics look on point. The fights look amazing and so do the fighters. Some improvements made over the previous game for sure.
-Fighting feels very good. The striking is still a lot of fun, not too much changed in that area. The ground game is very different, still unsure if I like it or not to be honest. Feels hard to keep someone on the ground and really easy to get up but probably just need some more practice in this area. Submissions are same, just wish stamina played a bigger role, even when someone has no stamina they can escape just the same as if it was full.
-Ultimate Team is so far a lot of fun. Opening packs are exciting and keep you wanting more to see what goodies you will get. Creating your team can take a while but it is enjoyable to manage your team with their perks and moves. I do dislike that you have to manage each fighters ""stamina"" by equipping the card each time so they don't suck going into each fight.

Problems.
-Online is a lot of fun if you get the right person to fight. I have had plenty of amazing fights where it is back and forth and a war. But many times people simply run away the entire fight and will spam one single thing. In ultimate team, almost everyone seems to have the spinning head kick and they will simply run away and spam that if you get close, this is even more annoying as even if you block or hit them mid strike, they will clock you and almost always rock you with that one hit. Or you will get people that run away and once you get close they will spam clinch or takedown. Easy to defend but I got this game to fight people, not play a chasing simulator..

-Unblocked hits don't matter. So often I will be using a kick boxer against a wrestler and even when they have hands down taking a clean head kick, they seem to never drop. I can hit people with 10 of these kicks and still nothing. But here comes a jab and I slam to the ground knocked out.. Just doesn't feel right to me.

Verdict.

Even with those really annoying aspects, the game is great. Fights can be amazing, huge roster to choose from, and a lot of fun modes to try. The main problems are with other players that choose to play a cat and mouse game rather than an MMA game. If EA could fix the damage amount for unblocked hits that would be great. I would certainly recommend this game to any MMA fan, just warn them people online usually run away scared.","Great game, hurt by scared players.",1458086400,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's been more than 5 years since the world was reintroduced to the Street Fighter franchise through the Street Fighter IV Series (SF4). With a new generation of consoles Street Fighter V (SFV) seeks to create an E-Sport experience why finally connecting the story line and fan bases of the different Street Fighter series. With SF4 being the current champ, SFV has a lot to live up to, and in some ways it does, while in others ways, some will say it suffers for being rushed out in order to make the Capcom Pro Tour and biggest Tournament in the world, EVO.

Gameplay 

The gameplay of SFV is a throwback of sorts. Gone are the one frame links, focus attacks and extended combos from SF4. Instead we have a game that feels slightly faster with attacks that feel more deliberate, there is more of a commitment as throwing out light punch in succession is not a powerful option like (SF4). The combos are shorter and the damage is higher so it feels a lot like Super Turbo (ST) mixed with just enough Street Fighter 3 Third Strike (SF3) creating something that feels good at all times. There is no longer an Ultra system like SF4 so players are no longer rewarded for losing. The closest thing to a comeback mechanic is the fact that you can no longer die from chip out on regular attacks. So if you have no life but the character is still fighting, you cant lose on a blocked attack unless it is a Critical Art. SFV also brings back the stun meter and fan favorite feature from SF3. Its very helpful to new players and experience player alike to always have understanding of where your character is in terms of danger.

The newest gameplay feature in SFV is the V-Trigger/V-Skill system. This helps to differentiate SFVs already diverse cast even more by giving them individualized special abilities to take advantage of during the match. Ryus V-Skill allows him to Parry like in SF3 while, his V-Trigger makes his Hadouken Denjin mode causing more stun. Nashs V-Skill allows him to absorb projectiles and his V-Trigger has him teleporting around to get out of danger or extend combos. This system makes even characters that are similar like Ryu/Ken feel even more different and helps to individualize playstyles since overall SFV does have fewer options compared to past games. The characters only have one Critical Art which is the SFV version of the Ultra form SF4 or Supers from SF3, and of course the game has few characters overall.

SFV has 16 different characters, ranging from the standards like Ryu and Chun Li, the return of Alpha standouts like Karin and R. Mika, and four brand new characters. The roster may sound limited and feel unappealing considering there is a chance your favorite from a past game didn't make it in. But definitely give it a chance, all the characters feel different and viable and you might be surprised at what characters you gravitate to.

Story 

With SF4 Capcom walked all over any type of canon and continuity that they had between previous games. With SFV Capcom attempts to repair that, the problem is the main story isn't available and won't be available until June. So what we have in its place isn't even an Arcade mode. For some reason Capcom removed that and instead we have individual character prologue stories. The Prologue stories sound good on paper, as they are designed to set up the story and connections the characters have before the cinematic story is released and connects all the games up to SF3 in the timeline. The problem is the prologue stories for each fighter are 3 or 4 one round fights. Before the start and end we are greeted with static low quality comic book style artwork with voices speaking over them. It feels like a big downgrade from SF4 which features anime intros and endings. The style of the story is similar to MK in away as in that game you will fight with one character for only 3 or 4 matches before changing character or chapter. SFV would probably get less flack for the layout of the prologue stories if they had been more connected to each other and played in one session.

Graphics/Sound 

SFV is a good looking game, it is bright and colorful, with exaggerated character design that makes them look more cartoony similar to SF4. There is some clipping and some people have experienced issues with scan lines and screen tearing, but these cases seem to be few and far between.

The Sound design is better than past games. Also the English voiceovers are actually good and much better than SF4. You still have access to Japanese voices if you prefer and the music is fits the game very well. The remixes of classic themes really at to the old yet new feel of the game has going for it.

Play Time/Replayability 

In a lot of ways SFV is a barebones fighting game. The current story mode is extremely lacking, they removed arcade mode, and the only other single player mode is survival. Survival allows you to fight 10,30,50, or 100 fights. This mode is the only way to unlock character colors.

Trials, Arcade, Story, and other modes are supposed to be coming as free downloads in early March, but these items should have been available day one.

The online play works very well as most of the issues from the launch were fixed within a day or two. I've had over 200 matches and only experienced lag in about 15 of them. But again much like in 2009 with SF4, what is wrong with the online play is that there is no penalty for disconnecting. Capcom says they are working on a solution but this is not acceptable, in too many ways this game takes steps backs in terms of features. The current lobby system is limited in player count, there is no spectator mode, and no additional mode options like Team Battle or Tournament, etc Once again Capcom is supposed to be patching them in, but these should have been here day one.
What Capcom does do with the online is the Capcom Fighters Network (CFN). With CFN you can easily see all your stats and matches in one place. You can also view leaderboards, view and follow top players, and watch all their recorded matches.

Taking a moment to talk about DLC and feature disc. Capcom has made it a point to talk about how SFV will offer a service type experience. During the last generation with SF4 when the Super version came out, your vanilla SF4 disc was more or less useless as you could not get the new characters or modes without buying Super. Capcom fixed this issue with later upgrade releases being compatible with Super but you still had to pay for them.

This time around Capcom is offering players the option of buying all the DLC with Fight Money (FM). Fight Money is earned as you play SFV; you get it for wins in ranked online play, and for completing the story and survival modes. When the Story launches (again in March) you will be able to unlock additional characters and costumes with your FM. The problem with this system is that FM can only be earned when you are connected online. So lets say you are working through Hell mode in survival, If you lose connection then you lose all the FM you would have earned. Or if you have Fight Request on, and anything happens to your connection during that online match, you will be kicked back to the menu instead of your position in the single player mode losing FM again. Also lets not pretend Capcom is going to make this easy. They want you to spend money, so while right now the FM rewards are good and most of us already have enough to unlock the first DLC character Alex (From SF3), it is not going to be this easy going forward.

Final Recommendation 

Based just on the feeling you get when fighting Street Fighter V is an amazing game. The problem is the game was obviously rushed out to be EVO eligible for 2016 and it suffers because of it. The game is lacking features that cater to the casual market, as well as features that have become standard for the competitive market. So what should have been an amazing package feels lacking. Down the road when all the features that should have been day one are released SFV would probably be a 9 or 10 package, but based on what we have now, the game is merely very good.",Coulda been a contender for all.... instead of bum to some.,1456185600,,"{'Edition:': "" Collector's"", 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

4.0,False,"06 2, 2010",A1OUKEY9UYTV3H,B002BS47WG,David Allen,"I purchased Assassin's Creed - Bloodlines about two weeks ago at a warehouse store. I had looked at this game on line several times, but passed on it because I could not determine how the main character was controlled. On the PSP its important for the main character to be controlled completely by the Joystick nub, and Assassin's Creed Bloodlines does have this control setup. I took the chance when I saw it on sale, marked down to $22.

Assassin's Creed Bloodlines is an exclusive PSP only game. I have never played any of the other versions that are out for the other platforms, so I cannot comment on the story line as to where it fits in, but others say it fills in the blanks between Assassin's Creed 1 and Assassin's Creed 2 so you can take that for what its worth. As for the actual story line, in a nutshell, you play the part of the Assassin Altair of course.

Controls are fairly well laid out. The upper Left toggle activates the camera. When pressed you use the Symbol keys to look around. Pressing the Left toggle twice quickly puts the camera behind Altair. The upper Right toggle high profile movements like running. Normally the symbol keys are for attack, dodge, target, drop. On occasion these will be a special function like Talk, Jump, or Synchronization and will flash. The arrow keys are used to change weapons.

The story is broken down into Memory Blocks. Each of these Memory Blocks contains missions that you must complete to defeat the Templars. Your only weapons are your fists, some throwing knives, a sword, and a hidden daggar which is quite handy. As you move through the different areas, you can climb and jump a lot. The idea is to remain ""Hidden"". You do this by moving slowly, sometimes in a praying walk, so as to not draw attention to yourself. If you draw too much attention to yourself, you'll have to fight your way out of the resulting confrontation. You do have the ability to run, and there are hidden rooms and haystacks for you to jump into and hide. These in some cases can be used to hide from guards etc, but it takes forever for them to go on their way. Control of Altair is not good when you are running. The controls tend to over react a lot, and you find yourself zig zaging all over the place and drawing attention to yourself. Most of the game can be played by walking, but there are a few timed areas that you absolutely must run to beat the challenge. You can also take on odd jobs and tasks. As you approach different people, you'll see a symbol near them which indicated that you can communicate with them. They will hire you to perform special tasks for which you get paid coins if completed. There are also coins throughout the cities and towns that you can find. These are used to purchase upgrades. You do not have to get every one of them to buy all of the upgrades. The upgrades are essential for later in the game so in the early levels it's recommended that you go for the coins while the getting is easy, and do your upgrades as soon as you can. You begin in Acre Harbor Fortress which has been take by Templars.

Your first task is to rid the Fortress of the Templar's. Of course the tasks are very easy in the beginning. However, the instructions are not very comprehensive and a player can get stuck very early on and not know what to do. It is important to use the Map, and to use the Mission Parameters by pressing the Start button. This will tell you exactly what your supposed to be doing. The map usually indicates a red marker of some sort which is your goal. It can be a gate, or a safe house, or a target for assassination. They also have this one move in the game that you use a few times in the beginning then once near the end. Its called Synchronization. You will need to find the highest point in an area, usually marked by a eagle or bird like symbol on the map. You climb up this point and press triangle to synchronize. This somehow allows you to see what no one else can see in the area, like the location of safe houses. So be sure to synchronize when told to do so in the Mission Parameters.

You spend little time in the Fortress, and its quite easy to clear it out. You'll also be introduced to Limmisol, which has a cathedral area, a castle area, and a market place area. There are missions to be completed in those locations as well. You'll quickly dispatch all of the Templar's in the city and eventually find yourself on Cyprus. Again, here are several areas that you will need to complete missions in, and of course remove the Templar's. The tasks get more difficult as you play through. Most mission's are not exceedingly difficult, and a lot of fun to play. Take on a few side missions to earn extra coins. There are Boss levels in the game, starting out with an easy Princes at the beginning which isn't really a boss level if you ask me. Then getting more difficult as you get farther into the game. I believe that the most difficult Boss would be the witch. She is the first one that is a real challenge, she is fast, and deadly. This is another point I'd like to make on the game. Once you engage an opponent, its possible to break away, but you may not think so. When you are engaged to the opponent a triangle appears over their head. You must press triangle to disengage them before you can run or switch to a different opponent. Not as easy as it sounds. Altair's movements are relatively slow, and his attack method is always... slow. Swipe of the sword, back off, reset, attack again. It not a quick slash, slash, slash, which does make it harder to fight bosses and a larger number of opponents. Dodging, and blocking are therefore critical so make sure you learn how to do them. From the witch on the bosses are easier in my opinion. There are at least 3 critical timed missions in the game. The first is when the church is under siege, and you must dispatch of the rioters. That is not the problem, after you dispatch of 6 rioters, 4 archers appear on the rooftops with flaming arrows. You have 2 minutes to get to them all and take them out. The problem is three of them are fairly close to each other, but the fourth is way across the courtyard forcing you to drop back down to the streets where the rioters attack you. This was the most frustrating part of the whole game for me. This is where the running Altair control issue rear's its ugly head. Altair will get hung up on objects and you cannot get him off. Altair will automatically jump into a haystack as you pass it, taking up your time. When running he sometimes refuses to jump and instead drops and hangs and you cannot get him up again and you fail. He also refuses to climb as well making you fail. The second critical timed run is when you are assigned to talk to the monks at the church to get information. Before you can talk to the second Monk he is killed, and you are required to chase down the assassin across the rooftops. Again, the controls were again lacking. Altair would fail to jump, jump off the building, drop and hang instead of jump, and would turn wildly causing you to fail the mission. You have 30 seconds to get to the assassins lair and find an object. The third timed run is chasing an executioner. This one is the easiest of the three critical timed runs once you figure out the correct path to cut him off and take him out. There are other mini-timed runs that are very simple. At one point you have to protect the princes from detection as the resistance moves her through the city. You go ahead and take out the archers and guards. At various points the guards will approach the carriage and a cut scene shows you she is in trouble. Once you regain control, you have 30 seconds to reach the carriage and kill the first guard. Easy actually. The hardest part is taking out the archers and guards which are in odd ball locations that are not easy to get to, and you have to do this before the carriage reaches the final gate. Eventually after many missions, you will fight the leader of the Templar's, Bouchart. He is not that hard, just keep dodging and slashing and he will go down.

Over all I really enjoyed this game more than I thought I would with the exception of the 4 archers timed run. They needed another 30 seconds there. The controls are the biggest complaint. They are far too sensitive in run mode especially. Altair does not obey commands reliably in many cases. Altair gets hung up on items like a board or barrel that is only near him, and not touching him. Altair will automatically jump into haystacks, or drop and hang from buildings when you did not command that. The camera angle was lacking in some spots forcing you to use the camera adjustment keys to get a good view. Sometimes this worked against you, especially during timed runs. Graphics are really cool, I liked the medieval theme of the game. There were places where the graphics would tear, and you'd get these bright triangles or dark slivers appearing. There are a lot of people and guards going about their business. Many times you will see them standing face first into a wall and the feet moving like they are walking. Other times they will get hug up on nothing in the middle of the square or road, or you'll see them running in circles. In spite of those shortcomings I would recommend the game to others as long as they know that there are some minor issues.

Update June 15, 2010. I've just replayed the game again. This time I took more time to search the rooftops and find the coins, as well as taking more of the side jobs. I enjoyed the game much more the second time around. I think this is due to the fact that I had become more used to controlling Altair. There are still some areas where he goes in all different directions and you tend to overreact in trying to get him on the straight an narrow. But the battles were much easier as well as I had also honed my fighting skills. I was able to make it through the timed runs much better, particularly the attack on the church with the 4 archers timed sequence. The timed run with where the monk is killed before you can talk to him, and you have to chase the hooded assassin was still hard, but mostly because it was not clear at all where you had to go. Basically, when you get control back your facing a ladder. Quickly run and climb the ladder, run across the planks, jump the boxes, jump the wood beams, run up the ramp and jump off onto the roof below, run straight forward and jump over the rightmost pillar, and onto the next roof and go RIGHT to the edge of the roof. The hard part is getting Altair to jump the crates and then the beams and get onto the ramp without flipping down and hanging. Once you get to the other roof you get another 15 seconds. Your supposed to jump off near the wall onto the beams and follow the assassin from beam to beam to the alley at the end of the wide road. If you fall, do not worry, just run towards the big arch at the end of the wide road and just before you get to the side alley a cut scene will play, and you can then pick up the artifact the assassin dropped at the end of the alley. My score will still be a 4 star, but a strong four star. The key to enjoying the game more is to play it some and really get used to the controls. Knowing where to go during the times runs also helps so I gave the hint above. A very good game.",A Great Game But With Some Flaws,1275436800,4,,

4.0,False,"06 1, 2002",A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B00005TNI6,EMAN NEP,"Overall, Final Fantasy X is a good game--certainly better than any other RPG for a 128-bit console. However, Final Fantasy devotee that I am, I can't help but whine about several ""sins"" that Squaresoft has commited with the making of this game.

GRAPHICS: Instead of using adjectives, I'll just put it this way, sometimes you can't tell if you're watching an FMV or in-game graphics. They're that good. The FMV's themselves are almost as good as the graphics in the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within movie. Note the detail in the eyes, hair, etc. One thing that I'd like to point out that will GREATLY increase your enjoyment of the game is that fact that FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A FINAL FANTASY GAME you can ""save"" almost all the FMV sequences so that you can watch them again! Search the city of Luca, south of the save point.

SOUND: If your TV has really good sound (I have a Sony Trinitron flatscreen) then you'll be able to marvel at the realistic sound of grass crunching under Tidus' feet in the Calm Lands, etc.

MUSIC: This is where I start to dislike Final Fantasy X. The music is nowhere near as good as 9, or 7, or even 8. And definitely nowhere near as good as 6. However, there are a COUPLE good songs: ""Otherland"" (imagine Ifrit trying to sing in a rock band), ""Suteki Da Ne"" (Japanese feel to it, better than ""Eyes on Me""), and ""Summon Monster Battle"" (An excellent battle tune, but you only hear it once or twice). MANY times, I took out some of my other RPG soundtracks (Best of Ys, Elemental Gearbolt, FF7, FF6, FF Tactics), because their music is so much better. You can listen to the entire soundtrack in the same place where you purchase the FMV movies in Luca, another plus to this game.

STORYLINE: The very first scene is slow and boring--not at all like the openings to FF7, 8 and 9. But the FMV where Sin attacks--WHEW! AMAZING! Unfortunately, I found that the storyline in this game was dreadfully linear (along the lines of: Go to temple, solve puzzle, get aeon, go down road, go to next temple, repeat). You can go forwards and backwards, and that's about it--until you get to the sidequests.

BATTLE SYSTEM: Excellent. In previous FF's, certain characters got neglected because they were pointless to have in your party. In FF X, you can change characters in and out while in battle. In addition to this, FF X uses the Sphere Grid, which allows you to customize your characters the way YOU want to.

TRANSPORTATION: DREADFUL! YOU GET THE AIRSHIP, ONLY TO FIND OUT YOU CAN'T FLY IT! Instead, this LIST comes up and you choose from this LIST where you want to go. In the background is a world map, showing where you are and where you're headed. But you can't see where you're headed, because the world keeps spinning and the text gets in the way. You can ride Chocobos, but NOTHING beats a good old fashioned AIRSHIP! Flying the airship is one of the parts that every FF gamer looks forward to. Also, the Airship theme--while flying it--is usually one of the best in the game.

WHAT REALLY ANGERS ME: Playing the game for 60 hours, trying to get the Magus Sisters only to realize that you need Anima, but to get Anima you need a special item in this temple. But you can't GET to the temple (Bevelle). If you don't do it your first time, too bad. And the thing is, like Final Fantasy 8, you almost NEED THE most powerful summons to take out Braska's Final Aeon. Ultima, Flare, and Holy are not what they're supposed to be--they're rather weak and not much eye-candy. This game is VERY popular in the barracks where I live, but I know of MANY that have resorted to Cheat Codes.

CHARACTERS: Tidus is whiny and annoying, Yuna is little miss goody two-shoes. Auron is a copy of Toshiro Mifune in the black and white, Japanese, Akira Kurasawa movies ""Sanjuro"" and ""Yojimbo""--which is why he's so cool.

I found the controls to be oversensitive and the mini-games bordering on torture.  Every time I saw a computer I winced at the idea of performing yet another hack.  Trust me on this...you have to experience it yourself to understand.

Don't think that advancing in levels will make things easier.  The mini-games for lock-picking and hacking became progressively harder.  There is an ""Electromagnetic Pulse Grenade"" that saves you at the end of the game.  In truth, I bought more of those than anything else.

The other serious flaw is a saving system based on checkpoints.  This means that you may have just sneaked by 5 guards, and entered a room with 3 objects that require mini-games.  If you fail to complete a hack or lock within 12 seconds - the alarm goes off and everyone starts shooting at you.  The only way to get the alarm off is to bypass (another mini-game) the alarm system.  Remember, your reload point is two rooms away past 5 guards.

So as you can see the mini-game torture and saving system feed off each other.

IN SPITE OF ALL THIS - I STILL FIND THE GAME FUN.

Positive:

The plot-line is addictive, and because it's hard - I feel incredibly accomplished when I actually survive through a level.  The voice acting and music are both well done.
Each group of combatants have their own fighting style and techniques.  You can buy intel for your missions, or go in blind.
Every choice - even friends that you make - can effect how others think of you.  This game spent so much time on it's plot that some game mechanics suffered.  Quite frankly, I like having a deep plot line that can change so drastically.
The Video cut-scenes are pretty impressive.  Especially considering the models they are working with.

We've all been spoiled with Mass Effect 2.  If this game had the mechanics and art of Mass Effect 2 - it would have been the game of the decade.

Personal Summary:

I'm glad that I bought this game despite my misgivings.  In truth, Alpha Protocol is a game you have to experience yourself in order to judge it.

I read reviews and thought the game would be yet another let down in the RPG world.  Despite this - I gave it a chance - and I'm glad I did.",I gave Alpha Protocol a chance...and I'm glad I did...,1277337600,6,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
4.0,False,"03 27, 2008",A1WM97HIZTKY62,B000XJD33Y,Adam,"Don't get me wrong; this is a great improvement on the classic series in some ways. The new controls (which could only be done on the Wii) are perfect once you get them down, which shouldn't take very long at all. The mini games (which are also the boss levels) are a worthy addition as well.

About the controls: like any Wii game worth owning, the controls are unique to this game and must be learned. I know some people hate having to learn something new, and prefer doing the same old thing over and over again, so this game may not be good for those people. However, the controls are VERY easy to learn and most people can expect to pick them up very quickly. Others may struggle some, but the problem there is not the game...

If you're new to Worms, the first thing you need to know is that it's very ""hit-or-miss,"" meaning that people either love it or don't care for it at all... most people end up loving it though. It's incredibly unique, comical, really violent yet not violent at all at the same time, and it blends strategy with real time action in a way that no other game has. This release was geared toward you new comers, making it the easiest Worms ever to learn. I would always recommend Worms to anyone who hasn't tried it yet and thinks it looks interesting.

However, I've been a fan of the series since before it was even available in the US and I've played many different installments over the years. This is, in a way, a new breed of Worms. The animation and controls are unlike anything we've seen before and honestly I love them. The only problem is that this game was made to expand their target market, not to please current fans. I say this because, for a Worms game, it is extremely easy and fairly shallow. I'm rather surprised at how few levels there are and how similar they all are in style. I feel like there should be at least 5 more utilities to choose from (there are only 15 which can get old a bit too quickly) and there could be a lot more customization options too. This isn't a DS version... this is a Wii game and as such, it should be absolutely brimming with these things. After all, the variety was what made the repetitive game play so fresh when you keep coming back for more. I get what they were trying to do with the whole space theme, but I far preferred having one level in space and the rest of the levels all designed with completely unique styles from each other. I'm pretty sure they cut some of the variety that Worms fans have come to love and expect in exchange for disc space containing all of the animation that is worked right into game play (even the background seems to come alive). But the most important thing you'll probably want to know is that veterans can expect to beat Story Mode in about 7 hours, which is absurdly short. The reason for this is because it is by FAR the easiest Worms adventure you've ever seen. I breezed right through the first 3 worlds, which is half of the game. I'm about to finish the whole game and I just bought it. The customization does not live up to the standards that had already been set; you don't get to give your team a name and you only get to name 4 worms. I remember a time when you could have more than 4 worms on a team, and it was a lot better. It seems like this release also offers a lot less voices than usual, though the options that do exist are pretty good (narrator is probably my favorite). Open Warfare for the DS lasted me longer than this. In fact, that has A LOT more to it... which is really confusing to me. How can that even be possible considering the difference in the total amount of information that can be stored? Online play would have more than made-up for this, but they chose to ignore an incredible opportunity. I really wish I knew why they opted not to give people what they so obviously want (the ability to wage war with complete strangers around the globe) but if they had, this game would have had far more lasting appeal.

One thing that both veterans and newcomers should know is that unless you've got a really big TV, a lot of this game is too small. I can't even tell what I'm looking at sometimes. Also, the camera controls are extremely buggy and sometimes won't register at all, wasting valuable time for my turn. I really can't understand how they let it hit the shelves without fixing that first because seriously... it's really bad sometimes.

That has been the case with virtual pets and Pokemon. Going back to the 90's, that has been a very popular trend. Although many peopl have honestly thought that was definitely going to fail. Ironically, when Nintendo released the DS system last year, they just really haven't found a game that would definitely appeal to all ages. Although they have had some good games like Meteos, a revised edition of Super Mario 64, there just hasn't been something for all pet lovers to really enjoy. Now, there is something for them to enjoy.

Nintendogs for the Nintendo DS, is the latest answer to virtual pets. The game features a variety of loveable dogs that you can make them do tricks, roll over, and chase their tails. The dogs are vurtually adorable and have the unique appeal you'd see dogs have in any pet store. The graphics in the game really do come out very well, within each detail of all of the canines, while the music might be cutesy and sometimes too annoying. The control for all of the editions is very simple to maintain within the stylus, and definitely can be maintained simply with the turn of the hand. With each dog, you can also get special treats like collars, and pet toys and make them do special tricks for more funds as well.

All in all, when I got to try the demo edition of this game, I honestly thought this would be very interesting to try and own. I was right. Nintendogs is a great game for all Nintendo DS owners young and old, and for those who want a dog, but just simply can't afford it.

Extraction Point</a>&nbsp;was a decent expansion, though lacking in some respects (shorter, uneven spooky moments, but with many more environments to explore). -- see the end of this review for Windows 7 info.

This is about equal to ""Extraction Point"" - it's longer than ""XP"", there are new enemies and weapons, but the horror element is very uneven. The graphics and sound are just as good (slightly better, actually), but the plot is minimal - not that FPS games really need a plot. The original had spots that would make you jump the first time you came across them, and this does as well, though overall the tone is uneven - parts of Perseus are straight ahead killing, while others pour on the creepiness. You play a different character than the original, but you still have the SloMo ability, which doesn't make sense as far as the storyline goes.

A few new weapons in this one, such as the Grenade Launcher, the VES Advanced Rifle and the Lightning Arc Gun - of the three, the VES is a great addition, and there's plenty of ammo for it. The Grenade Launcher is nice, and sometimes very handy, but there's very little ammo for it.

A few new enemies, including the 'Demon in the Black Puddle' (whatever it's called) - add to the spookiness of the game. The Mercenaries and their wall-crawling counterparts are fun, but basic.

The ""spookiness"" levels range from 'none' to 'slasher' - there's nothing subtle about the paranormal sections of the game, aside from a few cutscenes. Monsters like the Demon in the Black Puddle are completely slasher (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B001NPD9LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th </a>), whereas others are a bit more subtle and more in line with the original game (the near-invisible underground cave dwellers are unexplained).

One cute thing about this is the 'Bonus Missions' - once you complete the main game, three new levels will be open to you. They're basically the F.E.A.R. version of single player deathmatch, where you run through a single map, killing all the way. But it means that you don't have to replay the game to get the same Thrill Kill, which can be a way to kill some time. Want the action without playing the entire game all over again? Play a Bonus Mission.

Pros: the same style gameplay as the original, slightly better graphics and sound, so you don't need to amp up your system unless you really want to. Perseus will play nicely enough on an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/nVidia-9500/dp/B001DL62EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">nVidia 9500</a>, but you may want to get something a bit higher up just to take full advantage of the game. The game has good replay ability, which is always a plus. It also has many more environments than the basic three of the original. It's a stand-alone, so you don't need to have the original installed in order to play this.

Cons: gameplay is still linear, point A to point B, no side trips or exploration. Your control setup can't be imported from the original. The spookiness factor is uneven - some level are very creepy, while others are boring and bland. Contains SecuROM DRM.

4.0,False,"05 20, 2007",ALR1CN6DL50DA,B00007LV7Y,Felixpath,"First I played Silent Hill 2, and it was one of the best gaming experiences I'd ever had -- so I rushed out and bought Silent Hill 3. Now that I've finished it, my final verdict is: Very good, but somewhat lacking. The third installment in Konami's groundbreaking survival horror series has better graphics, more monsters, a more coherent storyline, a better combat system, and more interesting environments -- and yet, it doesn't quite live up to the overall experience.

The thing is, Silent Hill 2 took a break from the mythology-laced storyline of the first game and went off in a totally different, Freudian direction. I found this change to be bold and fascinating. Silent Hill 3 gets back on track; our protagonist is Heather, a cheerful girl with strangely haunted eyes. She's at the mall on an errand for her father and everything seems normal -- except for her nightmare about being killed by a speeding roller coaster in a dark, twisted amusement park. Heather's day goes downhill from there; a detective named Douglas starts following her, claiming to have important information about her birth. She gives him the slip....but suddenly, the lights dim and the bustling mall falls eerily quiet. Where did everyone go? And why is the mall now crawling with horrifying monsters?

Here we see one of the game's biggest problems: considering that it's a Silent Hill game, it takes a awfully long time to actually get to the town of Silent Hill. The first half of the game chronicles Heather's attempts to make it home and evade the creeping nightmare world that follows her everywhere she goes. In the process, she starts to come to grips with the truth about who she really is. The religious cult that inhabits Silent Hill wants Heather for reasons I will not reveal, and two cult members -- the zealous Claudia and the enterprising Vincent -- are both trying to manipulate her for their own ends. The game's ""shocking twist"" is one that anyone familiar with the Silent Hill mythos will see coming a mile away. Still, the storyline is one of the game's strongest features, fleshing out Silent Hill's history and creating a complex and likable heroine.

It's in the technical details that Silent Hill 3 doesn't fully succeed. First, the game is too short and too linear. I finished it in just over six hours, which was disappointing. In Silent Hill 2, I loved being able to explore the town. In this game, as previously noted, it's a long time before the action shifts to the town itself. When it did, I was briefly ecstatic (The fog! That creepy metallic throb on the soundtrack!), but my enthusiasm faded once I discovered that you can only explore a small corner of town; the rest is blocked off. The other environments (which include the familiar Brookhaven hospital) are similarly limited. When you finally visit the creepy amusement park from Heather's dream, the game designers waste the opportunity to give you a large, rich environment to explore -- you don't even get a map, that's how linear it is. Aren't these games supposed to have endless replay value? The only reason to replay Silent Hill 3 is for the usual unlockable items and secrets. (Which, I hear, include a ""Sailor Moon"" outfit for Heather....please, say it ain't so...)

Overall, I think this game tries too hard to be bigger and better. Yeah, the graphics look great -- the ""dark"" areas are a nightmare of bloodstained walls, rusted metal, and ghastly forms squirming behind oily steel grilles, and one room in Brookhaven hospital provides one of the freakiest moments in the entire series (it involves a large mirror and an oozing bathtub). However, I found that the slick graphics lessened the atmosphere of horror; the muted look of Silent Hill 2 was far more sinister. There's a whole rogue's gallery of monsters to fight, but the creature designs, while disturbing, aren't really scary. The infamous Nurses have been given a disappointing makeover; now they just look like ordinary women having a particularly bad day, and the fact that some of them wield pistols only makes them more annoying to fight. Speaking of fighting, the combat system has gotten a major upgrade; Heather can even wield a weapon in various ways. I don't buy it; Heather's mad butt-kicking skills and the unlikely selection of weapons she finds seems a little too Hollywood. (A submachine gun is one thing, but a katana?!) Both the action and the soundtrack are dialed up several notches, and that's bad. Once again, Heather gets a handy radio that crackles with static when monsters are near, but Silent hill 3's beasties make such a racket that the radio is almost redundant. The best analogy I can think of is that Silent Hill 2 feels like a quiet little indie film, while Silent Hill 3 is like an attempt to remake the indie film as a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.

I'm not saying that Silent Hill 3 is bad -- far from it. The graphics are very impressive and vivid. The plot is nicely structured and will satisfy anyone who enjoyed the first game. The voice acting is better too, although it's anyone's guess why a native of Silent Hill would speak with a British accent. The puzzles are fun as ever. A happy(ish) ending is easy to achieve, and easter egg hounds will be pleased to know that this game, like the first two, has a UFO ending. Yes, Silent Hill 3 is a worthy entry into a standout series and many people will consider it the best of the lot. I just think that it tries too hard to be scary, when the previous games proved that less is more. Silent Hill 2 was a bold and visceral tale of terror, but with this follow-up, it seems like the creators have lost touch with their nightmares.",Doesn't Live Up....,1179619200,11,,

Campaign 4.5/5: this is hands down the best COD campaign ever. while modern warefare 1 and 2 and even the original black ops had great campaigns this is even better than those. the story shifts between cold war era and the future. the future is similar to modern warfare but just a little more high tech. the story is great and will keep you interested enough to beat the campaign. Your ending can be 1 of 4 based on choices you make during the campaign giving you reason to do multiple replays or simply watch all the other endings on youtube. there are strike force missons which play like RTS games but i skipped them.

Multiplayer 3.9/5: The biggest problem with multiplayer is the maps. while theres a good amount of maps there are only a handful of good ones. all the maps are made like mw3 and not black ops 1. that means camper heaven and the other huge downside is one side of the map tends to be better giving the team who spawns there a huge advantage. this can be downright frustrating when playing objective based matches. the guns are ok but no returning favorites from black ops 1. i wanted a futuristic galil so bad. oh well.

Zombies 5/5: this is the best part of black ops 2 and the main reason i bought the game. the new zombies is all about innovation while sticking to its roots much like what the other COD's claim they do. there are 3 modes with 1 large map and 3 small maps.
Tranzit: tranzit is basically the main map or mode of zombies. it feels just like the older games maps but of course adds a bus you can travel to 5 destinations with. you cannot control the bus but sped up or slow down the time when it leaves. the only map with tranzit so far is green run.
Green run (Tranzit only): green run has 5 stops. from the bus stop to the diner to the farm to the power plant to the town you will basically play zombies by defeating waves of zombies. however your old strategys from the old maps will not work as well. the mystery box( box where you can buy a random gun) moves to different stops once its used up making you rethink when you have to stay or go to the next stop.
Survival: classic gameplay with no stops or bus.
bus depot (part of tranzit): the bus depot is small. smaller than the first zombies map ever. its the first stop in tranzit too. since the map is small the mystery box never moves. its a very hard and challenging map.
farm: a farm and is the second largrest survival map. it too doesnt have a moving box.
town: the largest survival map which is a little bigger than the first map ever made. it has a pack a punch machine and is the only place you can pack a punch other than tranzit mode.
GRIEF: Zombies has its own take on multiplayer and you bassically have to outlast another team of 4 players. only town and farm are playable with grief but bus depot is through a glitch somehow.

It definitely is not anywhere as polished as are Uncharted 2 and 3, and it seems that the limitations of the Vita make it hard to create a game as ""epic"" as the console versions too. Still, quality definitely improved in the second half of the game, and there were times where I really felt like an action hero. Compared to the other Uncharteds, there were more opportunities for stealth and sniping in Golden Abyss, which are my favorite ways to take out bad guys.

4.0,False,"11 15, 2010",A2ZPZM9RE08JXF,B003ZHQH02,April,"Mario, Donkey Kong and Nintendo have long since gone hand-in-hand, from the very beginning of gaming. With this latest twist on these mainstay characters, in Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini-Land Mayhem, gamers are introduced to a rather unique experience and twist to the norm. In Mini-Land Mayhem, there is no jumping, head bopping or ball throwing from Mario, as we have come to expect from this little red overall-dressed man. Instead, there are conveyor belts to be built, warp pipes to travel and girders to place, among other nifty travel techniques to build and use.

Players must use their skills and wits, in this puzzle-based game, to construct paths which correctly guide mini wind-up Marios through different scenes and levels to reach doors to move on to the next stage/level. With this being said, players must react quickly because once the mini Marios are set to action, girders must be zapped and replaced in other areas before the Marios fall onto spikes and meet their doom. Also, once one mini Mario reaches the door, the rest must follow very quickly behind, before the timer runs out. Therefore, the player must have a ""game plan"" of sorts set in their mind before tapping on the mini Marios and setting them to action. A feature that I found very helpful, in the beginning of playing this game, is that after a certain number of failed attempts at passing a level, there will be an automatic help mode option that will pop up. Players can then tap on this, if they choose, and the scene will play out before the player, showing how to solve that level. This gives the player an idea how to play further levels as well, by setting in there mind ways to solve the puzzles. This option was incredibly helpful for me when I first began playing Mini-Land Mayhem, simply because I am not one to read instructions and am more the ""play around"" and figure out on my own type. This also aided me in realizing the strategy that I could apply in further levels of play. Remember, this is only an option that appears and players do not have to use this method.

Other features of the game are unlockable mini-games, several amusement park attractions and a special Donkey Kong level that can be accessed, after the player has cleared all other areas in an attraction. All of these variations are just within the game itself, thus, the tip of the Mini-Land Mayhem iceberg!

In addition to the single player game itself, there are virtually endless game play possibilities. The ""Construction Zone"" is an area that gives gamers the opportunity to create, play, edit and share their very own game levels. After a short tutorial, players can create their level using a variety of templates, game rules, characters, movable objects, backgrounds and several additional options. Once the player has created their level, they have the option to share it online, via Nintendo WFC. Here the player can store up to one hundred and sixty additional puzzles for game play, thirty friends and/or favorite creators and choose to use either a private or public upload, depending on who the player wants to view and play their creations. A maximum of twenty levels can be uploaded at any one time. Another facet to Mini-Land Mayhem is the ""Challenge Mode,"" where players can create custom levels based on certain rules set by Nintendo and then submitted to an online competition to be judged by other players.

As I mentioned earlier, game play and options in Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini-Land Mayhem is virtually endless. There is a possibility of further levels released by Nintendo in the future.  This is in addition to the included 200 puzzle levels already on the game. A gamer's dream.

I have to say that when I first received this game, my eight-year-old daughter grabbed it and off she went. In the beginning, she was a bit frustrated (yes, she is like me, no instructions, just right to the play aspect), however once she figured it out, she played and played and now loves it. Next, hubby got his hands on the game and is also hooked. Finally, I was able to snatch it away from both of them to have a bit of one-on-one time with my Dsi and Mario and Donkey Kong. I, like my daughter, went through that frustration stage, then once I caught on, was hooked. For me, Mini-Land Mayhem is one of those additive games where you continuously say to yourself ""Okay, one more level..."" then that one level turns into two, then three and before you know it, an hour has passed! Amazing.

I do want to mention that, while I enjoy the traditional Mario games, I have never been one that was enthralled with them. I become frustrated with games easily and, lets be honest, I just suck at trying to get Mario, Luigi and whomever else across gaps, bouncing on mushrooms, zapping flesh-eating flowers with fireballs, etc. However, with Mini-Land Mayhem, there is none of that, well, there is the stress of getting that little wind-up guy to go the correct way and getting those girders drawn before the poor guy becomes victim to the spikes. This game, however, is more of a thought-process and puzzle lovers, as well as Mario/Donkey Kong lovers will quickly become attached to this latest and newest version of Nintendo`s Mario games. The only complaint that I have, thus far, is the fact that players cannot control the little wind-up Marios, as far as the speed in which they move. They are at a set speed and really the only thing that can be controlled is their destination, by using the movable objects. The speed of the minis may not always be an issue, except when one has already reached it's destination and gone through the door and the others are still on their way.

Overall, I have to say that Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini-Land Mayhem is sure to be a hit with a vast audience and age range. I know it is a new favorite at our house.

When you play 4 players, it can become very difficult to get through some of the levels, especially when you have to get through gears or falling things....and that part could get frustrating. I don't know that this was fully thought for some levels, as it will become apparent, and you may have to compensate for this by letting a couple of characters die and getting through with one or two. I don't mind it, but it should be noted. I do like the game play, it really is a lot of fun (for the most part) with more than one player playing. The graphics are fine and the new features are fun. It's nice to be able to freeze characters, and having 4 yoshi's running around at the same time makes for a very interesting time.

As for the pros, you get an all new greatly enlarged map that takes place almost the entire world.  The graphics are better and the units and buildings are interesting.  There is a technology tree now and the ability to purchase generals.  The biggest change is the introduction of naval battles.  It's pretty cool seeing your men throw grappling hooks on another ship in order to pull it close for boarding.

As for cons, each individual unit is exactly the same.  This is really puzzling considering Medival Total War II had unique units.  It really helped to add to the flavor of the game.  The AI is also still extremely dumb, even dumber than before.  Forgetting about the horrible diplomacy, they don't know how to run a battle.  It won't be uncommon to see them march directly into cannon fire or even better, destroy their own walls with a cannon.

In Your House: There Goes The Neighborhood, was made in 1996 and loosely but not entirely based off the popular 90s WWF PPV series, In Your House. It was the first WWF/WWE video game to be released on the Playstation.

Similar to prior WWF games that were made before it, In Your House is more of an arcade-like game and carries a heavy Mortal Kombat theme. The game featured digital sprites of all the characters, could only win matches by KO'ing your opponent and pinning them, and many over the top and unrealistic moves done by the wrestlers. The game featured 10 of the WWF's top superstars during the time of 1995-1996. They were Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog, Goldust, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Ultimate Warrior, Shawn Michaels, Vader, and The Undertaker.

There's a mini season mode that you play in which you challenge for either the Intercontinental Championship, the WWF Championship or just fight with no prize on the line. The season mode is simply and again, very similar to Mortal Kombat in which you pick a superstar to play as and plow through the rest of the characters of the game to the very end and achieve victory. There are 3 rounds for each fight but you only have to go through 2 for each superstar if you manage to win the first 2 fights. If at anytime you're defeated by a superstar, you must start over from the beginning. You also have the option of playing regular one on one or tornado tag team matches (those are really fun) And there to call all the action is Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect. Every superstar in the game as their own personalized arena to fight in as well. And they're as listed

The Ultimate Warrior - Outdoor western-like locale with medieval soldiers/warriors spectators watching the fight

Ahmed Johnson - Gym locker room with exercisers as spectators

Goldust - Museum exhibition/movie theater with spectators

Shawn Michaels - Nightclub with bands and dancers as spectators

Vader - Rocky Mountains like arena with spectators

Owen Hart - King of Harts Throne Palace with royal king spectators

The Undertaker - Ghoulish crypt/lair with slime demons and grim reapers as spectators

Bret Hart - Stu Hart's Dungeon with students as spectators

Hunter Hearst Helmsley - Royal mansion with elegant spectators

British Bulldog - British park with spectators

There's a final arena in the game that's actually an In Your House arena with fans

Overall: Looking back on it, In Your House didn't receive too many good reviews as it was heavily criticized for lacking an actual wrestling theme and being repetitive. It's quite understandable in terms of repetitiveness as once you've played a few fights, you've pretty much played them all. That doesn't stop this from being a piece of retro fun though. It's fast paced and sure to entertain. Whether you're a long time fan of WWF/WWE or a new fan, definitely don't hesitate in picking this up and taking a ride back to the 90s","A Fun, Arcade-Like 90s WWF Game",1431561600,,,

The overall package of the game is great, Horde 2.0 is INCREDIBLE easily my favorite mode. The campaign is just meh. I expected a lot more, its short and even on hardcore pretty easy. I feel like more of the effort was put into multiplayer.

I think, that while it isn't as good as other Sonic games, it is fun and gets the job done. Alot of fans complained about Shadow using guns, and I do think that was weird, but it helped make the game unique from other Sonic games, and some of those guns really did help!

Other fans complained that the plot was too dark and serious for a Sonic game, but c'mon, this isn't a Sonic game, it is a Shadow game, and Shadow has always been the more dark, brooding character, what with his tragic past and all.

Finally, many fans disliked the main protagonist, an evil alien named Black Doom. I like him. In fact, I like him more than Eggman. I, for one, don't care for silly villains, and Black Doom is anything but, which is why I enjoy him as a villain more.

4.0,False,"02 5, 2014",A3TUS9UJI8C66N,B00AXI9XIE,DV,"Originally I had bought this game for the Nintendo Wii - which was a huge mistake. I ended up getting this a few weeks later on the PS3 and it was greatly improved as far as graphics and the game play.

I would say kids from maybe 5 or 6 until 10 or so will enjoy it the most.

The starter pack comes with Sully, Jack Sparrow, and Mr. Incredible as well as their respective ""play sets"", the game, and the dock. The dock, crystal starter, and characters can be used for any game platform. I was a little puzzled why Jack Sparrow was included in this set - some little kids haven't seen the Pirates movies and some of the missions might be a little hard for them. They really should have put in one of the Toy Story characters in this starter pack instead....but, it's only my opinion.

You can use any figure in the 'Toy Box', but only certain figures for their play sets. For example, while you can obviously use Sully in the Monsters University play set, you will not be able to use him in the Incredibles play set. This of course goes for the additional characters sold separately.

I've played all the play sets that been released so far with my son and they range from whatever your enjoyment is. Some of the ""missions"" can be difficult for some children, but are mostly fun and they come with some cutesy cut scenes for the game. Once you finish all the missions and complete the game, you can still venture into them, but there won't be that much to do. Each play set comes with these vaults in which you need ALL the characters available for that play set to unlock (for example for Incredibles, you'd need Mr. & Mrs. Incredible, Dash, Violet, and Syndrome) - nice strategy Disney. In those vaults, you can find decent extras to use inside the Toy Box that you can't unlock anywhere else. Overall fun really as each play set has it's uniqueness and if you're a fan of, say, The Incredibles, your child should enjoy it.

As far as the Toy Box goes, it's ok. A little limiting in some areas, such as space and how many ""animated"" things you can place. The ads for this game system are a little misleading in this case. There are several pre-built Toy Box worlds - some themed to show the variety available and some to represent the different play sets available for this system. For example, there is a Monsters University Toy Box world which is smaller than the play set but themed to the Monsters world with buildings and such. You can delete or add to these worlds as long as you meet the game space requirements of course. The toy box does generate ""enemies"" if you have a generator for that, so you can always have some fun with that. I can't see making your own game up in this, but you can position certain things in a unique way to your specifications - you can put the Monsters University buildings together with the buildings from the Cars if you want. Almost unlimited possibilities/combinations, but still limited as far as certain things.

You can unlock certain toys used for the toy box through the play sets and through spins (sort of stupid since it's also filled with things you won't need - be better to be able to choose what you'd want instead of a random spin/shuffle which gives you things you're not going to use). You can achieve more spins by leveling up in the toy box, completing mastery missions, adventures, or such.

The graphics are good enough and the music can sometimes be repetitive, but not terrible. Kids will appreciate everything if they're Disney/Pixar fans especially. Even if your child has not seen something like the Lone Ranger, they should still have fun in the play set.

One of the things I don't like about this system is the ""exclusives"" they signed with places such as Target, Toys R Us, Game Stop, Best Buy, and whomever else. It's kind of dumb of Disney to have made it a little harder to get some of the things you would want with this system....especially when it's not even a year old and they're really trying to launch it. I don't want to have to shop all over the place just to get some of the characters I would need. Forget online, because if you get something that was an Infinity Target exclusive somewhere other than Target, you'll be paying a LOT more than you should. Poor choice of Disney to sign those exclusives.

Another problem are the power discs. Sure, you can buy the whole set of a series for $60 (the lowest price at their exclusive location)...or you can pay twice as much online. Or perhaps you can try your luck with those $5-$6 bags that contain two pieces each - but you're likely to get doubles and in some cases, a lot of doubles. Yes, a classic scam to make money for sure. They should have sold the sets everywhere to make it fair or at least sell the discs individually, so you can choose what you want to get/use. There are two series' currently - each with ""rare"" pieces - with a third on the way. I'd say if you can find the set for $60, then get it. The bags are a mistake because any more than one, you risk getting doubles. If you get the TRU exclusive bags, then your risk of doubles increases.

Not the best marketing for Disney here and it's kind of irritating. Yes a known scam, but still doesn't make it right. You can find them individual on sites like eBay and even here, but expect to pay more than they're worth - especially for the ""rare"" ones.

As I mentioned in the beginning, do not get this for the Wii or DS - very limiting among other problems.

Bottom line, a fun system for kids and worth it for fans of Disney/Pixar. Hopefully they will release more characters and play sets soon - though I have read recently that Star Wars and Avengers were likely to happen as at least characters.","Fun for kids, but isn't perfect.",1391558400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PLAYSTATION 3'}",

4.0,False,"03 8, 2010",AOGRIMH5H12J,B001QXNBJM,Animal,"I finally finished the campaign and added it to the end of my original multiplayer review.  I have a good amount of gaming time with both franchises.  I was already a big fan of COD4 when I got BC1.  I was not impressed with the lack of class customization and felt it did not have much of a reply value so I went back to COD4.  MW2 is a great game but disappointed in several ways.  The turned up damage made shootouts short and unsatisfying.  No team coordination made playing without friends frustrating.  Select class combos made combat cheesy (Tac knife runner, Duel shotgun runner, Old javelin cheat).  I found myself more frustrated than having fun and decided to stop playing MW2.  My brother convinced me to try the BC2 demo and from that day I was hooked.

I wanted to point out a few highlights that separate this game from MW2 and BC1.

>The speed of the game is up to you.  Large maps and lots of cover will facilitate numerous playing styles.  There are a lot of areas that are less traveled and allow for flanking maneuvers or sniper spots.  You are able to wait in cover for extended periods of time allowing for more tactical movement or for the stealthy approach.  I've already been chastised for ""camping""; something severely looked down upon in MW.  The rules are different in BC, establishing a defense and eliminating a threat no matter what they are doing is the name of the game.  Things like establishing a kill zone or stealing vehicles disturb the enemy's operations tempo which is a viable tactic for victory.

>Kits are now better balanced and allow some customization.  Assault is the backbone for anti-infantry operations.  Rifles are good balance of power, accuracy and rate of fire (ROF).  They are able to carry a grenade, smoke or darts (shotgun) launcher.  They are the only source of ammo on the battlefield.  Engineer can play several roles.  They can repair vehicles as well as can carry rockets/mines to destroy them.  Their primary weapon is a silenced SMG, which is deadly for CQB and flanking maneuvers.  The Medic is the only source of healing and can revive downed teammates.  They carry a LMG and can be a very effective attacker or support gunner.  The Sniper can be an effective means of disturbing the enemy at distant.  They can specialize in a bolt-action for long-range kills or a semi-auto for more tactical ops.  They can be demolition experts with C4 or the mortar strike.  With the spotter scope they can provide quick recon data.  Although customization is not even close to MW, some options allow you to put different sights on your weapons, decide if you want to carry more ammo, have more accuracy or damage.  They now also allow any class to carry a small selection of shotguns, SMG and rifles.

>Vehicles can play a major part in your victory but are only as good as the support.  A dedicated engineer with infantry support can ensure a tank can last the fight.  On the other end a coordinated rocket attack or C4/mine strike could halt a tank's advance.  Depending on the map you can have a medium scale tanks battles and/or chopper support.

>Destruction is what sets this game apart from every other FPS you've played.  The battlefield is ever changing and you must adapt or die.  The game allows you to destroy almost everything and you find that good cover is a temporary convenience.  Destruction will continually present you opportunities or obstacles that will sway the outcome of battle.  A house that made for a good observation point maybe completely gone next time you go to it or a simple hole in a wall may become a vital sniper position.

>Sound quality is the finest of any other FPS I've played.  You will hear the echoing gunfire indoors and the explosions will rattle your eardrums.  Crouching is an important tool when you moving in the snow to walking up the stairs as you sneak up on your enemy.  Lastly, you will hear the crackle of every sniper shot that flies pass your dome.

>J-Rod, thanks for the addition.  The damage is another aspect that I think is done well in this game.  With a good eye and a disciplined trigger finger, you can drop enemies at range fairly easy with a non-scoped weapon.  At the same time you can play the rush, still take some good hits and continue to contribute to the attack.  If you're one of those guys that complain that its taking too many bullets to kill then the game does offer Hardcore mode.

Need to finish this with a few CONS:
-Customization has improved from the first game but still in the shadow of MW series
-Squads are limited to 4 people and may hamper large parties
-Servers problems can be frustrating, it may take several minutes or you may need to wait a while before finally joining a match (Hopefully this is fixed in the long-run)
  --To add to the server problems I have kicked from the game and it has froze on me 3-4 times

This is a longer review than I wanted but if I missed anything or need more data, please add it in the comments.  If you're new to MW2/BC2 please read the in-depth reviews of both games and ignore the 1-2 star spam.  If you think you want an arena type shooter and want something fast paced and always in the thick of heavy gunfire, MW2 way be your game.  If you want something that rewards on cooperation as well as kills, has vehicle combat and destructible environments, look no further.

(Update) I finshed the campaign on normal and it was not very long (~6 hours).  It comprises of 13 levels which all were very entertaining.  Although the backbone of the campaign comprised of close to medium range gunfights, it ensured that levels did not get too repeditive.  You get the whole battlefield experience, from run & gun to tank battles.  The game will allow you to be behind the steering wheel of several vehicles.  The level design is fairly linear but overall combat reminded me a little of Fry Cry.  In several parts you will be able to see your objective comprised of a compound or village.  Although there is only one way to get to the objective, you are free to flank and maneuver once in it.  Even linear scenarios have houses and other cover that allow to get the advantage on the enemy.  One thing I really liked is collectable weapons now serve a purpose.  At checkpoints there are supply points that allow you to swap for any 2 two weapons that you have picked-up in the game.  This allows you to adapt to the current scenario or to your specific playing style.  It is important as you play that you check weapon caches and weapons that were carried by your enemy.  Another side-quest are destroying M-COM stations.  The game will tell you how many there are on a map but it is up to you to explore the level to find them all.  Other than great combat, Bad Company comes back with fresh and funny material.  In this round it feels little more natural, finding the right time to make you laugh instead of throwing you one-liners every other minute.  The last thing I wanted to cover is difficultly and first play on normal was just about right.  Even on normal it was not an easy walk and remaining out of cover for 2-3 seconds ended in a quick death.  Enemy fire will cause you to take cover and shift your position as they advance and flank.  Like multiplayer, destruction will play a significant role on how you fight.  I've had my cover blown up several times and I even had a house collapse on me.  Overall, it was a great ride but a short one.  For those who are looking for a single player only, I would suggest something with a little more depth since you can beat this in a day.","How modern warfare was meant to be played, full review",1268006400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First of all, the graphics are stunning. They really put alot of work into the visuals and story, and it shows. The only way to play this game is with the lights off and volume blasted. I have never been scared by a game as much as this one(sorry Resident Evil and Silent Hill, not even close). Especially when in zero gravity and the necromorphs can come from any direction!

The game opens up a sense of creativity when it comes to killing the enemy too. Not only are head shots and body shots counter-productive, but using stasis and kinesis can make for some gratifying kills. Stopping a necromorph mid charge and throwing it into a gravity field is SO fun.

There are some parts that seem a bit tediously hard, like the asteroid shooting, but thats a small price to pay for such a well-executed game.

Gameplay: 5/5. The single player campaign is linear yet still fun. The story is predictable, but the funny dialogue makes up for it. The Multiplayer is incredible. Onslaught is a really fun DLC mode where you fight bots on the multiplayer maps. You need at least one other person to beat them on hardcore difficulty though.",Must have for shooter fans,1514160000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I played it often when I was a whole lot younger, but I never actually beat the game. The cartridge has just been sitting on my shelf for years and years on end...until I finally played it just a couple of days ago. That was when I realized once more that this game is easily one of the best original platformers on the Game Boy Advance!

Wario's adventure is not quite like that of what his less muscular, kinder counterpart goes through. This 2D platformer contains four worlds, but you can go to any of the four in any order, in a similar fashion to certain non-linear titles like Mega Man. There is clearly a lot of effort peppered into each and every level, as evidenced by each one's unique level designs and elements that make them stand out from each other. From an island to a factory to a volcanic mountain to a toy palace, Wario Land 4's environmental variety is, in a word, amazing.

Wario himself is more than capable of 32-bit platforming escapades, as the control is surprisingly even more fluid than in previous Wario Land titles. He can jump, crouch, bash foes, ground pound, and run/ram through enemies all at ease, and the brief and wacky powers he obtains from various creatures are also present and accounted for. The levels make excellent uses of Wario's abilities and the various things he can collect or use to his benefit. The secret-y areas for nabbing diamonds especially showcase that. And if that isn't enough to admire the level designs, the treasure-hunting scale of it all may. There's a TON of places for you to get of your way to explore and find some goodies!

At first, I wasn't too big of a fan of having to go back to the beginning of the level in a set time limit to actually complete it, but I've grown to really appreciate it during my revisiting the game. This is because, for the most part, there are new sections in the level that are exclusive to your running back to the start, effectively making the process seem less like backtracking and more like just continuing on with the level. The best example is in the volcano, where everything turns into ice upon stepping on the frog statue. You then use the frozen lava fountains to your advantage.

With some of the best graphics on the system, a memorable soundtrack, and all that awesome gameplay I've been rambling about the past couple paragraphs, Wario Land 4 is a highly recommended gem for anyone that loves platformers. The challenge may actually be demanding at times, but I assure you it's beyond worth checking out!",Greed is good,1425081600,,,

It also comes with a volume box on the wire where you can adjust the volume or mute your mic. From what my friends told me the mic sounds great compared to what I was using last time, I sound clearer and no static or background noise, the mic is very adjustable and causes little to no noise when adjusting it so you don't have to destroy your friends' ears when adjusting the mic. The cord on this headset is very long (on box says 2.2m), all I got to say is it's more than I need so I can pretty much walk around my room while still having these headset on. At first it may feel uncomfortable because you haven't gotten use to it but after a day or two you will forget that you have it on your head. So overall I find this headset to be a very good headset for people on a budget, it has everything you need from a headset for a very cheap price, I recommend this to all people who are looking to just find a headset to chat with friends in or out of game and if not it makes a very good headphone/earphones for watching movies or listening to music at night or whenever.

This just might be their best effort yet. Despite knowing nothing about the GOT universe, I was instantly drawn in by the tight storytelling and the amazing character development. I was very surprised by how deeply attached I became to the characters, after playing through this two hour episode (it seems like it goes by in about 30 minutes, however). I have never been this engaged by a game (even other Telltale games), and I have never before agonized so thoroughly over the tough decisions I was forced to make. Most telling of all is that when I completed the episode, I immediately wanted to start all over and try it again with different choices, just to see what might happen. I have enjoyed all the Telltale games, but I've never been so riveted that I immediately wanted to start all over again. The episode's conclusion really rocked me (honestly, it's crazy), and I imagine you will be even more affected if you're actually familiar with the GOT universe.

Music is okay.
Story is great and flows perfectly without all the jumping around for hours at a time.
Hint button is even better than others.
Plenty of puzzles to solve. Mini-games are perfect in that you can actually solve them with thinking.

After years of sequels, spin-offs, and certain imitators, Resident Evil 5 is here, like it or not. The story takes place a decade after the disastrous outbreak in Raccoon City. The Umbrella Corporation no longer exists, but bio-weapons are now being sold on the black market to terrorists. Not taking any chances of another biological incident, world governments have formed the BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance). Chris Redfield, now an agent for the BSAA, is sent to Africa to investigate a possible attack. If you've played Resident Evil 1 & 4, you know that it starts off as a routine mission that quickly becomes a nightmare. To start off, a lot of the mechanics are similar to the fourth game in many aspects from the over-the-shoulder camera angle to the combat system. The merchant is gone, and now you buy, sell, organize, and upgrade in a black market screen that pops up after you die, restart, or finish a chapter. One thing that's also new is co-op where a second player can join in and play as Chris's new partner Sheva Alomar online or offline in the room with you. Although I've not played single player, word is it's very crucial to find a second player for co-op, otherwise single will be a chore with the partner AI not being very reliable. The game also features beautiful graphics, unbelievable enemies, and certain characters fans should be familiar with which keep it all very interesting. For those commenting on the controls, this is not Call Of Duty or Gears Of War where you can run and shoot. Not saying those games are bad, I love them. But this is Resident Evil, the stand and shoot aspect of the controls have actually been around since the first game. Anybody complaining has probably never played a Resident Evil game. One thing is kind of a pain is the inventory screen which does not pause the action when you open it. However, this was in Dead Space as well, so I shouldn't complain because that's a great game. Nothing here should turn you off from giving this a try. Anybody looking for a great followup to Resident Evil 4 should be pleased.",Sometimes what you fear the most is the fear you can't forget,1237075200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The controller allows you to try some new techniques that make the game just that much more interesting.

As far as the play list, I was delighted to find so much newer music, as well as some amazing classics.

On the other hand, when I switched to hard, I was surprised to find how challenging it was, especially with the new controller and added techniques.  I love the new guitar battles, which are not really battles at all.  It is so much fun to play along with the likes of Ted Nugent and the other guitar gods.

There were some who couldn't excuse the change in the battle system, and there were others who disliked the overall tone.  Personally, I thought that the more political story of conflicts between the kingdoms of Ivalice was very refreshing.  And as much as I love the ATB systems of old the steps they made (far) away from random encounters made this game so much easier to stomach for long periods.

Make no mistake, dear gamer.  This is (or at least it can be) a lengthy game.  Beyond the main story quest, there are of course many sidequests to go on, and my favorite part of the game.. the hunts.  There are hunt boards located in certain areas of the game-world where one can sign up to fight stronger versions of standard enemies.  These feel like fun, optional boss battles that you can take part in.

This game is not without its flaws, however.  If pressed to come up with any, I guess the usefulness of the summons could be called into question.  I did however enjoy hunting down the various espers and fighting them as challenging boss battles.  Also, I guess they could have done more with their license board upgrade system, although I did like it.  And the soundtrack was good, but I wouldn't put it among the Final Fantasy greats.

This review is being written toward the end of 2013.  If you haven't played Final Fantasy XII at this point, and you enjoy this sort of game.. You have done yourself a disservice.

But this game has something about it that has me hooked, telling myself 'just explore one more area before I go to bed'; At work, I'm still thinking about where I left off and where I want to go next.

Maybe it's partly because this game reminds me of many of my favorite games: Bioshock, BLACK, Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War, Manhunt, Condemned, Silent Hill, and even Call of Duty 4...

The leveling up is fun, with lots of cool and morbid perks, from making your enemies explode when you shoot them to cannibalism when you need health; The freedom of choice is what makes this game so much fun...you build your character as you want, and make the game whatever you want it to be at any given moment; You can just explore for hours and actually enjoy it.

The action is pretty brutal at times, pretty tough even in normal mode; the targeting system is very unique to me and works great, esp the cut scenes that show what the damage is; the pip boy is a great way to navigate the menus and works fluidly once you get used to it.  Controls like a dream in first person, 3rd not so much; I use the 3rd person to get a bigger picture of wherever I am, but that's about it.

On the down side, the gray textures can become overwhelming; some might prefer something more colorful. There are some small glitches here and there--like my gun wouldn't stop firing one time even though I wasn't pulling the trigger, and it used up all my ammo; A few freeze ups and some frame skips too, but nothing on a constant basis. Just save often.  And the game starts slow....may turn some people off as you have to spend the first hour or so creating a character and talking to everybody.

But once outside, the world is yours to do what you want. I can't really think of a single thing they got wrong here with the exception of maybe working in a wider variety of creatures and enemies. And co-op would have been cool. But still, this is a must play in my opinion.

A key difference of ""real time strategy"" from ""city building"" is that the only reason you build your economy is to have the resources to build your military and your monuments. Another is that once you've defeated the other guy, the game ends. You can't keep building.

This has been an incredible few months.  First Ratchet and Clank, then Demon's Souls, and now Darksiders which is reminescent of God of War.  The overall gameplay better than GOW I think.  It is intense, fun and highly addictive.  There elemnts of RPG, Action, beautiful graphics of beasts and heroes.  The action is fastpaced and when you die you don't get so aggravated that you have to start from repetitious beginnings.  This game is so on cue with everything.

They couldn't have nailed it any better than that. The game begins with Wolverine's arrival in New York city to rescue a young mutant, Magma, who's being hunted by the Brotherhood of Mutants. Saving her sets a series of events in motion that lead to a cataclysmic battle of epic X-Men proportions. Legends lets you play as 4 of 15 classic X-Men(including my favorites: Gambit, and Nightcrawler)on a huge quest that will take up easily 30 hours of your life, depending on your skill level. While not perfect by any means, Legends is a meaty action RPG that will almost certainly please fans of the X-Men or of these types of games. Graphically, the game sports a cel-shaded look to give it that comic-book feel and, while it doesn't impress visually, it serves its' purpose in bringing things in the X-Men Universe to life. Control is very good for this type of game. It's all about battling, anyways, and battling here is fun and addictive all the way throughout.

Platform: WiiU
Genre: Adventure
Subgenre: 3D Platformer
Developer: Nintendo
Publisher: Nintendo
Released: November 22nd, 2013

When Super Mario 3D World was announced, I thought it would be a gimmicky, throwaway tech-demo title for the WiiU, much like Super Mario 3D Land was for the 3DS. I watched people play the E3 demo, and the demo levels looked simplistic and uninteresting. The cat suit threw me off, too. It seemed a bit out of place and a little creepy. However, as the release date drew nearer, the high-resolution screenshots made the game look really good. One the game released, rave reviews poured in. I decided to try it for myself.
3D World is one of the first games that I got for my WiiU, and it's the first one I played. My suspicions began to immediately dissolve as I played through the game's bright levels. The creative, beautiful, and genuinely fun levels kept bringing me back for hours of play time.

Story
For once, you aren't saving Peach (thank god). Instead, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad all have to save a race of androgynous fairies from Bowser's clutches. The plot is simple, but it's a Mario game, so you should know what to expect.
At the beginning of the game there appear to only be 6 worlds, and the first few take relatively little time to complete, leaving you with the impression that the game is on the short side. This is an illusion, as every time you finish a world, you end up unlocking a new one. There are actually 12 worlds in all, counting the final levels, so you'll be unlocking new levels far after the game has finished.
There's also a bonus character to unlock, but I'll leave that a secret for now.

Gameplay
3D World has some of the best Mario gameplay. First, let's talk about the controls. If you've played Mario 3D Land, you'll know what to expect, however if you haven't, it's a blend of 2D and 3D Mario controls. You'll largely be running in the cardinal directions, however you can move freely using the analog stick. Familiar 3D Mario moves return, such as the spin jump (a la Mario Sunshine), skid jump, long jump, wall jump, and more. One of the best moves is one where you hit crouch and run at the same time (LZ and Y on the gamepad), then jump (B) to do a somersault jump. This allows you the maximum distance for your long jump, and is much faster than a normal long jump. Basically, the controls are pretty fantastic. I found on some of the more difficult stages that they can be a bit on the floaty side, but most of the time you won't even notice it. You can play the game with the gamepad, a Wii remote, or the Pro Controller. The Wii remote wasn't all that great, but the gamepad was pretty fantastic. The game supports full mirroring with the gamepad screen, meaning that you get the same display on the gamepad as you do on the TV. This allows you to play the game fully without even turning on your TV. There were also a few things you could do with the gamepad that you couldn't do with other controllers, such as blowing in the microphone to move certain platforms or reveal hidden blocks and platforms. You could also use the gamepad's touchscreen to stun enemies, activate platforms, trigger ? Blocks and more. I found this to be a bit frustrating, because the game often wanted you to move and use the touch screen at the same time. I only have 2 hands, Nintendo. I can't do both at the same time. Still, if you play around with the touch screen and mic, you're sure to find neat ways you can use them to solve problems.
The game lets you choose between any of the four playable characters before you start a stage, so you can swap out depending on which character you're feeling. It also doesn't lock you into a character like the New Super Mario Bros games, so if you really don't want to play as Mario, you don't have to. Each character also has their own distinct differences when it comes to control. Mario is well-rounded, Luigi jumps high, Peach can hover in midair, and Toad is the fastest. This allows you to pick whichever play style suits you the best, and also makes multiplayer fun.
Some familiar powerups make their return in 3D World, including the Fire Flower and Tanuki Suit, however there are also some new ones. There's the Cat Suit, which allows your character to move faster, dive bomb in midair, scratch enemies, and climb up walls. At first it seems really overpowered, especially since you start wanting to climb every wall in the game to find any secrets, however I found it to be a welcome addition to the roster of powerups. There is also a Boomerang Bro Suit, which is basically the Hammer Bro Suit from Mario 3 meets the Cutter ability from Kirby. Essentially you can throw boomerangs to knock out enemies. Sokka would be so proud. The last powerup is a cherry that splits your character into protean clones. This powerup gave me extreme anxiety, mostly because it was hard to keep up with multiple clones, and levels often required a specific number of clones to get certain secrets. There were also a bunch of block powerups that your character can wear on their head, including an auto-fire cannon, a propeller, the gold coin block from NSMB2, and a light for ghost levels. I always enjoyed getting the powerups, with the exception of the cherry, and most of the time the game didn't force you to rely on them (except for getting certain secrets). There were some levels that were very hard without a specific powerup, but none were impossible.
Now, the levels. These were easily the best thing about 3D World. Remarkably, each level managed to bring a unique theme and experience to the game, and I would wager that all of them were fun. Some were frustrating and hard, but that never ruined the fun of the level, and not once did I want to give up (with the exception of the brutal final bonus level). Most of the levels were pretty straightforward platforming, but there were the occasional few that did something different, like one level that had a huge open savannah in which to run around. Most of the levels were structured like the challenge levels from Mario Galaxy, but with more platforming. One of my favorite things about the levels is that there are almost always multiple paths through the level, meaning that you can approach them from whichever angle suits you best (again, Mario Sunshine comes to mind).
Each level has it's own secrets to collect, namely three green stars and a stamp in each level, as well as a gold flag from reaching the top of the flagpole at the end of the level. These are often tricky to locate, and some require specific powerups to attain. If you take the time to nab them all, you'll get the most out of the game. However, they're hard to get in multiplayer, so I would recommend skipping them when playing with friends. The stamps can be used when doing Miiverse drawings in the game, a feature which Nintendo pushes very strongly. You can turn on Miiverse within the game, which will show posts that people have made after each level and in the overworld. These can be pretty helpful for finding secrets, but are sometimes pretty mundane. It's also weird to see people's Miis just floating around your overworld, and seems rather invasive at first, but you get used to it. You can also see ghosts of other players' runs through levels which you have completed.
The difficulty of the game seemed paced a bit poorly to me. The first few worlds are really easy, but they reach a cliff where they become much more difficult. However, there are a bunch of surprisingly easy levels mixed in amongst the tougher ones, so you'll be playing a really hard level, only to find that the next one gives you no trouble at all. This threw me off a lot in the bonus worlds, especially when the punishing final level came out of nowhere. Still, the levels are fun, so I can forgive Nintendo for having uneven difficulty.
Mario 3D World is revolutionary in the sense that it is probably the first Mario game to have a co-op mode that doesn't make you want to slaughter the people with whom you are playing. In the NSMB games, the screen advances with whoever is in front, and if anyone's staying behind to try to get a big coin, oh well. The screen pushes them off a platform or crushes them against a wall without so much as a warning. In 3D World, the camera zooms out if players are far apart, letting each player take their own path. If a player is lagging too far behind, the game will put them in a bubble which will move towards the other players. This can also be activated by pressing the L or R buttons on the gamepad/pro controller or the A button on the Wii remote. This allows less skilled players to opt out of difficult sections, and is a much less punishing way of moving them along than just killing any player that gets too far behind. Also, as it's a 3D game, you don't have the issue of players crowding each other on platforms and accidentally pushing each other off. Essentially, this game is much more multiplayer-friendly than other Mario games, and makes it fun to play with friends.

Presentation
The presentation is probably the best thing about Mario 3D World. Each level is bright and colorful, and looks fantastic in HD quality. The lighting engine for the game especially brings out the shine in the setpieces and characters, making them look almost real, despite being cartoonish in design.
The music for the game is beautiful, and features many jazzy pieces that give the music an exciting swing. I personally can't wait for the soundtrack to be released in the US. I was so glad to hear that there was barely any of the ""wah wah"" from NSMB. Interestingly enough, there was a lot of Mario Galaxy music in this game, not to mention a bunch of other references. Maybe Nintendo is planning a Mario Galaxy 3?
**TL;DR**
Mario 3D World is one of the best Mario games of all time. Seriously. It manages to blend elements of both 2D and 3D Mario games perfectly to make something new and fresh. Each level feels alive and genuinely fun. The music is a joy to listen to, and the visuals will continue to impress you well into the endgame. 3D World is miles better than the mediocre New Super Mario Bros U, and if you own a WiiU, you're really doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game.

Pros:
-Fantastic level design
-Beautiful visuals
-Controls like a dream
-Extensive amount of levels

Cons:
-Uneven difficulty
-Some bonus levels feel unfair
-Touchscreen controls feel wonky

I have been dumb enough to periodically waste money on some of the various third person games out there like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, but I hate third person and cannot get into it at all. Might & Magic does not have that problem.

This game is the third in this format after MM6 & MM7 and has the most tweaks. Some say the story and engine are getting a little long on the tooth but that is fine with me. I have become so engrossed it them that I have played all three of them at least three times each. There is no other game that even comes close.

Despite the crudeness factor, I love the graphics. The spell system is just right, and I don't mind all the monster bashing. The story kept me engaged each time I played, even knowing the outcome the second and third time around.

I just wish someone would continue the series in the same format with maybe 3-D graphics but the same game play and all the rest. I give a hats off to the Might & Magic Tribute people who are doing it on their own, since no company seems interested in doing it.

Highly recommended.",End Of A Great Trilogy,1174521600,2,,

The following review is my honest and unbiased opinion:

There are so many hundreds of different headphones on the market that it can be hard to decide which ones to buy. So I've created this little quiz:

Q: Do you want headphones for your smart phone?
A: If yes, then don't buy these headphones.

Q: Do you prefer earbuds?
A: If yes, then don't buy these headphones.

Q: Do you want headphones for your computer or laptop?
A: These might be for you.

Q: Do you want headphones for your computer of laptop that also have a built-in microphone?
A: These might be for you.

Q: Do you also want headphones for your computer or laptop with a built-in microphone and the ability to deliver BIG SOUND?
A: These are definitely for you.

While I know most people will probably use these for MMORPG gaming online where you need to talk to other characters, I've found them incredibly useful for Skyping, talking on Google Chat, and using other voice-over-IP clients. What's great about these headphones is that you can both hear and be heard. Also, they completely eliminate the annoying sound of keyboard clatter for whoever you're talking to! So this means that you can still use your keyboard when chatting online.",Totally Eliminate Sending Annoying Keyboard Clatter When Chatting Online,1447372800,2,{'Color:': ' Yellow'},

I'd already purchased Fantasy Life and was greatly anticipating playing it when the GI review gave it at 6.  Although it made me nervous, I didn't even contemplate cancelling my order.  I was that hyped for it!  I'm glad I kept it as I have never spent as much time in a game as I have this one.  Is it repetitive?  Sort of...Is the story not too overwhelming?  Kind of...but that must be good enough for me as I've played it for 410 hours now and still have 2 lives to Hero.  My problem is that I cannot resist mining every gem I see, chopping every tree, building every piece of furniture, sewing every piece possible and slaying every monster (except the sheep which I feel sorry for when they run away from me!)  I've put off ending the story because I'm enjoying running around fulfilling quests.  Undoubtedly the quests are repetitive but it makes me feel happy to fulfill them.  I'm bad at shooters and hopeless at games like Borderlands or the later Final Fantasys (all of which I try) and the level of fighting in Fantasy Life is about my speed.

Of the original games this game had a large number of ""easier puzzles"", but also featured a great number of puzzles.  If you're already a Layton fan, you'll know exactly what to expect - and if you're new to Professor Layton, you'll still be able to play the game without having see the previous two games, although you may miss little jokes and recurring characters popping in here and there.  Like the previous game, Professor Layton and Luke get to travel through various environments including Past and Future London, and they get to interact with a ton of characters.  The puzzles in the the game's storyline seemed simpler to me, but there were still some really good mind bogglers in there, particularly in the bonus section.  If you have the code from the previous game - The Diabolical Box - the bonus Anton sliding puzzle game is good and difficult.  I have yet to solve it, but I know I'll get to it...eventually.

The included Mini Games were a bit more difficult this game - particularly the Toy Car Challenge and the Parrot Delivery minigames.  The Storybook game was not quite as difficult, but I found it very charming.  One thing to note - you can no longer access the additional puzzles via WIFI, as Nintendo ended this feature in 2014.

In terms of story line, this was a particularly tear jerking story.  This was my favorite story line of the Layton Series, and I loved the interactions between Layton and Luke.  While the next three games are a prequel series for the Layton games, I am hoping there will be a sequel to the original Layton Trilogy...time will only tell.

That said, this keyboard is a joy to use.  If you can survive without the number pad - and you might not be able to - the feel of the keyboard is just awesome.  The backlighting is surprisingly fun and can be extensively customized once you install the Logitech software.  It's just a really great keyboard.

Once you've used a gaming keyboard and a gaming mouse, nothing else is good enough.  So I can also review this keyboard as someone who does a LOT of typing and tell you that it's absolutely perfect - except that I've had to relearn how to type numbers since I long ago gave up on that and memorized the number pad instead.

It seemed to take platformers to a whole new level, and it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I ever had with the PS2 console. It combined great humor, storytelling, platforming, combat, weapons, gadgets, and variety. The variety came from a number of tastefully implemented elements that broke up the gameplay, including using your Trespasser gadget to crack hi-tech locks, using Clank to control miniature ""Gadgetbots"" and solve puzzles, piloting starships in intergalactic battles, and even transforming into a gigantic robot to get into some arena-style combat.

More than anything else, this game got me HOOKED- I had to play it right to the end, and after that, I wanted to uncover all the hidden bolts, skill points, weapons, and gadgets. Never did I imagine that I would have as much fun when I went back to revisit RC with the RC Collection on PS3. But I'm happy to report that I did!

I CANNOT believe this game is TEN years old! It's true that it's been given the ""HD makeover"", but the content and gameplay mechanics are identical to the original. Even though this was the first RC entry, and improvements would slowly occur over time (such as strafing and an enhanced ""quick select""), this game has aged remarkably well, and it's still as gripping and fun as it was ten years ago. What's just as impressive is how incredibly GOOD this game looks. Nothing was ""rebuilt""; developer Idol Minds simply enhanced the resolution to HD and fit it to widescreen format. Yet, this game looks better than most PS3 games... and it's only a PS2 game!

I don't even play RE5 on PS3 even though I bought it, because I don't have the right mindset for it right now. I don't know much more than where the game stood from part Zero (this one) and part 2, but I know that both used the survival horror techniques that started the genre. From what I know also, the gameplay in current games have differed from this, some say for the better, I say not necessarily.

Now, I would first recommend getting this one because it stands as the best in the series in its classic form of gaming because 1) you get to spend time looking around and admiring the scenery that seems so authentic you can breathe it 2) live the music 3) because you won't go through x amount of lives by being bombarded with zombies so much in one scene 4) the enemies are NOT so overwhelming that you miss out on the rest of the graphic effects 5) it's not a repetitive game and the rest goes on.

This is the first RE that I went all the way through on, and what this typically means for the player is plenty of nights with the lights off and getting a feel for the story. It isn't too extreme, some parts pick up the pace, and overall it's a good game from one amazement to the next.

I think that the gameplay changed a lot with part 4 and 5 because the way it stood was a little formulaic in that the bosses got worse the deeper you got into it, up to a finale that depending on the voice acting you were either convinced by the story or not. From what I remember, everything was good in that respect, with part 0, making this the best of the classic REs.

Now, what I'd like to see is this game be released on other platforms, because a game like this does have some replay value after being away from it, providing a nostalgia. Even a PSP could probably handle this one.

There is a great how to on Youtube by user 'Playstation Customs' called ""How to Repair Dualshock 4 Analog Stick Input"" Using this video (and another video to learn how to take my controller apart properly) I was able to repair my laggy, unresponsive left stick on two of my controllers without having to solder. And I didn't have to worry about the seemingly cheap makeup of these cheap replacement rocker units. All I had to do is remove the burnt out motion sensor wheel from my original thumbstick rocker, then remove a motion sensor wheel from this rocker (there are x2 in each rocker, so x4 in each purchase) and place the new one into my old rocker. Cost me $2.

TLDR; If you're not afraid to spend an hour or so learning how to replace the motion sensors in your original DS4 rockers, you can fix a worn out controller thumbstick rocker for $2 (without soldering)

The 3DS was released two years ago and is only just recently reaching its potential. I've had mine for a year at this point and I can definitely say that I've noticed the number of people I encountered through StreetPass skyrocket in the past few months. I used to be able to walk down the street without picking up anyone at all. In fact, I went through the London Underground in rush hour and only had five hits. But now I walk down through my fairly small town and I pick up ten new people every time. It's made it almost tooo easy.

The reason for this surge in popularity is obvious. The 3DS was marred by a rather dismal set of release games that was dominated by ports from the N64 and PS2, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time/dp/B003O6E800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Fox-64/dp/B002I094AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Fox 64</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-of-the-Abyss/dp/B002I08WVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales of the Abyss</a>. It was the same way for the first year and a half as everyone tried to figure out what to do with it, with the strange 3D features and motion controls putting some developers off. Fortunately, the system got over that and now has its own unique games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Emblem-Awakening/dp/B00AKIPBNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Emblem: Awakening</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Link-Between-Worlds/dp/B00GANWVJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Link Between Worlds</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pokmon-X/dp/B0053B5RGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pokmon X</a>.

As to the 3DS in general, the system is basically the same as the DS with improved graphics. Why improve on perfection I suppose? That machine was a near-perfect gaming platform with many classic games. The graphics however, were often quite blocky and sometimes ugly. The 3DS improves on that although most games keep the unrealistic style of DS games. They just do it better, with cartoony graphics that actually look like cartoons. Some of the visuals on the 3DS can be pretty amazing, but there are few games that show them off to the full. I think that the graphics level is somewhere around that of the PS2, as can be seen in a number of direct PS2 ports. This is good enough for a handheld system and means we can finally get rid of the blocky little shrunken men that dominated DS games. It's not as good as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vita/dp/B003O6EATE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vita</a>, but since 3DS games are rarely about superior graphics that doesn't matter. Most of the best 3DS games would have worked just fine on the DS, they simply look nicer with better graphics. And that sums up Nintendo's strategy to a T: If it ain't broke don't fix it. And since the 3DS can do DS games better than the DS as well as play higher end games (Ace Combat looked pretty good on its screen) this system offers a lot more chance for expansion while allowing Nintendo to take few risks.

The big gripe everyone has about the 3DS is the 3D part. And yes, it isn't great. If it wasn't for the fact that I dislike the non-clamshell design of the 2DS I'd recommend going for that. But the problems with the 3D have often been overstated. Yes, it rarely adds anything to the gaming experience; yes it means you have to hold the system at exactly the right angle to see it; yes, it can sometimes cause headaches; but then you can simply turn it off if you don't like it. There's a little switch on the side that makes it dead easy. I don't know of any games that require 3D to function so you don't really lose anything. What I generally do is put the 3D off when I'm playing the game, but turn it on for cinematics. Because animated cutscenes in 3D look absolutely superb. Sometimes they has left me utterly blown away.

The motion control elements of the 3DS are similarly gimmicky, although I can see more potential for their integration into a good gaming experience. Under no circumstances should the two gimmicks be used together. The 3D is dependent on having the 3DS at a constant distance from your face, so if you have to move the unit around to use the motion sensors then you're going to get a headache quick.

Another aspect of the hardware that gets people a bit upset is the battery life. The 3DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself. The reduced battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics. There is no way around it. The one battery-related thing that does bother me though is that the sleep mode isn't very good at conserving energy. If you leave the 3DS sleeping for two days without a charge it will run out of battery. I assume this is related to Streetpass and could be resolved by simply turning the wifi off so I'm giving it a break on that score.

The 3DS comes with with a number of programs preinstalled including System Settings, the eShop, Activity Log, Nintendo Zone, 3D Camera, and Mii Maker. These programs are fairly self-explanitory and cannot be deleted as they are essential to the functioning of the system. I'm not particularly happy with the eStore. It seems rather clunky to use, and crashes frequently. It's nice that it can background download, but it makes everything up to that point far too difficult. The 3DS can play downloaded games rather than using cartridges, and the fact that it uses standard memory cards means that this isn't that difficult or expensive to do. A major plus over the Vita and its Vita-exclusive memory cards.

Also preinstalled are Face Raiders and Augmented Reality. These are both short games designed to be used with the 3DS's camera. They add digitally created figures to what appears behind your 3DS and allow you to, for example, shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls. It's pretty cool, and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since. The other game on there is StreetPass. This is a collection of two games (though they can be upped to six if you pay for them) that depend on you collecting other players' characters via wifi. As you pass another 3DS in the street you will automatically sync with it and their character will show up on your Mii Plaza from which you can play games. I don't know of any other system that has social gaming features that make you feel as involved as this. I understand that Japan has something similar with cell phone games and I believe there was something like it for the PSP, but over here the only competition is Vita's Near, and StreetPass leaves Near in the dust. There's just no benefit to using Near whereas with StreetPass you get to play games with people you run into, even if they're not involved any more than that. Rewards include hats and uniforms for your Mii character.

A major problem with the 3DS when compared to its predecessor is that games are now region-locked. European games cannot be played on American systems, nor can Japanese games. This is a real problem for me as I have a European 3DS. So at the moment I can't play games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shin-Megami-Tensei-IV/dp/B00C1ZBFTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a>, though I suspect that they'll release it in Europe eventually. Fortunately, the DS cartridges are still region-free and can be played in any system.

The 3DS comes in three versions: the base model 3DS (this one), the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3DS-XL/dp/B008GEH8LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3DS-XL</a>, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2DS/dp/B00EZPCX1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2DS</a>. Now, the 3DS is fine as a system, but its screen is just as tiny as the DS's. The 3DS-XL however has a screen that's almost twice as big while still fitting comfortably in your hand or your pocket. It also has a longer battery life, giving you perhaps an extra hour's usage. Even if you only want to use it to play DS games it's worth the upgrade. It is of course, the most expensive of the three options. The 3DS is somewhat cheaper and fits in pockets easier, but I personally don't like how boxy it is. The 3DS-XL is all smooth lines and is only slightly bigger when you consider the increased size of the screen. But if small size really is important for you I'd go with the 3DS. The 2DS is really only for people who don't expect to carry it around in their pockets. The one-piece construction makes it stronger, but it does mean that it is less protected and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in. The fact that it doesn't have 3D isn't much of a loss. I have friends who swear by the 2DS, and I can see its advantages, but if you expect to bring it everywhere I'd go for one of the other two options.

To sum up: the 3DS is an excellent gaming system that improves on what didn't work on the DS while keeping all of the features that worked. If it features gimmicks like 3D and motion control they can be easily turned off or ignored. It's a small price to pay for quality. Anyone wanting a portable gaming system has no reason not to turn to the 3DS. I was never a fan of portable games since I came to them back in the days of Gameboy and Game Gear when 2D sprites were the way to go and difficulty settings often unforgiving. But the 3DS has made a convert out of me and consumes far too much of my free time. Definitely recommended.",A Very Nice Handheld Console,1389139200,15,{'Color:': ' Black'},

I have only used to other types of switches; the brown mx switch(Cooler Master XT) and the buckling spring from the older IBM i use to type on and own. This mechanical keyboard is one of the better keyboard options for the price range, and I have done a lot of research looking into different models and brands that one could possibly buy. I would say the QFR is the top of the charts as far as overall feel and quality at the price point, and when I first received this keyboard I have had experiences with it's full size version the XT and I happened to love cherry mx browns and the cm XT as a keyboard could not be much better for me. This keyboard has more of the same rubberized finish that gives it a matte like texture that feels pleasant to the touch, and the steel backplate which the keys bottom out on, instead of only having the pcb for the keys to be mounted onto. I has mediocre key caps( being abs plastic with pad printed legends) but for the price of the keyboard being such a decent quality you could easily replace the keycaps and possible buy some pbt and or double shot abs keycaps. Having this would basically make this one of the best tenkeyless compact keyboards for what you are paying for, and yes you could spend another 40-55 bucks on a FIlco and get great build quality with the prestigious brand. What you get with the rapid is a keyboard built from same company in Taiwan with similar quality for a significant price reduction, and I do not think you could go wrong with this purchase unless you are looking for macro keys, backlit keys, and something a bit more flashy. Then I would recommend something else, but myself I am looking for minimalistic look with solid design and structure. If you are looking what I was then you cannot go wrong with QF Rapid, and not to mention depending where you order you can get a grey model or black, and then you also have a wide gamut of cherry mx switch types. So, all in all you can have a great tenkeyless keyboard with either red(light linear), black(firmer linear), brown(light tactile with no audible click), blue(tactile with audible click right before actuation), green(firmer tactile with audible click) so with these options you have a decent amount a choices. Now, if this is your first mechanical keyboard and you happen to be coming from a rubber dome keyboard, I would recommend a brown switch, red, if you have a heavier hand then perhaps black, and if you do not mind the audible noise then a blue is nice to type on too. I happen to like every switch that I have tried for different reasons on this keyboard I have the blue mechanical switches, and I have not regretted it.","So, Cooler Master has done something right with this keyboard",1386979200,,"{'Size:': ' Small', 'Color:': ' Rapid - CherryMX Blue'}",

Unfortunately only a modest handful Dreamcast titles took advantage the V.M.U, like Jet Grind Radio, Power Stone, Shenmue and Street Fighter Alpha 3 among others that added extra features or mini games.

5.0,False,"06 15, 2009",A19OUUT4SWU7GH,B000UU3SVI,Aaron Keating,"Here it is in a nutshell.

Before this game I didn't even know Bethesda's name as a gaming company. I barely knew of the Fallout games even existing.

I heard alot of love going around for Fallout 3 so I decided to try it out for myself. I was expecting, like a post 6 Final Fantasy game to be severely let down wondering what kind of drugs people must have been taking to have enjoyed it so much.

I was nothing of the sort. Mass Effect had become my Gold Standard for what I want out of an RPG game, Fallout 3, I think has just trumped it in all departments but one.

As far as sucking you into the game world goes, despite it being a post apocalyptic world you find yourself pausing to admire scenery, and just roaming about for the hell of it. You'll actually -enjoy- exploring this world and boy is there alot to explore. You almost feel as if you had been living in a Vault all of your life, and then having left it seeing the world for the first time.

A game is nothing without Rock Solid gameplay, and Fallout 3 doesn't fail to deliver at all. Grant it I would have liked to have more special abilities, (you know things like psychic powers and what not but whatever) but there's alot of ways to make differing characters and not just from the looks department.

Fallout 3 does what games like Final Fantasy have Failed to do, for Six games now, it has no classes. And yet, each character that you make can be wildly different from another. Even with overlap. Infact it is quite likely that is going to happen unless you strictly plan out each character to be identical! There are enough skills in the game and not enough points to max them out.

You read that? You don't Max out. (I am told you can, but it requires effort for the 360)

Controls are tight, though they could use some work in Non Vats Mode as far as movement goes. The controls work, and really don't get in the way. Makes for good gameplay and it delivers here too.

There's tons and tons of side quests. Infact, if you so chose I believe you'd get 70 hours out of -one- character if you did all of the side quests and it actually seems to affect the game world! I like all of the little side stories... so it's hard to pace yourself to save some for your next character.

There's no real loading times so no issue there either.

Okay so what's the big problems?

I have two and only two. One of which appears to be somewhat random in if it will affect you or not.

Glitchy game... very glitchy. My friend's had a great many glitches with this game getting stuck on invisible rocks, or holes and cant' move etc disappearing people that sort of thing. I have yet to have this issue but I have heard it more than often enough about this game that it's probably a matter of time before it gets me too.

And the main story, is kind of a let down and predictable.

Unlike Fable II, I hear it's post game content is actually good (once you get Broken Steel you can play it after you beat it). I'm not quite there yet, but I'm far enough along that I was disappointed with the story.

I played Black Flag (AC4) and my god that was terrible. I almost wanted to go back and beat AC 1 after playing Black Flag - I at least would have been more entertained by the repetition of AC1 than the terrible story of AC4 (black flag).

5.0,False,"05 28, 2016",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00GODZYNA,Tsanche,"I'm having a tough time deciding how much I like Uncharted 4. On one hand it's got one of the strongest narratives and does some of the best storytelling the video game medium has seen for a AAA game. It's got great characters that are well developed and spends a lot of time really diving into its themes and challenging the perception we have of the characters. On the other hand, while it's a really fun game to play there are some aspects to it that can feel overdeveloped. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but these aspects can affect gameplay. That being said, however, Uncharted 4 is a good game. One of the best outings for Nathan Drake you'll find and one of the best stories the series has. If this is truly the last Uncharted game, the series has definitely gone out with a bang.

The game takes place several years after the third installment. We see Nathan Drake adjusting to a ""normal"" life. He has a salvaging job, is married to Elena (our heroine from the first three games) and doesn't really go on a ton of adventures anymore. It's clear that Nathan Drake misses the thrill of adventure. All of that changes when his brother, Sam, who was presumed to be dead, shows up needing his help. In order to help his brother, Nathan is going to have to go after the treasure of an old pirate named Avery.

As with other Uncharted games, the story on the surface of Uncharted 4 is a relatively simple one, but the depth and meaning come through in the characters and their motivations. Uncharted 3 begged the question as to whether Nathan Drake was sane for enjoying all of this thrill seeking. Thrill seeking that, as he comes to learn, has a cost when he nearly gets his friends killed. Uncharted 4 dives deeper into this theme and asks, what's more important to Nathan Drake. The people he loves or the thrill of adventure? The third game is largely about his relationship with Sully, but here it challenges his relationship with every main protagonist. Is Nate going after Avery's treasure to save his brother or is he actually going for the thrill? The game decides it's going to take a deep dive into just who Nathan Drake is and what's important to him. And while Uncharted may be going in a more serious direction it doesn't abandon its pulp fictional roots to do it. That doesn't mean that the changes is entirely perfect all the time. There isn't nearly as much clever or witty dialog present here. Uncharted 4 has very strong moments, but the game is much lighter on humor than the first three games. Some of it feels like an attempt to make Uncharted darker and more serious. The good news is that while the game isn't quite as funny as the first three, it still prefers to take its characters seriously in the situations they're in.

The story is told through a lot of gameplay and cinematic cutscenes. Uncharted 4 is definitely the most gorgeous game I've ever seen. The way the characters move is almost lifelike. There are also a lot of colorful vibrant places throughout the game. Animations move with a lot of fluidity and it's surprising that throughout all of this Uncharted 4 doesn't buckle under its own weight. It's also accompanied by a great music score. While I miss Nate's typical theme from the first three game, the new arrangement of it is still really good.

There are a couple of moments where Uncharted 4 is nostalgic for the previous three games. While I don't mind references or bringing back memories of the first three games, Uncharted 4 does a lot of it from time to time. It seems done in an attempt to say goodbye to Uncharted by reminding us of all the places we've been to. It's tasteful, at least, it just feels overbearing at times just how much the game insists on reminding us of the previous adventures instead of getting on with its own. When it is moving forward, though, it's brilliant at doing so. The story keeps going, only slowing down to build character. The game also seamlessly blends its cinematics into its gameplay.

The Uncharted games have always been simple experiences in terms of gameplay. The best trick the Uncharted series ever pulled was blending various gameplay elements from other game franchises and creating its own through that. Uncharted 4 brings back as much familiar stuff as possible. You pick up two types of weapons. Sidearms and rifles. Sidearms are guns like pistols and revolvers while rifles are your assault rifles and shotguns. You'll engage in several shootouts where you can take cover and pop up to shoot every now and then. You can also toss grenades and move from cover to cover as your enemies either destroy your cover or flush you out by tossing grenades of their own. This formula has worked for Uncharted for a while and it improved significantly as each game moved forward. But the Uncharted series isn't just about gunfights. From time to time you get a break from the action and you're able to catch your breath and either solve a puzzle or climb up mountains and walls in the climbing sections. You'll also find yourself jumping to other planess. A lot. You'll also be able to drive a jeep at some points and even sail a boat. This keeps things varied and keeps the game from being monotonous in gun fights.

There are new additions to the gameplay at least. Stealth segments are here too, but they're a lot better than in Uncharted 3. In Uncharted 3, stealth segments worked in a manner that one screw up was enough to get an entire mob after you with reinforcements. Here, Uncharted 4 opts to use a bit of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid and other stealth games. In various locations there is tall grass and places to hide. You can mark enemies to know where they are and avoid them. You can sneak up on your enemies and take them down with a stealth kill. Unlike previous games you aren't gaining stealth kills to lead to an inevitable gun fight. Here you can actually play through entire sections without ever firing off a shot if you want to. There are even moments where you can sneak by enemies without killing them at all. The system works because it allows for more flexibility. When I mention it takes inspiration from Metal Gear Solid and other stealth games its not an exaggeration. You can sneak around and enemies all have a gauge that fills up when you're in their line of sight. When it's full their icon turns yellow and they'll actually take notice and you've only got a limited amount of time to get out of sight. Once their icon changes to orange, however, they'll engage in combat. And yes, you can find a place to hide and they'll disengage. While they'll still be combing the area looking for you, you'll be comfortably back in stealth mode.

The only downside to Uncharted 4's stealth mode is that you feel like more could've been done with it. Stealth, especially in areas where you need to kill everyone, takes a long time and asks a lot of patience, but you can't utilize a ton of strategies, because you simply don't have a ton of options for dispatching enemies. When enemies notice you for example, they just keep looking in your direction for a while, but they don't actually come to investigate. You can't effectively lure as a strategy. While they'll go and inspect downed bodies you'll be disappointed to know that afterwards all they do is tell people you might be around but then they just go about business as usual. After playing through Metal Gear Solid V, Uncharted 4's stealth segments feel under utilized and not developed enough. Granted, Uncharted 4 isn't a stealth game. It's a shooter and as such the game seems to be pushing you to engage in gun fights more so than sneak around. After all, the only means of dispatching enemies is to sneak up on them. The only other way is to shoot them and if you do that you'll expose your position. On the other hand, though, trying to see if you can eliminate all of the enemies in an area without being seen is actually a lot more fun than I make it sound. The stealth elements might be generic, but in an action shooter like Uncharted 4 you're not really likely to mind all that much. And if the worst should happen the game is constantly saving progress.

If you die in Uncharted 4 your progress is never sat back that far and if you constantly fail the game will ease up a little thanks to its implementation of dynamic difficulty. If you're constantly failing the game might ease up by lowering the accuracy of your enemies or making them toss grenades less. To ease your mind, however, the dynamic difficulty is actually impacted by the difficulty setting you choose. For instance, if you're playing on the highest difficulty setting you'd have to fail A LOT for the dynamic difficulty to adjust where as on the easiest difficulty it kicks in a lot sooner. The dynamic difficulty also only kicks in for the encounter you're currently engaged in. Once the encounter is over everything resets and the next encounter your adversaries will be just as accurate as they were before.

Like previous games, Uncharted 4 also has a lot of set piece moments filled with action. Some of them are really exciting and heart pounding such as the often shown city rampage present in so many trailers and demos of the game. These are, indeed, exciting moments. It's a shame, however, that Uncharted 4 doesn't actually have moments nearly as big in scope or as memorable as Uncharted 2's train sequence (or helicopter rooftop chase) or nothing as glorious as Uncharted 3's capsizing ocean liner that you had to escape. Most of its set piece moments don't last as long. This doesn't mean Uncharted 4 doesn't have incredible or engaging moments. It absolutely does. It's just that while Uncharted 2 and 3 sprinkled their best moments throughout the adventure, Uncharted 4 wants to save them all for the endgame and this makes up for some of the less memorable moments before hand. Uncharted 4 saves its best and most emotional moments for last making the entire journey worth it in the end. If there's one thing Uncharted has never been very good at, it's their final encounters. The final fight of Uncharted 2 comes to mind. Here, everything in the end game is consistently engaging both gameplay wise, narrative wise and emotionally. If the set piece moments sprinkled throughout fall short of Uncharted 2 and 3 it's all forgiven by the time you hit the last stretch of the game where it hits emotional and narrative heights that Uncharted has never reached before. It's not always as consistently ""exciting"" getting there but the payoff and emotional investment is far greater than any Uncharted game before it.

All of this praise may make it seem like Uncharted 4 is nothing short of a masterpiece. And from a narrative perspective that's entirely true. Except Uncharted 4 has a few nitpicky things with gameplay that sometimes hamper the experience. Let us take those open sections where you can roam around (usually in a vehicle of some sort). Uncharted has always been a fairly linear experience where the game's have worked to keep the story going by funneling you to certain places. Uncharted 4 does this too... except for in moments where it wants to be a big open world. During these moments the game almost seems to stop. There's a lot to explore, it's just not worth exploring in these moments. There might be optional treasures to find, but none of these optional treasures are necessary to pushing the narrative forward. Previous games made sure the optional treasures weren't too far off the beaten path, but Uncharted 4's open world sections are begging you to tread a LONG way off the beaten path without getting your bearings. Again, none of this stuff is necessarily bad, it just feels unnecessary to make such huge open areas that are primarily empty without a lot of narrative function in a game that pushes narrative as strongly as Uncharted does. At the very least, though, if you do get lost there is an option to have the game show you exactly where to go. I don't actually recommend the option. Even though the areas feel overdeveloped and empty, I still found myself glad to have an open area in an Uncharted game to explore. I just with the exploration had been more worthwhile.

There are also moments where the game feels like a test of trial and error. Uncharted 4 has platforming sections where you scale walls and cliffs and where you'll jump to various planes. But other times it puts you in moments where you might have to fail just to figure out where it was you were supposed to be going in the first place because the game doesn't always make it clear where you can go. When this happens in platforming it isn't nearly as bad. When it happens during a set piece moment, however, where the game only has forward momentum, you might not always be able to see what the game is asking you to do before you fail. There's a particular underwater section where this was an enormous problem. Other Uncharted games also had trial and error moments, but they were not quite as pervasive as they are here. Luckily the punishment for death isn't harsh in Uncharted 4 and it didn't stop me from enjoying its moments.

Despite these nitpicky complaints, though, Uncharted 4 was a great experience from start to finish. It's a little slow to start and takes a while to pick up, but the closer the story comes to its conclusion the more engaging and investing it actually became. Like The Last of Us, Uncharted 4 asks you to be patient while it puts everything into place and develops its characters, situations to earn your trust. It might seem different than how the first three Uncharted games worked, but the payoff is far greater than the previous three games. By the time the credits in Uncharted 4 rolled, the only thing I could think about was how badly I wanted to see this story unfold a second time. It's memorable. It doesn't have nearly as many exciting moments getting to its conclusion as Uncharted 2 or 3 had, but it certainly provides a better payoff with what it gives you. While Uncharted 2 and 3 relied on spikes in action and then deescalation before slowly building up to the next big moment, Uncharted 4 opts to spend the entire game building upon each moment, making each revelation better than the last. It makes for a game that is much more slowly paced than the previous ones, but it provides the best moment of catharsis the series has ever seen as a result. It's a different approach to Uncharted, but it definitely works. If we really do have to say goodbye to Nathan Drake, this is certainly the best send off we could've hoped for.",A Fantastic Close to One of Gaming's Best Adventure Series,1464393600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

When you pick a class (I played a mage as I normally do), you are started off in a class-appropriate area and shown the ropes before being recruited for a huge battle. Every class has a different starting point so if you play through again, you'll have a different opening sequence to experience before being recruited.

The interactions you have with other characters, even the ones in your group, are extremely well-written. The amount of choices you can make that affect the outcomes of the lives of your teammates is staggering. Heck, I even killed a character who would have joined my group, eliminating him from the game forever in the process. You don't feel like you're being guided towards any conclusion or other, you feel like you have the power to control what happens. I had one character in my group leave the group and stand in our way because she didn't agree with the choice I had made to go into the next room and kill the demon inside. She had to die and I had to recruit another healer. The game doesn't feel like it gets in the way of what you want to do, it just presents choices and gives all the power of what happens to you.

Combat? Combat is tactical but easy enough. You can give your teammates tactics to follow so they automatically know how to respond in certain situations. Building a cohesive team while remaining a hero in your own right is essential to getting through this game. The boss fights are great, too, even if they aren't all that complicated most of the time. You can perform combinations to great effect in this game and your positioning relative to the battle is also very important. Once you learn the basics, you start to automatically get a feel for some of the more advanced stuff that comes later on.

Again, though, what sets this game apart from any of the challengers is the writing, voice acting, and overall story are extremely compelling. This isn't a game you can finish in 5 or 6 hours, either. It took me closer to 40 to get through everything, although I took on every side quest I could find.

Add to this the fact that you are given ALL of the DLC for the game on one disc and the expansion on another disc, which also has an interesting story.

The graphics are washed out on the consoles and don't look anywhere near as good as the PC version but that shouldn't deter you. If this game gets to you, you won't care. You'll still be amazed at all you have to uncover, how difficult some of the choices you have to make are, and the consequences of those choices ARE realized later in the game.

My sister's friend had gotten it for christmas and was telling us all about it. ""Wait, you mean you can build houses with fences instead of real walls, your people can pee on the floor!"" I just couldn't wait to buy it and torture my very own families. And I did, but I also grew very attached to some of them. I grieved with them when poor Ken was killed in a microwave related fire, I celebrated with them when the once lesbian Mia settled down with Jason and had a baby.

  Now about 4 years later the Sims are back and much more sophisticated. Here's a quick overview:

Aging: Finally your kids can become teens. Toddlers are like way cute, and making a grandma to keep the house clean and cook all the meals for the busy family is nice too.

Make a sim: Wow, this is the best thing by far. You can change every detail of their face, from width of their nose, eye color and their makeup. Awesome now its real easy to make an evil looking sim, or a redneck or even Miss Simville 2005. You could spend hours alone perfecting the family

Neighborhood: There are 2 types of home designers. The square house people, and the intricate model home designers. Oh how I longed to bulldoze my sister's horrible square homes, with no trees in the unfenced yard (shudder). Now with the Sims 2 you can build a quaint cottage, double wide trailer, Mansion on the lake etc. Although all pools are still just squares. Also you can choose what the neighborhhod view looks like. Want to make a dusty desert town? How about a sweet valley town? Name it, build it, add boats in the lake or hot air balloons in the sky, or even a crashed UFO. this game gives you way more options.

5.0,False,"04 5, 2012",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00008URUB,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess. And now that there's a DX version, it's on several other systems, including Gamecube, Xbox, PC, PS3, etc, so everyone gets an opportunity to see this classic.

The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character.

Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through.

Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying?

Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds.

Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer.

E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters.

Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........

That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks!

However, Sonic Adventure DX is not without flaws. There are a few times where the collision gets a little awry, and the cutscenes aren't amazing, too. While the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother. Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat. Nevertheless, these are, again, minor problems, as the game is so much fun that you'd hardly think about them. Oh yeah, and the unlockable collection of Game Gear games is a great bonus!",Sonic's major step into 3D gaming,1333584000,,,
5.0,False,"12 5, 2015",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00KWF366S,Tsanche,"Twenty years ago, Nintendo released Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island.  The game was a masterpiece and made Yoshi even more popular than he already was at that time.  Since then Yoshi has been in several games with varying aesthetics.  From the crayon inspired visuals of the first game, to the oil pastel inspired visuals of Yoshi's New Island.  Yoshi's Wooly World takes an aesthetic similar to Kirby's Epic Yarn.  This should not suggest, however, that the game is the same thing with Yoshi slapped on.  Yoshi's Wooly World is a delightful experience.

As is the case with many Nintendo games, Yoshi's Wooly World is not a story centered kind of game.  It is a game which wants to focus on gameplay more so than anything.  Kamek has come and turned several of the Yoshi clan into yarn and kidnapped them.  Along the way he drops a few bundles of yarn.  A few of the Yoshis managed to escape and now have to follow Kamek to rescue their friends.

If you've played previous Yoshi games, then Yoshi's Wooly World is going to be easy to sink into.  As Yoshi you will traverse a series of levels over the course of several worlds.  Yoshi can use his tongue to ingest enemies and he can turn them into yarn balls, which he can use to throw.  Yoshi can also flutter and ground pound just as he always has.  But the most important thing is making yarn balls and using them.  You'll have to constantly throw them at enemies, use them to fill in platforms and sometimes even toss them at enemies so that you can use them.  For example, throwing a yarn ball at a chain chomp might turn them into a giant ball of yarn that you can use as a ball to push.  On the surface, Yoshi's Wooly World is simple.  And were it not for the level design you'd likely think it was an easy game.  Certainly it begins this way, but Yoshi's Wooly World can actually be challenging.

Unlike Kirby's Epic Yarn, Yoshi's Wooly World isn't a cakewalk.  While I still believe Kirby's Epic Yarn to be fun, there were never any consequences for anything for the player.  Some games have succeeded through this (the LEGO games are usually still great regardless) but it also meant that Kirby's Epic Yarn didn't really provide a lot for players to strive for.  Yoshi's Wooly World has consequences.  You have a finite number of hits to take before you fail and there are pitfalls everywhere.  The first few levels are simple, teaching you the basics of the game.  Once you've learned them you're off on your way and the levels become more unique.  While various concepts might be repeated, every level feels unique and different.

Throughout each level there are certain metrics that have to be met.  You need to collect five flowers, five bundles of yarn and 20 stamps.  This is very similar to what Yoshi games usually do in general.  You are also tasked with completing a level with all of your hearts.  It's the flowers and bundles of yarn that are most important.  The flowers open up hidden levels, while the bundles of yarn rescue a new Yoshi.  It's finding all of these goodies in the levels that can add to the challenge considerably.  For instance, to find all the flowers might require you to find hidden bubbles to pop or bonus rooms.  You need to be willing to search every nook and cranny to find every levels hidden secret.  The stamps are hidden among the gems you collect.  And collecting gems is important because you can buy powerups by using them.

The powerups can make the game easier if you so choose.  They have different properties.  One, for example, makes all your yarn balls big.  Another allows you to see all the hidden secrets in a level.  There are a lot more, but they're helpful.  Especially the ones that allow you to see the various hidden secrets.

For those who are curious about whether or not the game is a challenge, it is.  Once you get beyond the first world the game has no qualms throwing various environmental challenges at you that will test your reflexes and platforming skills.  If anyone finds the game a little too much you can change difficulty settings at any time.  There's a classic mode which sets the difficulty where you want it, and a mellow mode which considerably drops the difficulty level for those who just want a nice adventure through the game.  For those who are experienced platform players, I highly recommend the classic mode.

There's also a co-op mode.  Two players are able to go about the game together.  It's a unique experience.  But it's not like New Super Mario Bros.  The game doesn't move fast enough for a second player to be continuously left behind.  Players can also eat one another and utilize them.  This means if you're partner is about to fall into a pit you can definitely save them.  It's a good experience that isn't really hampered too much.  There is a lot of fun to be had, but you won't find yourself in constant competition with the one you're supposed to be working with.  This means it's not as crazy as New Super Mario Bros. is, but it also means that you're likely to get through the game more smoothly.

There are a lot of games that rely on raw power for their visuals.  But being a good looking game isn't just about graphical prowess.  It's also about your art direction and artistic design.  Yoshi's Wooly World is by far the prettiest looking game I've ever seen on the Wii U, and it's all due to the art design of the game itself.  Everything in this game is made of wool.  But the game keeps this aesthetic choice going throughout the entire experience.  Yoshi wool will stitch into something else depending on what he's doing.  When he's in water, for instance, his feet stitch into tiny propellers.  When you eat shy guys, they unravel when Yoshi turns them into balls of yarn.  This doesn't just happen with the characters, but with the environment as well.  Yoshi can pull at loose threads and watch parts of the environment drop away and change.  He can also push fabric aside to find hidden secrets.  Since everything is made of wool or looks stitched in some way it helps the game keep a consistent and uniform look.  It's an amazing looking game.  It's also insanely colorful and bright.  Yoshi has gone through several different artistic looks, but this wool like look is the most imaginative that the series has ever had.  If you have Amiibos you can also see how Yoshi looks as various different characters depending on the Amiibo you've used.

The music in previous Yoshi games hasn't been the best.  Yoshi's Island DS had music that was quite forgettable and just didn't match up with the tone of the levels at all.  Yoshi's New Island soundtrack was barely even worth talking about.  Yoshi's Wooly World actually has good music.  It's got a lot of catchy tunes.  Likewise, almost every level has its own unique background music.  There are also various sound effects that are familiar.  You've heard most of Yoshi's yelps and hums before and they're not really any different here.  A lot of the music, however, sounds calm.  It can be good considering that a lot of the levels in Yoshi's Wooly World are quite lengthy, even the early ones feel longer than your average platformer.

Yoshi's Wooly World is a delightful game.  There are not a lot of problems with the game in and of itself.  The problems it does have, however, are mostly problems that can be avoided or are more subjective.  For one, you can use a Yoshi Amiibo to have an extra Yoshi with you, and you'll control both.  This is not a good way to play.  It's more trouble than it's worth.  But in order to end up with this problem you'd have to actively do this in the first place.  And while the game can be a challenge due to platforming and hazards... the bosses are strangely not that difficult at all.  A lot of Yoshi games give you tons of creativity.  And while there are some creative bosses here, none of them are actually that difficult to defeat.  The trek to the bosses are more challenging than the bosses themselves.

There isn't a lot that keeps Wooly World from being amazing.  It's a great game that any fan of Yoshi should play.  It's creative and imaginative in a lot of ways.  For those who've gone on Yoshi's previous adventures, Wooly World is a delightful experience.",Stitched to Perfection,1449273600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'}",

Pros:
Level of activity--Unlike another reviewer who said couch potatoes will love some of these games, I've found they all get you moving to some degree.  Sure you can sit to do some of them if you want to but that was true of Wii Sports also.  They're as active as you want to make them.  You'll feel the effort on all--even the water sports where you're using just your arms.  Your arms and upper body will feel it!

Variety of games--There is something for everyone.  You'll have favorites (mine are Wakeboarding, Table Tennis and Swordplay) and others that you don't love as much (I'm as bad at Basketball as I am in real life and I'm lukewarm on Power Cruising) but there are games that will appeal to everyone in the household based on age, ability and likes.  I won't list them all because other reviewers have.

Wii Motion Plus--I have to say that for some games I don't feel the nuances.  For others, however, I definitely feel the difference.  In Bowling, the ball response to what you're doing with your hand and wrist is much more realistic.  It makes the game even better although more challenging and adds a new dimension.

Fun even by yourself--There are more games that are fun to play by yourself than in Wii Sports because of the nature of the games.  Like Wii Sports, it tracks your level/status as you work towards Pro, etc.

Cons:
No online play--It would have been great to be able to compete online and have tournaments and rankings like in MarioKart.

Additional Wii Motion Plus needed--You will want a WM+ for every player's remote.  The good news is that some of the games allow remote sharing so this is only necessary if you want to do competitive play on certain games.

Lack of depth--As mentioned by others, I wish some of the games had even more options or depth.

Overall:
Wii Sports Resort is a great game to have!  If you like Wii Sports then this game will be one of the classics that you pull out regularly.

I do like to try out games in other genre, and Devil May Cry has certainly been the recipient of much critical (and enthusiast acclaim).  With the price being as attractive as it is I decided that this would be my semi-annual dip into the world of compulsive destruction.
The story is straightforward.  Girl drives into occult detective's office, stabs him with his own sword, then asks for his help in fighting the underworld.  It seems that a BIG evil is planning to take over the earth and has set up shop in a castle on Malay Island.  Dante, by the way, is the son of the demon knight who originally defeated this particular BIG evil.  So revenge is also on the menu.
What ensues is a mad dash through a gothic nightmare that augments normal castle architecture with jungles, ships, airplanes, outer space, and, of course, hell. [I guess the story wasn't so straightforward after all]  All of this is an excuse for some of the most detailed graphics that I have ever seen.
The animation is of such high quality that you can't always tell where a cut scene ends and the action starts again.  And, lest I forget, an array of weapons, gadgets, and puzzles that kept me busy from start to finish.  Very little was spared in making this a spectacular playing experience.
My only complaints aren't about the game, but my own mediocre skills.  While I'm not exactly arthritic, my ability to deftly poke and stroke my controller is substandard.  And Devil May Cry is a game that requires both pinpoint accuracy and good timing.  Which means that the twelve hours of play that ended with me stumbling into the finale did nothing for my self-esteem.

I love this console. It brings your living room together perfectly. The software has been improved so much, it runs smoothly and fast. First update took about 2 hours, but my internet is slow. Kinect works creepily well,hand gestures and voice commands, even in a pitch black room. Surprisingly works with my old DST, and even hunts down the HD versions of the channels! Titanfall is a great game that entertains me for ours on end. 100% reccomend

*What I like:*
[+] The dashboard is integrated WAY better than the Xbox 360 and PS3. There is no longer the feeling of ""in a game"" or ""in the dashboard"". You are ALWAYS in both. Say you are in the middle of a game but want to spontaneously change a system setting or launch another app etc. Both the 360 and PS3 had some semi-dashboard functionality built into the dashboard/home button, but most everything required you to first exit the game and go to the dashboard (aside from some shortcuts to go straight to a different game). Now, you press the dashboard button and without interrupting your game in any way, you now have access to the full dashboard and settings, etc. There is really no such thing as being required to ""quit"" a game anymore, which is awesome.

[+] Speed. I always was surprised that through the entire life of the Xbox 360 (including the 360 S and 360 E), there was an unacceptable amount of lag on many core dashboard functions. Something as basic as showing your list of games, or list of gamerpics to change to, or achievement lists, or loading marketplace screens, would often take several seconds of waiting to populate. The Xbox One's startup is acceptably fast, but basic things like loading marketplace content or my list of installed apps, achievements, etc, is very quick. Switching between game and dashboard is no longer the slow annoyance it used to be, but rather is nearly instantaneous.

[+] Dashboard Layout: The Xbox 360 dashboard was too cluttered and poorly organized, in my opinion. There were many different 'sections' to scroll through with LB and RB that made it take longer than necessary to get around. The Xbox One dashboard only has three now, it's much cleaner and simpler. Your pinned games/apps, main section to switch back to currently in-use game/app or browse your other apps, etc, and the third section is for browsing/downloading new games/apps. Very easy to navigate. It's also completely add free. Though at launch, the Xbox 360 had very few ads, and over time Microsoft worked a lot of extra advertising space into the design. So let's keep our fingers crossed that doesn't happen again, especially when you are a subscribing Xbox Live Gold member! I also like the notification and achievement changes. You can earn 0-point achievements in random apps, like for watching videos and such. It's admittedly pretty pointless, but if you don't like the idea of pointless achievements, you can easily ignore their existence.

[+] Built-in game DVR. Very cool feature that removes the need for external recording equipment for anyone interested in that. Even if you don't plan on using this feature, it could still benefit you in the form of more & better guide videos from other people that will likely be swarming onto YouTube.

[+] The controller. Controller design has come a long way since the old Atari joysticks or uncomfortable NES gamepads. I have used Sony's Dual Shock 3, Nintendo's Wii U Pro controller, Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller. They are all fantastic. But I must say I always liked the 360 controller the best. The Xbox One controller is simply an improvement upon that one. The only downside to the 360 controller was the mediocre D-pad, which has definitely experienced a massive improvement in the XBO update. They also moved the guide/dashboard button higher, which I like since I used to accidentally hit that when I meant to hit Start/Back. I even like how they redesigned the battery to go inside the controller. It takes slightly longer to swap a battery out, but since I use the USB cable to charge instead of swapping batteries (no Quick Charge Kit yet exists for the One like the 360 has), that doesn't matter at this point. The only thing I don't like is renaming the Start and Back buttons. ""Press Menu"" sounds way less cool than ""Press Start"" you're used to on any game's splash screen.

[+] Noise levels and cooling/reliability. Anyone who had a launch Xbox 360 or launch PlayStation 3 knows what I'm talking about. Those things were LOUD. Distractingly loud. The Xbox One's internal fan is very large compared to the launch 360 (google photos if its internals). Large fans can move more air and are not as loud as small fans. This also helps with its reliability, as the Xbox 360's biggest launch issues were overheating problems. Microsoft learned from this and I guarantee that will not be an issue here. I wanted to make sure of this, so I have literally had my Xbox One powered on almost 24 hours a day for the last week since launch day. This is because if it's going to overheat, I want to know now rather than down the line after the warranty is up. And I'm killing two birds with one stone because Killer Instinct has some goals related to how long you are in practice mode, so I leave it idling in practice mode while at work. Yeah, call me crazy. But anyway, so far, it has handled being constantly on for days at a time with not a single issue.

[+] The HDMI-In is definitely a unique feature to the Xbox One that the other consoles can't touch. It's not for everyone; you might not care about it. But it certainly opens up some neat possibilities. Any other HDMI-enabled device you may be interested in using can be switched to and from at a moment's notice. I plugged my Wii U into mine. I could certainly live without the HDMI input, but since it's there I may as well experiment with some interesting ways to use it.

[+] I obviously can't speak for everyone else, but my Xbox One console, disc drive, and controller, all function flawlessly and had absolutely no issues.","Great Console, Good Game",1414972800,4,,

Lleras,"Having played Dead Space 1 (DS1) I was looking forward to Dead Space 2(DS2), i was disappointed when the game was delayed beyond a Halloween release but the wait was so worth it. I played DS1 multiple times though just for the fun of it, true at times it got a little repetitive but it was still a fun game. DS2 improved on DS1 by adding new enemies plus the fact that you can use your enemies limbs as a weapon with kenisis it a welcomed addition. DS2 also improves on the DS1 storyline, it ads more characters and it ads more body than the simple get me out of here premise of the game. The mechanics of the game are pretty simple and easy to understand, mastering is a different story it takes practice and believe me through the game you will get plenty of it. The new weapons of the game are kind of gimmicky however, some are pretty fun personally I enjoyed the javelin gun, however my first round through I played using only the plasma cutter, why? Because even though there is no one gun achievement I was up for the challenge, besides it does make the game easier if you have just one weapon upgrade path to worry about and ammo drops are 90% for what you need instead of having to distribute your inventory slots and item drops between multiple weapons. Im playing through zealot right now and decided to try the other weapons and like I said some are fun but others are pointless, find the ones you like and stick with them. Dont play this like you would play a regular shooter, you cant force yourself through situations if you try that you are going to die 20 times in one checkpoint and find the game more frustrating than what it really is. If you are a run and gun type of person keep looking however if you like to strategise and be challenged by your enemies this game is for you.

Henry Hatsworth is an old adventurer on a quest to find a magical golden suit (imagine Indiana Jones as an old man).  Competing against Henry is another adventurer who collects things just to get rich.

In the side scrolling world, Henry has to kill various creatures with his sword or his ray gun.  Enemies float down into the puzzle world, where they must be killed again by matching up different colors.  In the puzzle world, you can also match up blocks to increase your health or send a lightning bolt to the side scrolling world.

The game is fast paced and involves quick switching between worlds.  Players have to be quick in puzzle mode to kill off enemies before they return to the side scrolling world.

1) Tunguska - Probably the best of the bunch. Conspiracies and Russians and mysteries - oh my!

2) Deadreefs - You like pirates? ARRR, maties!

3) Return to Mysterious Island - Stranded on an Island. Now must explore and uncover its hidden secrets. In another word, your standard aventure game, but a good one.

4) NibiRu - You are Indiana Jones... Er, I meant, you are Martin Holan, sent on an adventure to uncover secrets of the Nazis and Mayans!

5) Keepsake - You are Harry Potter, but had a sex change. Now, you must solve the mysteries behind the disappreance of everyone inside the magic institution you are attending.

Really, you should give these a try. One thing though; these games are not patched! So, get your patches... 2 of the 5 anyways.

First off, I'm not into vampire stuff, but I did find this game a lot of fun to play.  I had seen some screen shots and didn't like them because of their messy look, but turns out the graphics is excellent and actually quite clean.  (Saw some kids play the PS2 version in store and I'm happy to report that the Xbox version has much better graphics and also smoother framerate.)
One thing that I really like about the game is the easy-to-master controls.  A lot of first-person adventure games [are bad] because playing them requires more skills than fighting an F-18.  But this game is easy to learn.  At the beginning Umah, a female busty vampire, trains you in the basic controls.  It's important to master them as you'll get quite busy later on.  The environment is large and well done.  Occasionally you do run into a camera-angle problem (i.e., you can't really see what you are doing), but that's rare.
While Kain looks pretty ugly -- this is my first LoK game -- I have to admit that I actually liked him a lot by the time I finished the trainings.  Which, of course, made me enjoy the game more. :)

5.0,True,"03 17, 2015",A26TP13CTQX8ZT,B00KQYEJE8,LivinOnEdge,"***UPDATE 03/19/2015***
Still having a great time in multiplayer, everything feels so smooth except for driving. To me, driving just feels clunky, sport cars certainly have an awful turning radius. Flying helicopters is a blast. I found that if you can't gun an enemy down on a fly by, smash him with a quick landing! I find it more fun to try and smash enemies than to actually shoot them now.

I have rarely any connection issues. I have on occasion, been kicked from the game during a new map cycle. But I have been able to play full games with zero lag and no drop in connection.

The spawning is still as bad as it's always been. Even when I am not spawning on a teammate in action, I am spawned somewhere on a flag where a vehicle just ""HAPPENS"" to be driving in the neighborhood and runs me down.

The machine gun on the helicopters vs the machine gun mounted on and armored car baffles me. The armored car's mounted gun is far superior than that of support and attack helicopters, and I'm not even talking about upgrades here. I have used both, stock, and I can far more easily take down a group of Charlies than I can with the weak guns on the choppers.

The stingers seems to lock on way to quickly, or there is a delayed cockpit warning that you are being locked on. I swear it feels like as soon as a stinger even readies, its already being fired.

Anyways, I have yet to go through campaign yet and will be continuing to update this as I go. So far for the multiplayer....LOVE IT!

***RELEASE DAY 03/17/2015 FIRST ENTRY***

This will be a review that I will continue to update as time goes on but here's what I have to say about it.

Battlefield Hardline in itself is very fun and very involving. Speaking from a multiplayer standpoint, what you do will effect the whole team. If you get lazy and don't play the objective in games like ""Hotwire"" and ""Heist,"" your team will be very upset at you and as a whole, are bound for failure. BFHL offers unique objective game types that parallel the more common game types with a twist that essentially make them a whole new genre.

(Example) Hotwire is essentially a capture the flag game type. The twist, the flag is completely mobile and must remain so, there is no capture point, and your flag can be used as a weapon or it can be a death cage on wheels for you and your teammates.

On another note, I would classify this game as an expansion to the series. I feel like its a breathe of fresh air as it offers more urbanized warfare and not vast amount of desserts like previous battlefield titles, giving a bit of rest until the next Battlefield game is released. It also brings the feeling of chaos closer to home as the terrain is more familiar and the modern trends of our industrialization brings a blissful joy.

I have yet to completely dig deep into this game as it has just been released, but I will continue to update as I go along.",A great edition to the Battlefield series,1426550400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"08 15, 2014",A3KZDS16VTCBCD,B009CLBY0I,Alex K,"It had been years since I've played a Dynasty Warriors title. My last was Dynasty Warriors 3 for the PS2.

The core of this game is basically the same as its always been. You run your character through a huge battlefield, killing enemy soldiers and generals and completing objectives. The combat is a little repetitive, yes, but this IS a hack n slash so that's to be expected. It's so satisfying killing huge numbers of troops in a single swing which makes this game an excellent stress reliever. And with all the character unlocks and weapon unlocks you're sure to be engaged in playing again and again.

The story mode is actually pretty decent. The storyline revolves around you going back in time, because in present day you've lost a war to the ""hydra"". You need to go back in time to recruit allies to change the timeline. Cut scenes aren't bad - only con is all voice acting is Japanese only with English subtitles. But I actually prefer this to prior games where they did do English voiceacting...as the English voiceacting came off as incredibly cheesy.

There are so many characters to unlock and choose from. They all use tons of different types of weapons with their own pros and cons. Some are better at single target, some are better are crowds, some have better special attacks, ect. My personal favorite is Taishi Chi - I love his duel wielded clubs. But you can bring 3 characters into battle and swap as you see fit.

There's even a duel mode where you can fight one on one. Also internet modes are offered for standard modes...but with such a low number of players on the Wii U you'll be lucky if you can ever find a game online unless you have friends who play.

There's a weapon system to let you buy/craft weapons. Also there's a system to build relationships between your characters which gives you some special abilities in battle.

Graphics are pretty good. Not amazing or jaw dropping, but satisfactory. The game looks about average as far as the Wii U goes.

As far as cons about the game - the one main flaw this title suffers from on screen limitations that have haunted all Dynasty Warriors games. You'll frequently see troops dissapear and reappear around you as every console has limits on how many troops can be on the screen at any one time. It's not a big deal once you get used to it though.

The other con as I've already mentioned is the lack of english voiceovers. Everything is in subtitles. This can be annoying when you are given objectives during battle that pop up in subtitle form...you have to read the subtitles which is hard to do while you're focused on killing things. This isn't a huge problem, but annoying nonetheless.

And the music is basically the same as previous games, many tracks are recycled. But somehow, the Japanese rock/techo music fits.

Overall, I can't recommend this title enough, especially for the low price. Unless you hate hack n slash titles I highly recommend this.","Addicting, Stress Relieving Hack N' Slash!",1408060800,5,,

In my opinion, this is right up there with The Orange Box in terms of quality and value. You're getting 30 games, most of them good-great, for $29.99. That's a wonderful deal.

This collection has games from the '80's to the latter years of the first decade of the 2000's. Some older games, presented in their native format, do have borders, while newer games do not. This is done to preserve the image quality of these older games that weren't made to have their images stretched for widescreen 16:9 televisions. That said, most of them received significant upgrades to their image quality in the form of a resolution bump.

While I've yet to play all of the games in the collection, I've checked out Conker's Bad Fur Day, Killer Instinct Gold, Blast Corps and Jet Force Gemini. These games alone are worth the price of admission, but you also get 26 more games, in addition to extras in the form of videos about Rare's history, options to add filters and whatnot to classic games, etc.

The whole package exudes a quality you'd expect from Rare. That said, there are some minor quirks here and there, but nothing that takes away from this great package. Jet Force Gemini's controls, for example, are incredibly dated; however, Rare/Microsoft have said that they're going to patch in a dual stick control scheme to make it feel more current, which is a very good thing. The other 3 games, however -- Conker especially -- feel great and look better than the original versions running on their native hardware.

If you like Rare, love Rare, or you're new to them, this is a collection that won't disappoint you. No matter what kind of games you're into, I'm sure you'll find something here to please you. Rare is a company known mostly for their mascots such as Banjo-Kazooie, Conker, Joanna Dark, etc., but they also had wonderful games like Blast Corps and Jet Force Gemini that were really special and different for their time. Even though the graphics on the older games have aged, they look better than ever here, and a lot of these games are timeless.

The wii has been able to involve workouts in a fun and comprehensive way that has made it much cheaper, fun and enticing than going to a gym.  If you were a little overweight and ashamed of going to the gym, or had a lack of time/ money to make it to the gym this is for you.

Controls

Wii balance board and remote.  The balance board is the best device i have ever seen constructed.  It works on carpets and on hardwood floors.  The board weighs you every day and is able to determine how much preasure you are placing from one foot to the other or how your balance is distributed.  While doing the exercises it shows you where your ideal balance should be placed and helps you align your body properly to get the most of your workout.  The wii remote is used for some tasks like running or jogging.  While in your pocket or in your hand it can determine how fast you are moving just by it being on you. 5/5

Graphics

The graphics are typical wii 3d graphics.  Nothing above the ordinary but what you should be expecting.  If you go for a jog and take an island lap you see a very pretty island with the water along your side.  Its enough scenery to keep you running because you want to see it all.  The side games like balance and skiing look pretty good. 4/5

Gameplay

You get Aerobics, Strength, yoga, fitness, and minigames all in one.  Personally they are all fun to do.  Aerobics and strength are my favorites.  If you want a break you can cool off with some yoga and or minigames to work on your balance.
-Aerobics you can do jogs walk up and down on the balance board and do some boxing along with other things.
-Strength you can do crunches, pushups, twists and so on.  These are the workouts people dread but they are executed flawlessly and actually add fun to the game.  As you start out you might have a task to do 10 crunches.  As you do this and complete this task a few times then a new version of 20 crunches will appear. And it will go up further and further untill you get to a challenge mode which lets you go 1 on 1 with your trainer to see who can do more of the task before quitting.  This is the real challenger right here.
-Yoga you get simlar yoga poses like the half crescent, or the tree.  You are required to keep your balance while preforming these poses and giving deep inhales and exhales.  The board measures even the slightest movement in your balance and encourages you to do better and better every time.  This is more relaxing and can be used pretty well inbetween things like running and crunches to give your body some cool off time.
-Games are there to help you learn how to balance and align your body properly for other various activites in wii fit.  Some tasks might require you to balance on the board to move marbles around.  Or even move a character around an obstacle maze with the balance on the board.  The games add some fun and excitement to the game and are a nice breakaway from working out.

5/5 for gameplay.

All and all the wii fit is a recommendation for everyone.  Adults and kids alike will have fun enjoy themselves and keep in shape.  You are given a personal trainer that guides you through your workouts.  At the beginning you get a body test that measures your weight and determines what your body mass is.  Then you are allowed to determine what you want to accomplish with your weight, within a certain time line.  You can set goals for yourself that include loosing poundage, gaining pounds or staying in the same weight class.  You can then check in on your goals every day and see how your overall weight control has been going on a daily basis.  On a side note there is a clock that measures how much time you have invested each day.  When the clock hits 30 minutes you have reached your daily goal and it will tell you.  On a side note the game is designed to warn you when you have worked out for an hour time.  Once you hit the 1 hour mark it gives you a notice that asks you to take a 10-15 minute break and drink some water.  This is a great tool and encourages people to not overdo it.",Wii = Fun,1256860800,,,

Be careful this game is very punishing to new players, you get opp'd against people of all threat levels (Trainee, green, bronze, silver, and gold) The devs have stated in the past they do this to determine how good a player you are.

The tutorial Introducing you too this game is nearly non-existant and near worthless, alot of people think this game is FILLED with hackers, being as that is what helped nail the coffin shut for RTW, and they do exist in the game but being outplayed is more common than hackers are, and being outplayed leads to ""hackusations"" by alot of the playerbase. In my 600+hrs of gameplay i have seen a total of 5 hackers, and they were so obvious that shortly after i opp'd them they dissappeared from the server never to return lol.

Please give the game a fair shake before runnin away in rage, this is not your average TPS, elite call of duty players walk into APB ready to destroy, and get spanked like a noob, don't expect to come here and pwn everyone, come in and expect to have fun and you will, don't have a win all mindset and you will have alot of fun.

The ability to make your player unique is what makes this game alot of fun too, you aren't some player standing next to 3 other mirrors of you, like other games. The range of distinction is awesome, and some stay around just for that and making tons of APB$ selling there awesome outfits.

Dont let others tell you that Pay2win exists in this game because it doesnt, the stock star 556 you get when you start, is used by a ton of the top players still, the star and great tactics, can own any other gun paid or not in the game.

5.0,False,"07 1, 2006",A2PZRYV6WAEOYT,B000A0EFJW,Ryan J,"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is the third game in the Ghost Recon series. Each of the games has improved over the original, and this one is no different. With new gameplay mechanics like the Cross-Com, a much improved cover system, and breathtaking graphics, Advanced Warfighter is a worthy sequel and a true next generation game.

The story takes place in modern day Mexico City. In the game you play as a man by the name of Scott Mitchell who is the captain of an elite light infantry unit called the Ghosts. You are there to provide security during a meeting between the leaders of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is during this time that some Mexican insurgents decide to attack the meeting in an attempt to come to power. They kill the Canadian prime minister and the US and Mexican presidents disappear. Your job, among other things, is to locate and rescue the US and Mexican presidents.

You won't be fighting alone for most of the campaign. You will have three teammates which you can order around for the majority of the missions. You can order them to attack, fall back to you, and move into certain positions. While the way you command them is not exactly deep or provides a lot of control, you can still be pretty effective with your squad. Your Cross-Com allows you to see what one of your teammates sees, allowing you to get multiple perspectives of the battlefield. Unfortunately, the squad AI can give you a bit of a headache sometimes. While they are usually pretty good at shooting enemies, it's not too uncommon to find your teammates exposing themselves too much instead of properly using cover. For the most part they do try to use cover whenever possible though.

Besides your three teammates, some missions give you other assets to control. One of which is a UAV which you can order around the level. The UAV can detect enemy troops and mark them on your HUD. Since you can die pretty fast in this game, knowing where the enemies are and planning your next move is essential, and having a working UAV helps greatly. Occasionally you will also have a tank or helicopter gunship. The tank can not only be used to attack enemies but it can also be used as cover while it moves. The helicopter is also pretty good and moving and striking targets on the ground quickly. During a few sequences in the game, you will actually get to fly around in the helicopter and use the machine gun on the side to take out huge groups of enemies. While these sequences are not too challenging, they are a lot of fun.

Because a single good shot can kill you in Advanced Warfighter, the game has a slower pace and more tactical feel then other action games. That is not to say that the game is dull; it is filled with fierce fire fights and big explosions, but it does require more thinking then some other games. You always want to lean around corners before going walking out in the open, and always fight from behind cover. Since the levels are pretty large (many city blocks for each level), there are usually multiple ways to get to each objective. Most of the time just taking a different route will end up in a totally different experience. Enemies roam the map, also making sure the game never plays exactly the same way twice.

The amazing graphics are probably the first thing you will notice when you load up this game. The amount of detail in objects and the size of the city are staggering. During the game's many helicopter rides, the city buildings and streets stretch out for mines in every direction. Sometimes you can see areas filled with fire or smoke from all of the fighting that has been going on. These sequences do a great job of making you feel that you are in a real city fighting in a real conflict. Mexico City just looks absolutely beautiful. Advanced Warfighter is easily the best looking game on the Xbox 360 console. The HDR lighting is used to great effect in all of the games missions, which range from early morning, afternoon, and dusk. During some of the afternoon missions, the sunlight can get so bright that it actually makes it hard to see. The character models are some of the best that I have seen. They are all extremely detailed and look very realistic. They also animate in a very believable way. The only negative thing you can say about the graphics is that things will sometimes ""pop"" into view when leaning around the corners. This does not happen often, but can take you out of the game for a moment when it does happen.

The audio in the game is also great. All of the guns sound different and extremely clear. Explosions and tank and rocket fire sound great as well. The game also muffles the sound when explosions go off around you. The music in the game is also pretty good and comes in at the right moments. The voice acting, while not amazing, is convincing.

While the single player game is great, the multiplayer is what's going to keep people playing. The game features three ways to play multiplayer: local play, system link, and over Xbox live. There is a large selection of game types to choose from. First, there are the excellent co-op missions which are a blast to play with your friends. Then there are the more standard game types you are used to like capture the flag and deathmatch. Besides those default settings, the game allows you to customize your game to play the way you want to. The multiplayer experience is extremely addictive and plays very well. I definitely expect people to be hooked on this game for a very long time.

Overall, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a great game. Offering an intense single player campaign and multiplayer matches which will remain fun for hours at time, Advanced Warfighter is a great complete package and sets the bar pretty high for the inevitable sequel.",All it's cracked up to be,1151712000,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Rocksmith starts out easy and gets progressively more difficult.  It adapts to your ability.  It starts out with the basics such as how to hold your guitar and pick.  A complete novice like me, can easily learn the simplest tasks with ease.  Rocksmith has a bunch of lessons that teach you the fundamentals.  I'm at the level where I am still struggling with learning how to use frets and cords.  The game slows everything down for me, so that I can master the fundamentals in my own time.

The game can tell when you're playing correctly and when you're having trouble.  I have a tendency to get nervous when another person is watching me learn something, so the fact that this game is able to correct me without a real person watching me is a real plus.

Another plus to Rocksmith is that you can start ""playing"" songs right away.  When you first start out with a song, you only need to play one note.  This allows even novices to start playing real songs from the beginning.  If you play those first notes well, the game will up the difficulty.

Overall, I highly recommend Rocksmith for new guitar players.  It has been allowing me to learn guitar at my own pace, in a stress free environment.

The Bad: Still requires memorizing combos, online play requires a strong connection, no characters from MK4 and beyond

""Fatality!"", ""Finish Him!"", ""Flawless Victory!"", ""Get Over Here!"". These are just some famous quotes from the infamous Mortal Kombat that everyone knows and remembers. What everyone mainly remembers is the fast paced fighting that has been missed since 1995's Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. It's been over 15 years since we got a really good and classic feeling MK game, but it's finally here and back with all its bloody gore. Yes the game is still in 3D, but its in what fighting fans like to call ""2.5D"". The game plays on a 2D playing feel and as soon as you start hammering away on those classic moves and combos you feel the nostalgia seeping into your blood.

The most surprising part about the game isn't the new level of gore, but the amazing story mode. Yes, Mortal Kombat actually has an awesome story mode that plays out far better than last generation's story modes. Instead of some ridiculous adventure mode or scrolling text we get a fully acted, scripted, and voiced story about the actual Mortal Kombat tournament and back story on almost every classic character. The voice acting is actually good and Netherealm Studios actually took the time to bring out each character's personality such as Johnny Cage's smart alack Hollywood attitude. Liu-Kang's eagerness, Kung Lao's jealousy, and Sonya's hotheadedness. The story is done beautifully despite picking up where Armageddon left off. Raiden travels in time to his past self to stop the destruction of armageddon. There are plot twists and even some seriously tense moments in the story that is quite gripping. I can actually say its the best story mode in any fighting game ever made.

However, fans came for the fight and this seriously delivers. Not only are the animations smooth and great to look at, but the controls are as tight as ever. The game responds without any delay and that's what a fighter is all about. Not only is the usual gore back, but the game just packs a serious punch and feels punchy. The hits transfer amazingly well into feelings and that's never been done in an MK game before. The newest things brought to the series are X-Ray moves. Fill you super meter up all the way and you can execute an extremely brutal move that shows your opponent in X-Ray vision and you can see bones crunch, snap, and organs burst. The anatomy is done superbly well with muscles, organs, and everything else in the right place. Each character has their own special skeletal structure so it stays true to the anatomy. I say bravo on Netherealm's part instead of doing it cheaply.

This super meter actually does one other things that I love and these are enhanced moves. Forget the crap from DC Universe completely. When you fill one section of the meter up (it fills up faster when you are getting your butt whooped) you can do the special move while holding down the ""Attack Modifier"" and it'll change the super move up a little bit and make it more powerful. For example: Doing Jax's Gotcha Grab will only do two hits, but if you enhance it he'll punch them five or six times and do more damage. Do Scorpion's Spear Throw and he'll throw two out for extra damage. These are great and each special attack has its own unique enhancement. This is great for strategists who want to give their fight a little extra kick. The second things you can do with the meter is the usual Breakers, but this requires two pieces to be filled.

For the first time Tag Teaming was put into the game and it works just as great as you'd think. Each character has a special tag out move and it makes the game more intense and just that much more fun. Of course the single player story mode will have you fighting against two people for a challenge, but when you play online or with a friend its an absolute blast. Of course this could have gone all wrong but the team learned from games like Marvel vs Capcom to get it right. This is just one more feature the team got right but could have gone horribly wrong or made the game too unbalanced.

The Fatalities are gory and each character has two plus a Stage Fatality combo. Each character's Fatality can be viewed in the move list in the pause menu, but you have to unlock the second one in the Krypt (more on that later). One thing I have to mention is that Babalities were brought back, but only certain characters can do these. These haven't been since since UMK3! When it comes to fighters there are no characters in here past UMK3. Classics only here and that's for the better. You won't see Kenshi, Kira, Drahmin, Hsu Hao or any of those guys, but there will be DLC add-ins later on so who knows. Each character is beautifully rendered and they fight just like you remember so fans can feel relieved about that. There is one new character and that is Cyber Sub-Zero to tie into the story mode, and he plays differently from the regular Sub-Zero and has some unique moves. Kratos is also an exclusive character for PS3 owners and he plays just like he does in the games complete with some quite time buttons and moves from God of War III. He even has his own unique stage with three different stage fatalities to choose from.

Mortal Kombat has always been known for adding a ton of content in since Deadly Alliance, but this time you're going to like the extras. The Krypt is back with just one type of kurrency this time around and the Krypt has five different sections. Each one has uniquely animated item containers and some are extremely gross, brutal, and gory. I won't spoil it but its very creative. My favorite extra is the Challenge Tower. There are hundreds of challenges that consist of fights that have different parameters such as zombies coming toward you and you have to use Johnny Cage's special Energy Ball move to kill them before they get to you. There's so many I would spend days explaining them but they are great fun and you earn kurrency doing them. One thing I wanted back so bad were the mini-games Test Your Might and Sight last seen in Deadly Alliance. They are back just as great as before, but two new ones were added. Test Your Strike is just like Might but you have to hold the meter inside a box for a few seconds before striking. Test Your Luck has you spinning a wheel and decides the fighter and fighting conditions for you.

Lastly Kombat Kodes were brought back last seen in UMK3, for people who don't know, each character gets three boxes during the loading screen and there are different codes such as headless combat, armless combat, dream combat, upside down combat, X-Rays disabled, blocking disabled, and it just goes on and on. These are used a lot in the challenge tower that I was talking about, but having them in VS is a blast. Lastly the online modes are a must have for any fighter these days and MK was the very first one and seems to be one of the best. While Tag Team and regular 1vs1 are expected a new King of the Hill mode lets you pick an avatar and puts everyone in a room that looks like a theater. The winner keeps fighting everyone in the room until he loses, but people can rate the fight based on a number score and can even cheer or boo the fight. This is a fun mode and is greatly welcomed.

My only big issue with the game is that the combos aren't as crazy as MK3 and you still have to memorize most of them and a lot of people don't like that. This still really isn't a button masher so strategic minds are still needed to fight well here. I really wanted to see more crazy combos that aren't complicated to pull off, but if you are hardcore enough you will find a way. Besides that there really isn't too much to complain about unless you want to gripe about characters from MK4 and on not being included.

Besides all this amazing content the game looks superb using the Unreal Engine 3 and every background is greatly animated, and they are all from classic MK games all the way back to the first one. The classic Stage Fatalities are also back but they are upgraded to pack more of a punch and are more gory. Overall the game looks and sounds amazing with lots of content to unlock and many modes to play. This is probably one of the best fighting games of this decade so far and definitely my pick for best fighting game of the year.

Kollector's Edition: For hardcore fans an extra $40 gets you two beautifully crafted book ends of Scorpion and Sub-Zero in gory Kombat, Ermac's classic outfit, a well put together art book, and PS3 themes and avatars. The big box is also nicely made if you want that too.

Tournament Edition: For an extra $90 you get a wonderfully created arcade stick but it does not come with any of the other stuff besides the extra outfit. It's up to you which one you get, but I preferred the Kollector's Edition since the stick can be bought separately elsewhere.","The best fighter of 2011, plus an epic return of a classic series",1332892800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Although, not a true console, it is a full-fledged gaming system, and that, I believe has always been Sony's intention.  That is to provide a all around gaming system to appeal to all types of gamers.

Okay, no, you won't see Grandma or your typical soccer mom toting one of these around, like a walkman, but I honestly don't think that was Sony's intent.  They were always intent on providing the hardcore gamer, such as myself, an outlet, to game on the go!

A little bit about myself. I was one one of those guys who actually bought the portable screen and battery for the PSOne.  Yes, that's right I carried my system on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) and played my favorite PSOne games on the go.  I'm also not your typical gamer.  I fall outside of the typical age range (I'm 40), however I am male.  And I'm a business man, not some college student with hours of time on my hands to kill.  In fact, I have fewer hours these days, due to another baby in my house.

That's what makes portable gaming so brilliant for me!  I can game when I want to, on my schedule, and on nobody else's!  And when I picked up the PSP, I picked it up, to enjoy all types of media.  And PSP offers it.  I was able to get my music and video watching in with my gaming.  I play very little games these days at home, but I use my PSP at least 1 - 2 hours per day, to and from work, and sometimes on breaks.  I can play virtually any game I have on my PS2, on the PSP, just slightly different versions.  And now I can watch movies on UMD.  And music.  A cinch, downloading from my personal CD's and other online music supply sources.

I even listen to Podcasts I download from my favorite radio stations.  No Ipod necessary here.  I got my ""I-PSP.""  Bangin'!!!!!!!

I'm honestly surprised to see everyone keep comparing UMD's to DVD's.  After all, how many times have you seen somebody toting around a portable DVD player on public transportation?  Not more than 5 times I bet.  I pay attention to that kind of thing, and I think I've seen about 5 or so, over the past 10 years.  And laptops are usually being used for computing, rarely watching of movies. But, with many major studios offering most of their movies on UMD, I have a solution.

Yes, I know UMD's are falling out of popularity, and Walmart might stop carring them in their retail stores all together, but Amazon carries the highest selection, much more than any other retail or online store I've seen. And so what.  Games will continue to be produced during the normal lifecycle of the PSP.

While it lacks some of the nostalgia factor (that spring twang and stiff trigger) I'd say it works better than the original. The smooth trigger lets me spam it for some real sharpshooting, making me feel like I'm in a western or something. With this design, one can shoot both ducks in a split second. I squeezed the trigger a bit hard as a stress test, and it holds quite well on its own. The plastic's a bit softer and thinner. Added on to the fact that it has less internal workings thanks to slightly more modern and less costly parts, it feels quite a bit lighter. But it doesn't really feel like it's just a cheap knockoff, in spite of it being exactly that. So, as long as you're not taking a hammer to it, it should hold up all right. They used a slightly modified mold, so it looks near identical to the original with the exception of the stock. It's just as comfortable to hold, too.

If you want to save a few bucks over a used original Zapper, then go for it. My expectations for this were pretty low considering the brand and price. I figured it was only 6 bucks and this thing greatly exceeded my expectations based on the reviews. I'm guessing that the worst case scenario is that you get one of the few defective ones and you'll have to exchange it.

And no, it doesn't work on flatscreen TVs. The way the games are designed to work make it impossible to use anything but a curved CRT.

I love the squid's eyes, the 'splatter' bases on each one, and the ink tanks on the back of the Inkling Boy/Girl. Fantastic designs. This three pack is also a slightly better deal per amiibo than usual, at $11.66 each rather than $12.99 each (if you get them at their $34.99 MSRP).

But what do they actually do?

In Splatoon, each of the three Inkling amiibo unlocks 20 challenges. These challenges are from the single-player story missions, and are different depending on which amiibo you use:

Inkling Boy:
His challenges are story missions where you are required to use a roller weapon rather than the standard splatter shot (a close range paint roller rather than normal assault rifle-like ink gun). These are probably the hardest of the three simply because certain parts of missions are difficult to do without a longer range weapon.

Inkling Girl:
His challenges are similar to Inkling Boy's where you do story missions, but using a long-range sniper-type of ink gun rather than the normal splatter shot medium-range ink gun. These are kind of fun since the normal story mode restricts you to one weapon, and the sniper can make certain parts of missions more interesting.

Inkling Squid:
The squid's challenges are definitely the most fun, in my opinion. They add a very welcome spin on the story missions, where you actually have a time limit to complete them. Instead of switching your weapons like the other two amiibo do, the squid will give you the Kraken powerup, which makes your ink swimming faster and more powerful. I had always thought while completing the story that extra goals/challenges/achievements would have been nice to give more of an incentive to replay the levels, and this timed challenge mode is one great way they did add replay value to the story.

Rewards:
The rewards for completing these challenges are actually very good. They range from 600 to 2000 of the in-game currency that is otherwise only obtainable through online multiplayer games, which typically get you 600-1000 per 3 minute game+2 minutes of waiting between games. So these challenges are definitely a faster way to get money, if you don't struggle too much to complete them quickly. Getting currency allows you to buy new weapons/headwear/shirts/shoes which change your player's abilities in online battle. There is a separate currency that you will also collect in the story missions and challenges that allow you to upgrade weapons/abilities in the single player missions only, and you will get some of that too while doing the amiibo challenges, but not as quickly.

In addition to Splatoon compatibility, these amiibo are compatible with certain games that give you daily rewards for scanning *any* amiibo, such as Mario Party 10 (daily scratch cards for coins), Hyrule Warriors (in-game items), and a few others. But Splatoon does not have daily rewards or anything similar, so only these three Splatoon amiibo are compatible in any way with Splatoon.

These are great aesthetically and I can definitely recommend them for fellow collectors, as well as for people who actually play Splatoon and would enjoy the extra challenges these unlock.",Great design & fun challenge unlocks in Splatoon!,1432944000,132,"{'Color:': ' Splatoon 3-pack', 'Edition:': ' USA'}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81liUMBUYHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KZkL0LXcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71USQUNje7L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816eSIc5XFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718W4k7uwnL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gt36qdxfL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+8YW8dUyL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mKsHu83nL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613E5O2yLQL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61epY6csjFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MqLHgJ0PL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JL02kBZQL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61BsKAZ0moL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MKKlilBoL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ieCPVCZ3L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71y6HHkAFEL._SY88.jpg']"

But when I saw this available on Amazon Vine, and had just started a Borderlands 2 campaign with 3 other people (I was planning on, and had used for one session already, my PS camera), it seemed like fate.

I've now used this in three 3 to 4 hour sessions and I'm completely sold. Unlike Warhawk's headset this one features a very nice external speaker. This means that instead of resting inside my ear a bit, it sits completely outside of it, resting against the ear. This is by far the best feature of this headset. Maybe others include this, but since it's new to me, it's an eye-opener.

The piece that wraps around the ear is also fixed, which I initially thought was going to be an issue, but actually works rather well.

The mute button is easy to trigger, and emits a pleasant tone when it's activated. I'm not sure what I think about the volume buttons yet, since touching them seems a little off, but it's not a big issue.

I also had to turn up the volume of the microphone on my PlayStation 3 itself as it was mentioned I was a little quiet. However, I'm generally that way in real-life, so that's probably me, and not a big deal since it only had to be set once.

The inclusion of different headsets is rather nice, but I haven't felt the need to change the one it already had on. Overall, I'm completely sold with my almost 4 weeks of use, and would definitely recommend the PlayStation 3 EX-02 Next Gen Bluetooth Headset to anyone that needs one for the PlayStation 3. 5 of 5 stars.",External speaker is key,1391299200,6,,

5.0,True,"09 27, 2009",A1RUWJ54AM3NEX,B001HWB68K,David Kearney,"First off let me say that Halo ODST is a great game if your a Halo fan. If your not a Halo fan then you'll be hard pressed to enjoy ODST because It uses the same engine that Halo 3 used. It also pretty much plays the same outside of a slightly shorter jump then Master Chief, no more dual-wielding as a ODST, and the HUD.

The single player campaign took me about the same time It took me to finish Halo 3 which is an amazing feat for what was previewed as a 2-4 hour campaign not too long ago. I was impressed with that feat because I was expected to be disappointed with the campaign length but I wasn't. The campaign had some nice pacing outside of when you first start you seem pretty lost (but that's the whole idea) not knowing what to do. Working in the dark with the visor was a refreshing take on this series, and being in the city in the middle of hell was something people complained about before, IE why were all the Halo battles AWAY from life? ODST throws you right in the middle of the mess and addresses that complaint.

The one thing that people may not enjoy with the campaign is the pacing. Basically since your alone you have to unravel clues to find your ODST squad mates, and in turn it ends up being a dark adventure with a way point telling you where to go (eventually). Some people may detest this but it was a great feeling for me being able to scourge for clues alone (tho you can co-op for your liking, 2 players locally and up to 4 on Live or System Link).

Firefight as you have read is great experience similar to horde in Gears of War 2. Basically wave after wave of enemies are pitted against you and you get so many lives to see how long you can last. It's a refreshing take again on Halo for those that want something different outside of the usual versus mode. I for one welcomed Firefight with open arms and It is definitely the high light of this package. My only complaint is there is no matchmaking for Firefight, so basically you have to manually invite your friends to play or add random people to your friends list to enjoy the mode further.

But you know who the real highlight of this game is?

The ODST? Nope.

Amazon.

Amazon came through on my order big time.
First I had this as my goldbox pick not too long ago, so I got $3 off for pre-ordering.
Then Amazon was offering a $10 credit towards future gaming purchases so I scored another $10 off.
The game also dropped to $51 so I got another $9 off the pre-order price gurantee.
The game got damaged in transit so Amazon offered me a partial refund for the shipping mishap.

Paying only $30ish for Halo ODST was a great deal, and only Amazon was able to provide me that experience.

If you like a good role-playing adventure, and love Bible trivia, then you'll appreciate this game.

You read the animated intro to the game. Parents are talking to their children about ""The Armor of God"", and keeping it safe by reading their Bibles. Then, the game begins...

You make your selection of which character you want to be (not too hard, as there is only a choice of two characters). After you have chosen your character, your clothes change (you look like someone right out of The Crusades)

The way this game is played, you move around building up on scrolls (these are very important! Press ""select"" to read the scroll, as it provides you with a Bible verse from either the Old or New Testaments. Always read your scrolls, you will see why later...)

You also collect crosses; these are helpful. You need these to convert into Holy Water. You do this by talking to townsfolk you see as you walk around the area.

There are 7 areas. Each area you travel contains one of the seven pieces of The Armor of God. To obtain a piece of the Armor, you need a ""key"". Each ""key"" is broken into pieces, and to get a piece, you need to locate and battle a ""Deciever"" (those devil-looking beings). Once you find him, you throw Holy Water at him, this stuns him for a moment. Then walk up to him.

You are asked a series of questions (this is why the scrolls are important to read!) After you answer the questions correctly, you will recieve a piece of the ""key"". Do this until you have completed a full ""key"". Then, the screen will scroll to where you need to be; find this location, and you will obtain one of the pieces of The Armor of God.

I like this game as it provides role-playing action/adventure, as well as test your knowledge of the Old and New Testement Bible. I strongly support and recommend this game.

It took me well over 20 hours to get through this on easy level. I took time out to shoot trees, barrels, and buildings. Also got lost a couple times and replayed two levels. The last 1/3 of the game isn't as fun as it gets too corridor based. In fact I only played through about 2/3rd's of the game and then started playing mods.

The best part of the game might just be the fan based mods. Some of these mods are as well done as the missions that shipped with the game. Mods are available at [...]. Two of the better mods are ICMC_Volcano and Ghadir. The Volcano mod has better sniper opportunities than any of the stock missions. While the Ghadir mod is based in a desert setting.

Sound: The voice acting is very good, the music is good but is kinda generic, as all the different variations sound basically the same. Gunfire and explosions are very realistic.

Weapons: They look awesome! You start with a Scar hybrid assault rifle and a pistol. You will get a FY71 from the first Korean you wax. The FY71 will become your standard firearm for at least 1/3 of the game. This is because you will have no way to get more ammo for the Scar. The FY71 does not have the best effective range. Probably 40 to 50 yards. At about 70 to 80 yards,it takes a entire clip+ to kill anything. Beyond 80 yards your just wasting rounds. This is a bit unrealistic but is done for game balance. Otherwise you would wipe out a whole squad of Koreans before they were ever aware of you. The Precision Rifle (Sniper Rifle) is a must have later on. You can take out anyone at distance but as soon as you fire, the whole camp knows your location. The scope on it gives you 4x or 10x magnification , and you have the classic figure 8 pattern so you have to time your shot. A nice touch! There is also a shotgun, sub-machine gun, Gauss rifle and mini gun.

Helicopters can only be brought down with missile launchers. It takes two hits to bring them down and the launcher only holds three rounds. So if you miss twice your screwed as you can't carry extra rounds for the launcher, you have to find a new one. Its best to save just before you encounter a helicopter.

Bugs: Not too many. I have the game patched to 2.1 on a 64 bit Vista OS machine. I had the game stop responding twice and had to reload a previous save. On one occasion a Korean froze upright and a couple of times I will see FY71 rifles in the air like someone is holding them, but no one is around. The AA guns in the mission in the harbor were invisible in my game. I found them by using my binoculars which shows there location and distance inside a diamond. Not too bad all in all for a PC game. The pluses of the PC format is there are plenty of fan made mods for this game.

Cons: Tank battles have so much potential in this game but there is only 1 mission that you get to control a tank. In this mission the enemy has so may RPG's that its usually necessary to get out on foot and clear the infantry RPG support first, otherwise your tank is a sitting duck. It would be nice to have a map with just tanks vs tanks.

The tanks get hung up to easily, a fallen palm tree or flimsy piece of sheet metal laying on the ground can bring them to a complete standstill.

Overall this game is just a blast to play. Even if you don't like the 2nd half you can get dozens more hours of game time playing mods.

On a 64 bit Vista machine with AMD 9550 quad CPU, GeForce 9500 GT 512MB GPU, 8GB RAM I was able to average 60 FPS at 1400x900 with all settings on high and no AA. This computer would be considered low to mid range priced by todays standards and the game plays great.

Being like most boys he picked a Mario title and a Sonic title. I jokingly commented to my husband I wanted to try Cooking Mama. The game is mine! Or so I thought when he brought it home for me a few days later.

I started playing right away and was quite amused by the cute little graphics, annoyingly catchy music and Mama's firey eyes when I messed up on my Fried Octopus Balls. The mini-game style and chances to practice each technique before making them kept me entertained to the point of taking the DS with me so I could play at random places outside my home. Until of course I laid it down one night (my thumbs were sore from hours of perfecting my Miso Soup) and my husband picked it up. Hearing him curse at the cheery little Mama and his over-cooked chicken was more amusing than watching him throwing his console controllers. Next my son got his hands on the game, it is HIS DS afterall. Soon it was his favorite, Mario and Sonic long forgotten.

I never thought this game would become a family favorite. I expected it to wind up lost somewhere in the stacks of other games.

Well, since New Super Mario Bros 2 is coming out for the 3DS later, I kinda figured I may as well go back and look at the title that started a series that harks back to the even-older days. I remember when I used to be really excited for this one. After seeing a picture of a supersized Mario running through a field of Koopas, I had to get it. However, it kept being delayed....And then when it finally came out, I got it, and I wasn't disappointed.

Those that have played the original Super Mario Bros series (as well as Super Mario World) know what to expect. Classic 2D Goomba-stomping block-breaking action throughout all-new levels. This is something we haven't seen since Super Mario World (Although there have been remakes and stuff), so it is pretty cool getting fresh 2D Super Mario action once again. What's also great is that the gameplay still remains to be good fun, and with all these new levels, as well as some other elements mixed in, it just makes it even better.

One downside is that while the minigames were a nice touch, but they were mostly recycled from Super Mario 64 DS. I guess it's okay for those that don't own Mario 64 DS, but those expecting new minigames will be disappointed.

However, 4-Player multiplayer makes the minigames fresh again! Meanwhile, you can also play with a friend in a Versus mode in while Mario and Luigi compete and find Stars around 5 levels. That is pretty fun, actually, especially when getting to use the power-ups to sabotage the other player.

The game is just flat out fun and its fast - yeah there are some issues with load time in installation and quirks online but this game rocks....firing nuke missles, scud storms are satisfying....controlling bombers, snipers, tanks make it seem like you're really controlling a battlefield and fighting a war....

there are other fantastic weapons to command like carpet bombing, spectre gunship straffing runs, artillery barages...its just fun as heck to unleash ""heck"" on your command...

there are superhero's to command to like general burton, jarmen kell, and black lotus...this game has it all and it is eerrily accurate portrayal of today's world military landscape, china, USA and Al Qaieda as the main forces at battle...

The GLA have suicide bombers, truck bombers and biological attack weapons that are crazy...don't believe the negative reviews on here cause this game is all that and a bag of chips...I wish they would come out with another expansion pack...the message board at EA is helpful too when learning strategies to play and watching highlights of the top players and how they manuever their forces...the game plays real time so the action is fast sometimes but enables strategy and planning in attack and defense formations....

For those of you seriously considering the upgrade, do it! The gist is the processing speed boost, better imaging, and slight shifts to the in-the-hand feel of the portable console is very much worth it if you're a dedicated Nintendo 3DS gamer.

If you are a new owner of Nintendo's first 3DS, congratulations! A massive world of gaming awaits you! For those of you new owners of the first 3DS, I would encourage you to wait if you have any hesitation and/or the $200+ upgrade cuts into your game budget.

Regarding the Majora's Mask edition, yes, this has been an extremely hard to find release (like the Monster Hunter edition I am told). For those of us lucky enough to have found one to add to our gaming library, and for fans of The Legend of Zelda franchise, this is really a special edition of the New 3DS. I understand the frustration of those who have not found a version as I, too, couldn't find one for months.

Pertaining to all the New 3DS', regardless of which particular edition you may own or be considering, they're fantastic! As shared above, the processing speed boost, better imaging, and slight shifts to the in-the-hand feel of the portable console is very much worth it if you're a dedicated Nintendo 3DS gamer. To add to that, now Nintendo has begun to release New 3DS specific titles, most notably, Xenoblade Chronicles adapted from the Wii iteration.

Have you also been frustrated with the headaches you get from the ""3D"" as issued on the original 3DS? Fear not! The New 3DS features a drastically improved 3D system with optical stabilization which simply means 3D now works and from more extreme viewing angles. I rarely if ever even turned on 3D on the original 3DS. Now, 3D is on nearly all the time. For example, the Majora's Mask game, from the intro sequence through the gameplay, is simply and stunningly gorgeous. The promise of the huge world of Xenoblade Chronicles could push the excitement for this New 3DS to great heights.

...and then there is Amiibo compatibility. I have yet to do much with the Amiibo figures at this point, but I have tested a few out. For collectors, I would imagine these also hard to find figures would be a worthy set of figurine series to chase down. I'll pick up a few favorite characters, for example Shulk, and append an additional review once I've played Xenoblade Chronicles for a few hours.","Majora's Mask Limited Edition or not, Nintendo's New 3DS is a fantastic upgrade for 3DS gamers!",1428537600,4,,

Pros:
Despite a few problems, this is probably the single best game in its genre.
Get ready to be sucked in for weeks of fun addicting gameplay, replayability on progressively harder difficulty settings.

Cons:
Stash inventory is far too small, when you have to make additional accounts to mule your excess gear, there's a problem.
Way too many useless magical items, needs a Tome of Alchemy which allows you to change one of your item's properties.

Then Europa Universalis is the game for you but be careful because you may never set it down.  Being a history buff, any game which allows me to conquer the world in the Age of Mercantilism is a dream come true so you can imagine how quickly I picked this one up.  Actually, I started playing the series with the first game and if you're new to the entire Europa Universalis line, I recommend you begin with the sequel which doesn't add an incredible amount of new content but is a better play than the first game.  Historically accurate rules and the ability to play any country from Spain to the Aztec Empire is what makes this game a classic.  War isn't as simple and one-dimensional as a classic turn-based strategy game such as Civilization or popular real-time strategy game such as Age of Empires.  While technically the game is real-time strategy (RTS), it really doesn't feel like it as it's a different approach from your typical RTS title. You can easily change the speed of the game by slowing down the progression of months and essentially turning the game into a turn-based strategy game which is the best and necessary way to play in most areas of the game. The game allows multiplayer and speaking of online communities, Europa Universalis may have one of the smartest PC gaming communities in existence. Check out the company's message boards for plenty of custom mods and in-depth history discussions.  While you're at it, make sure to download any patches as well because the entire Europa Universalis line has a notorious reputation for buggy releases.  This game takes plenty of time to master so don't expect to learn it in one day.  To enjoy this game, you really need to know what type of gamer you are.

Like the previous Driver games, there is storymode where you drive from one location to another. The missions are quite difficult which takes alot of practice. Some you might be repeating more than a couple of times (especially towards the end of the game). There is also a new feature that they added. Unlike the previous games, you can use weapons. This makes the game more realistic other than driving the whole time.

The graphics are just beautiful. It seems like you're really there and the explosions of the cars are just fun to watch. Another good thing is the music. And not just the game music, I mean your own music. The only problem is everytime you repeat a mission the music plays from the beginning again and again. It can get annoying.

It was so awesome looking & feeling that I had to get Luigi to match! Then Peach! And obviously at this point, I'm too far into it to not want to collect them all.

All of them are themed so perfectly, and this one is no different. They each have a primary color to match the respective character, as well as secondary and tertiary colors which all jive perfectly with the characters they represent.

Bowser's color scheme:
Mustard Yellow: Front, minus, plus, home buttons
Forest Green: Back, rubber sleeve, wrist strap, A button
Orange: D-Pad, B button, Bowser logo on front, wrist strap clamps
Black: 1&2 buttons

Sadly, Bowser is not available in the US. But fortunately, all these Wii Remotes are region free! So yes, you absolutely *can* use the Japanese version on a US console. The physical remotes are no different between regions, only the box and instructions. And yes, these newer, awesomer remotes include the Wii Motion Plus accessory built-in, and it can be used on the original Wii console as well as the Wii U. So as you may gather, these basically have 100% compatibility with whatever you want to use them for!

Two non-rechargeable AA Panasonic batteries are included to get you started. So just pop those in, and push the small red sync button on the back of the remote where the battery compartment is, as well as the sync button on the front of your Wii/Wii U. One other great thing, is unlike the older Wiimotes, the sync button can be pressed through the case and rubber sleeve, so you *don't* need to remove the sleeve or battery cover to sync the remote. You will, however, need to remove them to insert or replace the batteries.","AWESOME theming, region-free so it will work on your US Wii / Wii U!",1430092800,33,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NQzeyLtFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BtB--J4FL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pFp+yOEBL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mzYaIwF+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KHt5nH7QL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Tht5TUUaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71phKJWzbxL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P6WeBqNqL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EWLNS3-WL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KhZd2SkIL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+ejPHLDJL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BBeOLyrLL._SY88.jpg']"

I had PlayStation 2 before and was bored overall with it minus the call of duty series. So I guess that's why I stayed away from gaming until now. Be sure you push the A/V cable in firmly when you set up. Also my Comcast wireless internet kept dropping while trying to download the Tomb Raider game you get a code for. So I moved it right next to the modem and its been fine. I have it placed in the open on top of a table but its still has over heated 3x in less then a month. So I hate all this download content the game makers push as extras off the disc since it over heats.

People had LAN parties before high speed internet service was the norm. Pretty much everyone has high speed these days so again, the LAN gripe is irrelevant.

Now, for a realistic review of this game... it's awesome. The game looks fantastic and the game play is even better that the original (which is hard to do).
The only realistic downside is that you can only play the Terran campaign. Obviously the other two faction campaigns will come later on and at the full add-on price (which sucks).  However, seriously people, with all of that said this game IS awesome.

Follow Up:
After continuing to read negative reviews of this game I've come to the conclusion that (apparently) the majority of the people who bought this game are a bunch of whiney little babies who probably still live with their parents even though they are now in their 30's.

Point 1 - LAN is irrelevant. 99% of the people playing this game also play WoW (you know you do). How is WoW played? Oh right, over the internet. LAN is not an option for this either so stop crying about it.

Point 2 - The graphics ARE great. If you don't think so you ARE wrong. If it doesn't look good on your machine you're doing something wrong or you need a serious hardware upgrade.

Point 3 - If the entire game as a whole is not good enough for you then your expectations were too high to begin with.  The game is what it is... a significant upgrade of the original with a continuing story line.

Finally, and I do mean finally... the game is great. We all know Starcraft 1 was and still is an awesome game, that's obvious, but with that said SC2 makes the original look like a turd.  These are facts.  You're welcome.",LAN?!  Really people?!,1280880000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"01 27, 2015",A10W2QTBTVV6RQ,B00D2ZK1IG,Jessie Scott,"Hello and welcome!  So you want to be a slayer of undead?  You've come to the right place.  Some of you may remember Island of the Dead.  Well, if you survived that nightmare, you're in for a treat!  We'll build on what you already know to make you even better.  If not, well not to worry - you'll be fully trained by the end.

Controls: The tutorial shows you the ropes; spend as much time as you need to get a handle on how to move.  Once you do, leaping, climbing, dropkicking, sliding, bashing and slashing is all very easy and smooth.  R1 jumps, and holding it down while allow you to grab onto ledges and pull yourself up.  Everything is fluid and the characters handles extremely well.  If you're like me, you'll end up wasting a few firecrackers when first learning the moves.  In short order you'll be flinging daggers with ease, luring zombies with panache, and lighting up the undead with style.

Gameplay: You'll be running to various locations to complete tasks.  At your disposal is a myriad of options to dispatch, or avoid, the undead menance.  For instance, one of our favorites:
""The Classic"": use a firecracker to lure the zombies into a group and then toss a molotov on them.
""The Friendly Fire"": You will discover the big guy with the larger rebar club can, and will, smash his own buddies up.  Lure them together and watch the mayhem ensue!
""The Impaler"": various traps are strewn about, such as spikes, fire, and electrocution.  When they're in range, kick them in and watch the (reanimated) body count rise!

Crafting: You will collect various items to craft with.  As your skill goes up, you can craft additional items with added effects (like exploding shuriken, why wouldn't you want those?).  Some items are crafted in batches too, so make sure to pay attention to the amount you can receive by making something.  Weapons you find can also be broken down into parts or sold, so make sure to choose wisely.  If you find yourself hauling around too much, toss it into your teleporting gym bag that you are gifted.

Skills: We will focus on three areas - Survival, Agility, and Strength.  These are independent and you earn progress separately.  Survival: help people by doing quests, Agility: run and do parkour stuff, Strength: bash zombie heads in.  When you receive a point, throw it into the perk you want and become a certified zombie slaying BA.

Day and Night: Be careful when the suns starts to set.  Things... change.  They get faster, deadlier.  Soon, you'll find that you are the one that is hunted.  If you find yourself out at night, use everything in your arsenal to make it to the safe zone.  Otherwise, you'll wind up another piece of dead meat.  During the day, you'll find they are slower, dumber.  Still deadly in groups, but much easier to manage.  You'll get one or two of the crazies - the fast angry ones (we call them virals).  Put them down quickly as they are relentless.  And make sure to move quietly.  Sound attracts them.  Use this to your advantage.

Music: We are fans of sci-fi electronic style music, like Mass Effect, so we've included some for you to listen.  It may not be epic, and slightly repetitive, but the main point is to focus on helping us and killing stuff right?  At least you'll enjoy the crunching bones, eerie moans, crackling fire, and our (sometimes) great conversations.  To be honest, it's not clear where we are from; maybe somewhere in India?  A little Australia thrown in?  Who cares!  You're going to kill the undead and have a fantastic time doing it!

Graphics: Killing zombies never looked so good!  While not extremely fluid (30FPS), there is so much to see that you'll feel engrossed in the world.  The little touches make the world feel... alive.  The irony!

Story: You're not one of us huh?  It's easy to tell because of your skin color and accent.  That's okay, I don't mind that you're trying to infiltrate our organization to find someone to get some documents back while at the same time helping us to get closer and earn our trust.  You didn't really come here to be passed down in legends though, did you?  No, you want to make things burn and explode.

Online: You can't connect?  You tried for 30 minutes?  Well that's a shame.  I guess we can't speak too much about that until matchmaking works for us again!  We have the ""Be the Zombie"" mode, so maybe we can use it in the following days.  It will be interesting to play an undead hunter, will it not?  Time will tell.  Well, at least you can team up with three other friends and go on a slaying spree together.  Remember, team work (and some friendly competition) will go a long way to surviving!  You can also specify if you want others to be able to ""invade"" you as undead.  If you're faint of heart, it may be better to avoid these competitive types.

Overall: If you want to kill the undead, this is the way to go!  The game is polished, and while the Dead Island influence is obvious (and expected) it is leaps and bounds better with upgrades, updates, and fantastic visuals.  The story leaves something to be desired, but I, like many others looking to kill the undead, tempered my expectations for something that's a bit campy, but gets the job done.

Concerns about the endings were largely from obsessed fans (like me) shocked by the conclusion to a beloved trilogy, and anyone not particularly invested in the story would not be bothered enough by the ending to regret playing it.

The gameplay has been vastly improved from Mass Effect 2. Turning no longer feels like the distant cousin of old school Resident Evil controls, sprint is now unlimited, guns can be customized with mods that physically alter the appearance of your weapons, the enemies require strategy and a well-balanced squad, and many of the powers are just flat-out cool. While the mission variety is less fulfilling then ME2 (ME3 missions are almost exclusively shooting missions) the shooting is so vastly improved that one doesn't particularly mind.

As an ME fan through and through, the story is one of the best I've seen in a game. Resolving centuries-long conflicts that have been built up since ME1, solidifying alliances one never thought possible, seeing the Reapers finally in action, finding love that had been developed through hours of story... it all adds up to an incredible experience. While the dialogue options are less varied than in previous games, the dialogue itself is more well-written.

Of course, the ending was terrible. I don't want to spend too long on it because most people know the deal by now. However, what I do want to mention is that the Extended Cut released as DLC for free by BioWare has done much to correct the one glaring flaw in this otherwise fantastic game. It is not perfect; the final reveal of the Reapers motivation does not quite do them justice, and the player might be curious to find that the overarching theme of Mass Effect has, according to the writers, been what many players thought was only a sub-theme situated in order to give context to the larger themes. It still feels unnecessarily dark, as if BioWare did not think that a game in which friends, races, and even planets are sacrificed in the name of the war had enough sadness. Your war assets and the decisions you make during the previous games still has little noticeable impact on the final mission.

However, the EC has fixed most problems that could have been fixed without a complete rewrite of the last half hour. Most of the plot holes have been fixed, the characters - so callously cast aside in the original ending - are given more time to shine. Related to this, a post-ending speech and slideshow of the ME characters lives after the end are given to the player to provide a sense of closure, and the final ""Buy DLC!"" message screen has been replaced by a message thanking the fans. With the EC, BioWare has proven (was there ever any doubt?) that they care as much and probably more about their fans than any other large development company.

With the EC, stellar gameplay, incredible soundtrack, and quality voice acting and dialogue, this is a game on par with the rest of the series; high praise indeed. It is also my personal favorite and a game for which anybody should be able to find the time.",The Complete Package - Post-EC Review,1341619200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The game is highly refined, beautifully crafted, and smooth.  There are two modes of play ""Classic"" Sonic, and ""Modern"" Sonic.

Classic Sonic:
A polished form of the original Sonic formats, this delivers 100%.  It plays exactly how you would want it to, and has no choppiness or off-beatedness.  So there you have it, at least half the game is exactly what most people are looking for... specifically.

Modern Sonic:
This is what we've seen in basically every Sonic game from the millenium til now, but without all the gimmicky crap.  It is basically a less restricted version of Classic, therefore being way faster paced, and potentially much more difficult.  You have to get through levels in a much different way, yet it still feels ""Sonicky""  I think even retro fans will be satisfied with it.

You've seen all the levels before, sort of.  When played on the Classic mode, the earliest stages will be the exact same format as they were on the Genesis, but they look much prettier.  But the two acts of each level work differently than in prior games. Act 1 is played with Classic Sonic, Act 2 is the modernized version.  Now you can run through Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant in a totally revolutionized way!

There are also challenges, mini-levels that take place on existing levels with a special restriction or enhancement, and a specific section of the track and a time-goal.  Some are rather tedious and aren't very fun, but the majority are very entertaining and add ""gimmicks"" that really spice up the experience.

All in all this is in the running to be the best Sonic yet, and it's really about time.  My review is probably a little lacking in detail, so if you have any questions, comment em.",Forget all the tears you have ever shed over modern Sonics,1320364800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Must have taken 50 tries. Had to stop and continue the next day. Other than that, I found it very comfortable and not many other challenges too steep to keep me from continuing through to the end. I just figure that a computer game should be more relaxing and entertaining, and this seemed to fill that need best yet in the TR series ..... my perspective anyway.

-Car selection is large and awesome. Many cars that I would never want to drive, but I love having the options.
-Simulation at it's finest for console.

Best part is that the game is hella long. so the goty comes with a second disc that has about all dlc's (except for costumes) this makes the game very worth gettinf because the add on content is crazy... its a whole lot. Theres hundreds of thousands of different weapons (each has its own feel) some guns are weak others are better. theres a leveling system to where you actually do feel that you have leveled up theres also some bonus stats that can boost up specific things on your character like gun accuracy, melee damage, maximum health, etc. the game also has a somewhat perk system where you unlock these certain skills (well more of a skill tree) that gives a boosts to your character (these things are important and they all help you along as you gain experience points and level up, fighting tougher enemies. The games world is just gnarly, it really makes you feel thst your in there. The story is pretty decent you will somewhat lose track of the story due to side quests youll be doing here and there but its okay each main mission will remind you where you are at. All the characters are exciting and intresting even the enemies in the game. This game is truly a gift from god. Minor complaints are that there isn't a wholw lot to customize on the specific character you pick. There will be certain parts where the game gets tough but once you level up you will often change weapons you use since they will become weaker on stronger enemies youll face but every good gun in the game (that isn't a common weapon) feels right as you see your enemies takig alot of damage. honestly this is a good game and after playing one of the dlc's and finishong the games main mission there is still a whole lot to do (and im barely at level 33) if your lookig for a game that doesnt cost alot and is very long and fun you really need to get this quickly whether new or used.",Easily the best shooter for fps fans,1440547200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Having received my copy of the game early this morning (April 10, 2015, the day of release), I'm about 8 hours into the gameplay. From what I can tell, and through what I have experienced thus far, the story, characters, world, and general gameplay promises hours of engaged journeying through what is definitely the most beautiful world crafted specifically for the New 3DS yet.

For those of you who have already purchased your New 3DS, and if you're a fan of the RPG genre, I would give this game a ""must buy"" recommendation.

For those of you who do not yet have the New 3DS, but the original 3DS, is it worth upgrading *for this one game alone*?! My opinion, for any upgrade, is never for just one game. However, I have compared a few games (Bravely Default, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and Etrian Odyssey IV) side by side on the 3DS and the New 3DS. I have come to the conclusion for a dedicated 3DS gamer, the upgrade to the New system is entirely worth it. That shared, if you do upgrade, this is a must have title!

A simple review, I know, but again I've only had the game a number of hours. I'll aim to revisit and update this review, but for now, this game earns my highest praise and I'm excited for others to also discover the Xenoblade Chronicles world I'm discovering for the first time.","Missing the chance on the Wii, after 8 hours of gameplay Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a must have New 3DS game!",1428624000,78,,

It's pretty nice, definitely much faster to start up and get to the dashboard, but my power-brick sounds like a tiny vacuum cleaner, not to mention it runs just as hot as the console. Why couldn't they incorporate it in the design anyways? I decided to be dumb and buy the harddrive migration kit for $20, which did work great, however I recommend just buying a 16gb usb drive if you're still rockin' the 20gb hdd like I was. I don't plan on using the wifi, and didn't even check to see how to set it up, but it will save you $100 if you need it.

The main reason I bought this was the whisper quiet aspect, which is hard to judge. Compared to my old zephyr, it is whisper quiet, however watching a movie (Netflix instant streaming) with quiet scenes yields a small buzz from the psu, just enough to annoy me (though to be fair, it's very similar to the fan in my PS3 slim which I've been using to watch Netflix). I may end up calling MS to see if I can get it replaced (if it's not a universal problem), but overall I would rather have a small buzz than a jet engine, and is well worth the upgrade. Did I mention I don't have to delete content off my hdd every time new dlc comes out now?!

As a side note, the d-pad on the controller seems much better than the old ones. I haven't bought a new controller since 2007, so this may be universal now, but it has a much larger range of motion than the old one.

My perception is not limited by nostalgic expectations. This is the best CoD since Black Ops 2, and from what little experience I have with MW2, MW3, and Black Ops 1 and World at War, likely the best CoD to date. The old games were fine for their time but pale in comparison to Black Ops 3. Nostalgic fans who are resistant to change will be disappointed at another evolution in mechanics and theme, so if you are one of the vets hoping for some classic CoD, this is not for you and CoD may never be again (save remasters like the upcoming MW1 remaster). However if you are a versatile FPS fan looking for a faster pace, more fun and truly next gen reinvention of CoD, then this is a perfect game. New mechanics to switch up the gameplay and give you much more maneuverability as well as actual different characters with different abilities, making the game way more exciting and competitive than past CoD's ( moreso than Advanced Warfare, as much as the old heads will hate that I said that AW is the closes in competitiveness). The game's campaign is honestly not that great but few people play CoD for campaign these days. The campaign is online MP and has a progression system and calling cards so if you do like campaign then you will be glad for this, and hopefully this will transfer to future CoD's. Once you beat campaign there is another zombies campaign, Nightmare Mode (might be available from the beginning now) and while the campaign is pretty much the same levels with zombies, it's still a second option and was a neat idea.. personally hoping Treyarch will do better with that in the future. Multi Player is solid. Wall running, thrust jumping, sprint reloading and shooting, specialist weapons and abilities, cool outfit customization options... if you are an FPS fan and aren't polluted by negativity then you will love this. They also have a Dark Matter camo which you get for getting diamond for all weapons. Also, Zombies is pretty good. I haven't played it like I did Black Ops 2 but I have completed everything aside from trophies and easter eggs. Zombies now has calling cards and weapons you unlock and can level up, which are leveled up as soon as you get them from the wall or box. You customize upgraded guns with your choice of attachments. There are some cool reticles and camos for zombies too. I was hoping for better progression in zombies but it is definitely an improvement compared to nothing. Hoping for more updates with future DLC, like Extinction had when the armory came out. Zombies also has gobblegum as well, which are basically perks that are too good to last until you get downed, so they are single use or last for short durations. Gobblegum options unlock as you level up and playing also gets you vials that you can use to gamble for mega gobblegum, hwich are way better than the standard gobblegum. DLC comes with more gobblegum and there are some really good ones in DLC 2, still waiting on DLC 3 and 4. There is also free run mode which is a timed trial to get through an obstacle course, and there is Dead Ops Arcade 2. Both of these aren't that great in my opinion, but still add to make up a large amount of content in this game. There are definitely improvements I want to see in the next Treyarch game, but that's to be expected with so many new ideas packed into a single game. This is definitely an improvement upon the five star Black Ops 2",This is the best CoD since Black Ops 2,1464998400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have a hard time carving out a gym schedule and was in the process of terminating a gym membership when this game arrived. Wow! If you are a gamer - the kind of person who is driven to earn points and achievements - this is the game for you. Even after a month, I felt driven to work out regularly to meet the goals I had set for myself.

The kinect is just the tool for a video-game workout. Although (as others have mentioned) it sometimes misses your moves and you don't get the points you should - which can be frustrating - this is only a tiny minority of the time (although it happens most often with things like sit-ups that have you on the floor). The graphics are crisp and things happen as you progress through a workout that keep it visually stimulating.

My favorite activity is wall breaking, which involves using your hands and feet to knock out blocks in a grid. The dance classes are fun, and the workout routines can range from laid back to cant-catch-your-breath challenging.

I would highly recommend this game to anybody looking to get in shape and lose some pounds, or who has a limited budget or a difficult time getting to the gym, and especially if you are the kind of person who will do ridiculous things to excel at video games!",Excellent and fun workout!!,1328832000,,,

Shutter is my favorite. You pose as a reporter taking pictures for her boss. Aim the game pad at the TV and click a button to take a picture like a camera!

Skiing and Patchwork were both 3.5/5. They were ok but did not have the same zeal arrow and Shutter did.

Kung fu and Ashley are your typical adventure games controlling characters in some way to try to get them to the end of the course.

Design is a fun estimating game were you try to follow the directions of a mad dr.

I found that gamer was good but not as good as it was made out to be. The plot is that you are a kid trying to beat your video game after bedtime and avoid your mom at the same time.

Captain Wario was one of my three favorites along with Arrow and Shutter. You have to block arrows shot by captain Wario to the beat. The game pad serves as your shield.

Taxi and bowling are a but frustrating because of the controls. In bowling the ball never goes were you aim it and in taxi the perspective is always changing so you can't really tell were your going

The multiplayer games were ok. Islands is a big boring board game and disco didn't make sense. Fruit is fun for the thief but impossible for the agents. Sketch was the best of the four. It is similar to pictuonary, but on the game pad.

I opened Turok yesterday, put it into my Gamecube, played for about an hour, and got a horrible feeling of regret for buying this game before trying it out first.  I was on the verge of putting it on Ebay.  These levels are terrible, and quite possibly some of the most painful gaming moments I've ever had.  I decided to bite the bullet and play out the first 2 chapters anyway.  Then things got much, much better.
Apparently, chapters one and two (each with 3 to 5 sub-levels) are designed to ease you into the controls and mechanics of the gameplay- they are designed poorly, the computer AI is atrocious (they just stand in one spot firing a steady stream of bullets until you shoot them down), and overall they are just a chore to play through.
From chapter three on, however, things change.  The levels are bigger, the difficulty gets a boost, and the computer AI gets unbelievably smart- the soldiers and animals react in a realistic way, and you'll never see the same pattern of combat more than once.  They hide behind rocks, kill dinosaurs to use as cover, and will occasionally gang up on you when your life meter gets too low.  It's very similar to the AI in Halo.  Amazing.  Also, there are plenty of weapons to choose from- my personal favorite is the sniper rifle.
My point- give this game a try, and don't judge it based solely on the first few levels.  Trust me- it will get exponentially better as you play, and the fun factor goes through the roof.",Great game once you get past the first few levels,1030579200,,,

This game also focuses more on platforming than just running through the stage, and there a good amount of collectables on each level.  Unlike Lost World, a game that I dispise greatly, the controls works very well.  Double jumping and homing attacks are still napped on the same button, but it's not really a problem here.  The graphics also look good on the platform, except for the giant metal worm which look like something out off a DS game.

5.0,False,"11 8, 2013",A1S5QVS3YLY6FK,B00AY1CT4U,TW,"I was really on the fence about buying this game. My history with football video games.
I go as far back with football games to be able to remember running through the right side of the screen only to appear on the left side to make an interception on Atari 2600's football game. So I'm pretty old when it comes to football video games, however, I have had a love/hate relationship with Madden. I bought it every year from the original version through the 2002 version. I didn't buy another until 2012. I was able to get my yearly football fix with the NCAA game. When I bought Madden 2012, it was based on reading reviews of Madden 2013, which led me to believe there wasn't a franchise mode. Franchise mode is my favorite and only mode I play. So I went with 2012 instead.

When this Madden 25 came out, a lot of reviews led me to once again believe there wasn't a franchise mode. Some also talked about the franchise mode being similar to MLB The Show, where you only play the plays your player is directly involved in. I wasn't happy with either of these possibilities, my other concern was not being able to create a player to use in franchise. So I'm going to answer these all directly since I'm sure there is at least someone out there wondering these same things.

#1 There is a franchise mode. There are 3 to be exact. One as a player, one as a coach, one as an owner. Now, the player option is what I had read about. You create a player and you only get to play the plays that directly have you involved. I know what you're thinking, ""Aren't all 11 players directly involved in every play?"" Yes, but EA doesn't seem to believe that. I tried this mode for a quarter and quit. Coach and Owner mode allows you to use every player, call plays, etc... These two feel pretty much identical to the franchise mode on Madden 2012.

#2 Which led to the question of being able to create a player to use in franchise. You can do this. You do it from the main menu before starting a franchise, create your player, pick a team, give him all 99s if you want and when you go to start a franchise there is the option to import/load a roster, this roster will have your created player in it to use in franchise. You also can edit every single player on every team from the main menu. These edited players will appear in the import/load roster file when you start a franchise. So far, so good.

The game itself is fun. This is after I moved the sliders for a full night, testing out each until the game played the way I wanted. I have always found that I have to improve the computer team's rush defense AI and the computer's team's pass offense. This game is no exception. Playing on the default setting, I had 6 interceptions and held the opposing QB to 11/32 passing. After fiddling with the sliders, the same QB threw for 2 TDs and 2 interceptions against me with a 17/31 completion/attempt ratio. The rush defense was even worse. On the default setting, I had 417 yards rushing on 28 carries, with two running backs rated 73 and 80, in one game. After adjusting those sliders, the same two running backs combined for 178 yards on 34 carries. Making for a much better challenge.

I've played one full season and admittedly, didn't lose one game, but I did have a couple of very close games, 24-17, 31-28 and 34-31 OT win, This is a huge improvement over the default difficulty settings where my closest game was 56-10.

I am playing in the owner mode which adds a few different twists like raising/lowering prices on merchandise to renovating your stadium to relocating your team. I don't think it adds much to the game experience, but it's not a negative either.

When I play a football game I only have one major want, a challenging, but not frustratingly challenging game. By frustrating, I mean linebackers who jump 48 inches off the ground to bat down or intercept my pass to my wide open receiver. This game has its bad AI moments, but it is more playable than 2012, which I did like pretty well. If there's any major complaint it's that they are trying to get too complex with the control system. Some of the combo spin, juke, hurdle moves are getting into fighting game complexity. I don't think these have any place in a football game. In a fighting game, it's not too much to think you can tap A while moving the control stick in a half circle. In a football game where there are multiple players trying to tackle me, pushing right stick - right, right stick - left, right stick - up, before one of them hits me is a bit more control than I want.

As I'm wrapping up, I want to say that I don't touch the online game nor do I do anything that requires me to spend more money. On games like Sleeping Dogs, GTA, Skyrim, I don't mind investing in DLC that extends the game for me. On Madden, everything I could want and need is in the game, so I have very little opinion on the Ultimate Team mode or anything online. I think I learned my lesson on NBA 2K13 when I spent around $50 upgrading my player and buying special animations, which ended up burning me out on it.

I would recommend this game. Everything in it needed adjusting, from the sliders to the camera angle, but once I had everything balanced out, I felt like I was playing a solid game of football.",Caught me by surprise,1383868800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"03 17, 2014",ANS7PVYBOXVGO,B00000DMAR,JackLiberty,"Well lets end the Crash Bandicoot trilogy on PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. This game was released in 1998 and was once again, developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios. It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store.
 The games story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Akus evil twin brother; Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games. Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth.
 The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game. You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game. You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does; but don't worry, the levels are completely different from each the second game. The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game. The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal is the same as the second game; obtain the crystal hidden in the area. Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race. The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes, or completing a hidden level or task. Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber, a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available to play. By defeating a boss you unlock a new power, theres the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful, the double jump, a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period, a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.
 The newest main feature in the game is the Relics which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game. After you obtain a levels crystal, you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail. The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can, but there are some differences: There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time, there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die, you have to start the level from the beginning; but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and thats pretty much it. It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them.
 This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall, period. I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $6, this is a MUST PLAY. It really is one of the best.

Graphics aside this game is kickass all around from the gameplay,multiplayer,though a standard deathmatch would've been awesome (HINT Cliffy B) The cover system took a little to get used to but, after 3 min into the game it becomes second nature.

My kids and I went all the way through Diablo II on the LAN and since then I've been trying to find a good coop game to play with them, with not much luck at all. The games I've tried have either been way too difficult and involved or took so much horsepower to run that one of my PCs wouldn't run it. And it seems like LAN play is dying off, too.

Trine seems like it will fit the bill perfectly. It only takes one PC for everyone to play on, so as long as you have a pc that will run it, you are set. It's nice visually, entertaining for the kids, has a little thinking involved in it (it's not just a hack and slash).

Sonic 4 Episode 1 was close but still lacking something; I felt like I was replaying original Sonic with better graphics and worse parts from new genration Sonic games such as homing attack and stiff movement.
I was doubtful of Sonic Generations because its reviews from game reviewers were similar to those of Sonic Colors..
After playing Sonic Generations, my doubt is gone. Yes! Sonic is finally back!!
The Graphics are excellent. This excellence starts from design and color choices; they are pleasant to look at. The Sonic Team paid a lot of attention to details and presentation.
The music is just wonderful. Very joyful and warm. It brings me a full of nostalgia.
Unfortunately, the new-generation Sonic and his friends still talk; fortunately, not much dialogues. The baby Sonic is the only the mute character while even baby Tails talks.
I have two different gameplay impressions:
The baby Sonic part is very fun and speedy. The game play direction is clear, and control is easy.
The mature Sonic (aka new generation Sonic) part is better than its predecessors but can't compare to the baby Sonic. Its button timing based game play is not what I want to do with Sonic.
It's clear that the baby Sonic is the Sonic I want to play again.
Sonic Team, please continue future development with the baby Sonic!

The game is pretty fun, it has a RPG element to it, so leveling up is fun and make you work for it. If you are new to the game, you pick either an Assault, Medic, Engineer or Sniper.

* Assault refills your team with ammos and is imo the best mid to close range fighter.

* Medic is a healer and revive your teammate when they die. He also is able to quickly heal your team back up to full health.

* Engineer helps repair vehicle and is expert at destroying vehicles. This class is pretty crucial on the map where vehicles dominate the playing field. He's not as strong as the Assault in the firefight.

* Sniper is able to call for airstrikes and has ability to shoot from a very long range.

In this game you get what you earn, meaning not everyone on the team gets the same XP every round. If you choose to be a sniper, and you can't kill anyone, you're not going to get that many points to level up.

Luckily, if you're like me and can't hit a moving target... you gain many points for supporting your teammates. My kill ratio are usually 1 kill for every 4 deaths, but at the end I'm always up in the top 3. That's because I run around healing and reviving my team as a medic. You don't need to be good at shooting to score big. Even as an engineer you can support and score big. Place landmine on the road to kill vehicles, tracer gun, repair vehicle, etc. So, don't get discourage to play this FPS game even if you're not good at FPS.

It's a beautful system, and when you fold it shut, the screen shuts down, and a green light blinks, letting you know that it is using minimal power.

I owned one of these for a good year, year and a half. But then I sold it to an ex-friend's brother for 40 bucks. Forgive me, I was desperate, and wanted a DS (although I didn't put the money towards one =P)!

All the elements that make a wonderful adventure game are here; an intriguing story, great environment, interesting characters to interact with, and it can even make your heart pound. I have played it a numberless amount of times. This is a game that is timeless.

The Story:
The game begins in a shabby apartment during World War II where you, an ex-secret agent, are still brooding over the mission you failed on the Titanic decades ago. However, you get another chance when the Germans bomb the city and you go back in time to that fateful night onboard the Titanic. Your mission begins when your contact onboard instructs you to find the stolen copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. And the adventure officially begins; murder, blackmail, hobnobbing with the first class passengers-you name it. Besides the main plot, there are secondary plots you can get involved in, which make the game all the more interesting. You can die in the game, and you can also loose; however, if you win, it's a feel-good ending-except that you can't save the Titanic from sinking. At least I haven't found a way to.

Environment:
Except for the very first and last part, the game takes place onboard the RMS. Titanic. This was a great environment for me since I am especially interested in the inside of the Titanic. However, either way, it made an excellent place to set a spy/mystery adventure game, from the luxurious Grand Staircase, to the long, silent corridors of Scotland Road. The interiors of the ship are surprisingly accurate, despite a few errors, and Titanic buffs especially will enjoy visiting such places as the first class smoking room, Caf Parisien, reception room and even the ship's inner workings. There are a number of places at are non-accessible or locked, such as the palm court, the first class dining salon and much of the second and third class areas. However, there is still a large amount of space to navigate; in fact, you might even want to consider taking the tour so you can familiarize yourself with the ship before you play the game.

The Characters:
There are live actors in this game, instead of computer-animated characters. The acting is some of the best I have ever seen in a computer game, and the characters are well-developed and believable. There are all types of people on this ship ranging from the young American couple on their honeymoon to the evil German Colonel.

Other Aspects: This is a first-person adventure game; you move around using the arrow-keys on the keyboard. Once you get the hang of them, you can move very quickly. The game also has a map of the ship, and certain areas are highlighted so that you can instantly ""jump"" to them without having to run there yourself. (When the ship is sinking, this ""jumping"" feature is disabled) The graphics in this game are good; the biggest problem with them is that when you move they blur for a split second. However, if there are newer versions, this might be cleared up.
""Titanic,"" is moved forward mostly by dialogue and certain actions, such as retrieving a painting, unlike many adventure games today, which seem to be more mystery/puzzle games. You go from one puzzle to another to another or have to spend half the playing time moving the mouse over every inch of the interface in attempt to find some infinitesimal object.

As I said earlier, ""Titanic"" is a great adventure game, and, at least for me, setting standards that no other adventure game has matched. Hopefully, the creators of the new adventure games try to follow ""Titanic's"" example and in the future make actual ""adventures"" instead of endless puzzles.",Two Thumbs Way Up!,1208995200,,,

To me if you want to be a true gamer, you need a real NES (or a NES-101 those are cool to and don't fail as often but they are expansive). Here are three reasons why.

1. Almost all of the classic Nintendo characters started here! Think about it. Mario, Link, Samaus, Megaman, and Kirby started here. With this system you can pick up a real copy of Super Mario Bros. or Gradius and go nuts and play them the way they were meant to be played.

2. Will work on a modern HDTV. While this baby won't have HDMI cables you can hook it up with AV cables or an RF cable. It is very easy to set up and unlike a Atari 2600 it won't require fiddling with to make it work.

3. This is just a myriad of reasons... Easy to use controller. Don't have room? This system is flat so you can stack another system or cable box on top of it. Have a buddy/sibling that you actually enjoy playing video games with? There are many great two player video games. Love RPG's? This system is the granddaddy of em all. This system is the best system for platformers. Like to crack open and repair video game systems? This one is for you while there are many functional NES's there are many broken ones out there.

Technical specs via Wikipedia
For its central processing unit (CPU), the NES uses an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Ricoh based on a MOS Technology 6502 core. It incorporates custom sound hardware and a restricted DMA controller on-die.[jargon] To avoid patent payments, the Ricoh CPU disabled the 6502's BCD (binary coded decimal) mode by removing several of the transistors necessary for enabling it. NTSC (North America, Japan, and Korea) versions of the console use the Ricoh 2A03 (or RP2A03), which runs at 1.79 MHz. PAL (Europe, Australasia, and South Asia) versions of the console utilize the Ricoh 2A07 (or RP2A07), which is identical to the 2A03 save for the fact that it runs at a slower 1.66 MHz clock rate and has its sound hardware adjusted accordingly.

The NES contains 2 KiB of onboard work RAM. A game cartridge may contain expanded RAM to increase this amount. It also has 2 KiB of video RAM for the use of the picture processing unit (PPU), 256 bytes of OAM (object attribute memory) to hold a display list of sprites, and 28 bytes of palette RAM. The system supports up to 32 KiB of program ROM at a time, but this can be expanded by orders of magnitude by the process of bank switching. Additionally, cartridges may contain 16,352 bytes (nearly 16 KiB) of address space reserved as ""Expansion Area"", which often contained an 8 KiB SRAM. Expanded Video memory (VROM or VRAM) may also be available on the cartridge (on-cartridge mapping hardware also allowing further video expansion past 12 KiB). The size of NES games varies from 8 KiB (Galaxian) to 1 MiB (Metal Slader Glory), but 128 to 384 KiB was the most common.

The NES uses a custom-made Picture Processing Unit (PPU) developed by Ricoh. The NTSC version (the RP2C02) operates at 5.37 MHz, while the PAL version (the RP2C07) operates at 5.32 MHz.[2] Both versions output composite video and rely on 2KiB of video RAM (VRAM). The PPU also contains 256 bytes of ""object attribute memory""(OAM) on-die, along with 28 bytes to store the color palette, both on separate internal buses.[3]

The image output by the PPU is made up of two layers, the background layer and the sprite layer. These in turn are made up of groups of 8 by 8 pixel ""tiles"". These tiles use two bits per pixel (BPP), allowing them to utilize 3 colors of the main palette, with the fourth color being transparent. The background layer is represented by a table with indices for each tile, along with a palette selection for each 2 by 2 set of tiles (although ""extended attribute mode"" of the cartridge-based MMC5 memory mapper relaxed this limit to one per tile). The sprite layer can hold up to 64 sprites at a time and is made up of entries to the OAM. Each entry to consists of four bytes (y coordinate-1, tile index, vertical flip, horizontal flip, background priority, and color palette selection). The advantage of sprites over the background is that they can be positioned anywhere on the screen, allowing for moving objects, although they take up extra memory. VRAM is used for tile maps and attributes, while 8 KiB of tile patterns are stored on the cartridge (can be increased with bank switching).[4]

The NES color palette is based on NTSC values rather than RGB values. While it has a logical palette of 64 colors(6-bit depth), there are only 54 unique entries due to how it was constructed (12 hues each with 4 intensity levels plus 2 sets of 4 greys, with 2 intensities of each set being identical). Normally, 25 colors may be used simultaneously: one background color, four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors. To achieve more colors, programmers could switch the color values mid-frame, as well as manipulate ""color emphasis"" bits to modify individual palette entries at specific screen regions, using carefully timed code.[1]

Up to 64 simultaneous sprites can exist at a time (without reloading sprites mid-frame). Sprites can be either 8 by 8 or 8 by 16 pixels, but this setting affects all sprites, so it must be chosen carefully (Contra and Super Mario Bros. 3 for example use 8x16 mode). There can be up to eight per scan line, with a flag determining when to drop additional sprites, allowing software to rotate sprite priorities. Although this can increase the amount of sprites, doing so almost always causes flicker, as they are simply cycled through.[1]

The background layer can be scrolled both horizontally and vertically. The horizontal scroll can be changed per line for a parallax effect, while the vertical scroll can be changed between scan lines for a split-screen effect.[1] This is often done by trapping Sprite 0 and the non-maskable interrupt (triggered during vertical retrace), but the more advanced memory mappers (see below) generate an interrupt for this purpose.

The standard resolution is 256 by 240 pixels, although it was thought for a time that the NTSC console could only display 256 by 224 pixels, as the top and bottom 8 scan lines are not visible on most television sets. For additional VRAM bandwidth, rendering can be turned off before the raster reaches the bottom of the screen or after it had restarted at the top. The PPU registers and memory can only be accessed by the CPU during the vertical retrace phase, causing NES code to be very sensitive to timing, with the programmer having to alter graphics data between frames.[1]

Arcade versions of the NES's hardware use special variations of the PPU: the PlayChoice-10 uses the RP2C03, while two variants of the Nintendo Vs. Series hardware use the RP2C04 and the RP2C05. All run at 5.37 MHz and output RGB video at NTSC frequencies. The Nintendo Vs. Series versions are modified to prevent easy ROM swapping (the 2C04 came in 4 variations with scrambled palettes, and the 2C05 came in 5 variations with two I/O registers switched and a third register returning a specific value in its normally unused lower bits)

It really opens the world up and gives players a unique glimpse into the zombie apocalypse. It is also one of the better co-op games I've ever played. The graphics and the number of zombies have improved quite noticeably since the last installment and as with the last game the DLC is worth playing. One of the other benefits it's that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's nice to just relax and play a game that lets the player create strange and weird weapons and vehicles to take on hordes of zombies and deranged citizens. Unfortunately some of the content is inappropriate and borders on offensive. Fortunately the story isn't that important and can be skipped. Dead Rising 3 has good controls and actually useful followers. The followers have starts this time around and a party can be formed to help with the combat. The people that you save can also use must of the weapons and the weapons can be given to the follower that is best with it.

This isn't the elite squad, or the ultimate soldier, or the secret weapon. Instead, you're with the ""B Company"" of misfits. And you're not out to save the world from impending annihilation. Instead, you're just trying to do what you can to get through the battle with a bit of loot to make your retirement a nice one.

It's funny how the game turns many classic war cliches upside-down. This is definitely irreverent. And still, you have a lot of fun with it, getting to know the characters and their personalities. I can laugh out loud at the dialogue even multiple times through.

The gameplay is fun. There are extensive maps full of items to collect and gather up, and of course enemies to slaughter. You can destroy pretty much anything you want to, and enemies don't constantly regenerate out of some mysterious human-generator just behind the corner. It gives you a sense that this universe you're plowing through is reasonable.

There is a multiplayer mode but we don't tend to be multplayer people. I've heard from others that they love the multiplayer mode. I can report that the single player action is enormously fun and even on replays it still brings a smile.

Are there any down sides here? The game's about shooting and exploding people. It's not meant for little kids. If you're not a fan of combat, this probably isn't the game for you. But we absolutely adore this game. I love the humor, the gameplay, and the landscapes.

This one definitely keeps you playing for endless hours if you decided to do all the side quests or try to obtain all the items.  I'm not a person to do something like that - I personally like to play for the story and nothing more.

The story by itself is intriguing enough to keep me interested. At first the game moves slow only because there is a lot of character building and a lot of cut scenes to keep you interested. After getting past all of that and really into the game, you'll find that the game has a lot to offer. There is the typical leveling up that you need to do especially near the end, and of course a lot of running around.  One of the features I really liked was that the enemies don't just pop up out of no where.  You have the ability to avoid them most of the time. I find it very useful when you get tired of always running into them and just wanting to progress the story.

I think leveling up could have been a little less confusing as you find so many weapons to level up that its hard to figure out what is the best weapon for you to use until it is too late.

You could shoot the driver through the slit in the driver seat, or throw a granade in the top, or blow the treds off or shoot the driver when he pops his head out the top, or any other way that a tank was taken out in World War 2. Also the war is planned out by real commanders, beople who pay the game and worked there way up in rank.

When I saw this game on the shelf I knew I just had to have it.

When I started playing I was happily surprised that there are actually two versions on the gamepak.

The old version is the exact same game I played as a kid with the same graphics, sound, levels, same everything. It's exactly as I remember it (perfect in every way).

The New version is pretty much the same game again but with updated graphics.

I like to switch back and forth playing new one day and old the next and loving every bit of it.

But were they content with giving me everything I ever wanted with this game? Luckily they weren't. I was thrilled to learn they included multiplayer, and only requiring one gamepak no less. You can also get another pak and play an expanded multiplaer with both hooked up.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Crash has been having a stellar time on the Game Boy Advance with his platforming escapades, but what about when he takes the wheel? Well, I may not have played Crash Team Racing on the Playstation, but Nitro Kart gladly fills in my cravings for a Crash Bandicoot kart-racer that is great enough to actually be able to rival the likes of Mario Kart: Super Circuit! I'm serious!! This game is that good!

Crash Nitro Kart has an Arcade mode, which plays out in the usual track-to-track-in-one-of-four-cups structure, but there's also an Adventure mode, where you race on tracks (selected by driving to a portal in a little HUB world) to gather trophies and also race boss characters. The story it tells is admittedly lame (An alien kidnaps the heroes and villains to make them race for the alien's amusement), but everything else checks out exceptionally well!

If Donkey Kong Country's rendered graphics and F-Zero's Mode-7 were thrown together in a blender, the result would most likely be what Crash Nitro Kart's graphics are! This game reeks of eye candy, and it drives home that Mario Kart isn't the only racer on Game Boy Advance that could harness the awesome graphical prowess and still play great! In fact, the control is spot-on; the cars hardly ever feel too slippery, the action is frantic and fast-paced, and the cartoon-ish aspects are played out naturally thanks to the extra touches where you get hit by an item and make a jump or when you ram into a wall. The items are also varied and well-implemented.

Do you love Crash Bandicoot? Or racing games? If so, getting Crash Nitro Kart should be a no-brainer by now, and I wouldn't be surprised if it spends an amount of time in your Game Boy Advance or DS.

UPDATE (5/14/2015): I accidentally found a hidden minigame! Apparently, if you hold L and R while booting up the game, you get a little ""dance"" game called Crash Party USA instead of Nitro Kart. Laid out similarly to a traditional rhythm game, you press certain buttons when they move up to the cursor, and you can move the cursor up or down the rows. It starts out kinda slow, but it picks up at a good pace, and as a result becomes a fun way to kill time.

One problem I always had with the series is the story telling has always been average or below average. Great characters, fun moments, amazing voice acting, with a plot and or ending that Michael Bay crafted. That stops here. This is the best Gears of War story to date, the campaign is short but feels right for a shooter. Now the best Gears of War story doesn't exactly set a bar.
But I promise this story is great compared to any shooter campaign that is decent. The pacing is perfect and there is some funny and touching dialog.

Multiplayer is the best it has ever been, and I think Gears of War 4 has the highest replay value multiplayer ever in the series, even more than Halo Guardians. Graphics are impressive, especially on PC. You can really tell they squeezed the most out. The negative side is if you have played one gears of war game, you have played them all gameplay wise with some minor differences.

Yes this is the most polished gameplay offered so far in the series, but it still feel like Gears of Wars. So if you love Gears of War and the way it plays, you will love this game. If you were hoping for something fresh feeling and new compared to other entries. This maybe isn't for you, and offers nothing be a 6 hour campaign (for me at least).

But for me it is familiar like an old friend who got a make over in the form of new characters, amazing graphics, and a good story. While still retaining the old feel.

Pros
- New characters
- Poor tomato plants
- Poor House
- Music
- Story
- Graphics
- Gameplay
- Best Multiplayer
- Voice acting

Cons
- For some could feel like more of the same.

Gears of War 4 feels like a familiar ride, that offers refinements and new characters that only increases the enjoyment.

FS2k was good but the scenery was rather simplistic, but the new version brought the looks to a totally new level -- and this alone is worth the price!
Looks are not the only aspect that vastly improved.  As the other reviewers pointed out, the framerate is also much better -- something many gamers used to criticize FS2k about.  I run the program on a PIII-733 with Windows 2000 and an old nVidia card, but I'm definitely getting smoother graphics and gameplay than in FS2k.  I haven't tweaked the settings yet, but I'm very satisfied with the framerate.
After a week of heavy play I haven't had a crash -- so I'm hoping this baby is solid.  My experience in the FS2k community tells me that most crashes (esp. the BSOD type) are driver-related.  This program is very demanding of system resources, so make sure you have the latest video and controller drivers as well quit potentially conflicting programs and unplug potentially conflicting devices.

Taking place in a plausible near-future, Call of Duty 4 follows the exploits of two characters: Soap, a new addition to the British SAS, and Jackson, a U.S. Marine.  In terms of time, the game covers 6 days of intense anti-proliferation and anti-terrorism missions.  The SAS spend most of their time hunting nukes and Zakhaev, the leader of an ultra-nationalist faction of Russians battling the government for control.  Meanwhile, the Marines spend their time going after Al-Asad, a militant Muslim who's working with Zakhaev to consolidate his control over an un-named Middle Eastern country.  Although the events of both storylines happen simultaneously, you'll play through both separately as the game progresses, until they converge - then the Marines are working with the SAS.

The action is very fast-paced, with many enemies to shoot at.  It took me until my second time through the game to realize that the game just keeps throwing more and more enemies at you until to make to the next checkpoint.  The environments are completely destructible and higher-powered weapons WILL shoot through plywood, concrete, and other barriers.  For that reason, cover is your friend in this game.  One of the best features of this excellent title is that your squadmates are invulnerable and basically take care of themselves, which means you spend more time worrying about saving your own skin and advancing through the levels than babysitting incompetent soldiers.  They'll occasionally help you out too, nailing enemy troops that may have you pinned down.

Another fun feature of the game is that, although the plot is linear and sometimes it feels like you're on rails when your squad runs off without you, you are allowed the time to explore - your squad will wait at the next checkpoint.  And you should explore - there are some fun cheats that are unlocked for collecting the laptops scattered throughout the game.

The graphics are top notch and the levels are huge.

Probably the only complaint I have for this game, and it's a small one, is that you can't pick your armaments before a mission.  For this reason, you may occasionally find yourself scouring the battlefield, looting corpses for your favorite equipment.

Is this game replayable?  I think it depends on what kind of gamer you are.  Casual gamers might enjoy playing through it a time or two.  Hard core gamers will want to tackle it multiple times at every level of difficulty and find all the hidden goodies.

I've read reviews (Gamespot specifically) that talk about near abysmal framerate/slowdown drops... to the point of freezing the system.  that's cold, man.  and, umm, dead wrong.  I have a feeling someone over there reviewed an unfinished product.  The game is not flawless.  It does have load times every so often (7-10 seconds) but not as bad as Gamespot says (20-40 second load times).  I question the validity of what they were reviewing.  I've never played FPS on PC and I don't doubt it's better.  But I understand to play Half Life 2 on a PC fluidly requires thousands in upgrades, etc.  It's just not worth it to me.  That's a lot of beer I could be drinking, money to be gambling.

Anyway, Half Life 2 is just SUCH a playable game.  The environments are really stunning.  It starts in a train station where you soon learn that this world is throat under boot, a completely fascist regime with civilians walking thoughtlessly like escape psyche ward patients.  You'll soon learn that Gordon Freeman, YOU, has a head on his shoulders and is respected among an underground resistance group.  This game oozes similarities to dystopian society of Oceania in Orwell's 1984.  The enemy in the game, similar to 1984, is a faceless totalitarian one.  You'll see resistance posters on crumbling walls.  You'll feel the burdens of this decadent society.  Moreso, You'll feel respected when people recognize you as Gordon Freeman, the hero.

I can't say enough for the enviroments.  They are so well rendered, such a great world create, to experience it slowly.. EXPLORING is not a chore...  Taking your time is what you'll want to do, to enjoy the visuals that have been so well-crafted.

A big part of this has to do with the putty-like ""structure"" of the levels, IE the ability to interact with 99% of object on the screen.  Breeaking windows and smashing tables never gets old.  It's fun to throw garbage everywhere, stack a bunch of crap.  And many times you'll need to.

The acting and sound in this game is extremely well done.  It's a relief to come across safe havens with friends excited to see you.  Gets you away from the intense action for a little bit, sometimes giving you better weapons.

The controls of the game are very good, right up there with Halo, Halo 2, Doom 3 on the Xbox.  Weapon switching is done via directional pad... It's just real easy to get a feel for.

To wrap it up, the Xbox version of Half Life 2 deserves five stars.  It's not gonna be a best seller and it's going to suck to geeks with PCs.  It will appeal to drinkers/stoners alike who take their vices too seriously to spend that much money on a good PC.  Yet these creatures of myth also respect the opinions of PC gamers.

This is a good looking case; mine is in a deep red color, but it is available in black as well. It has a sturdy plastic outside, and nice padding inside. The dual zippers are convenient. There is also an inner flap that holds three DS cartridges.

The case is designed for various models of the DS, including the oversize XL. Because of this, it is rather large for a standard DS.

The lower strap is meant to hold the normal DS Lite, DSi, and 3DS. The only drawback with this design is that to keep the smaller models from sliding around, one has to fit it under straps. This means that this case is less convenient than cases designed exclusively for these sizes.

As a Republic Commando you take lead of Delta squad, an elite ARC unit. With you are three fellow clones each with their own skills which you can employ to simplify objectives.

First of all the graphics are just amazing. RC presents the Star Wars universe through the eyes of a Jenga Fett commando tasked with tough missions that normal clones can't handle. The scale of ships, transporters, landscapes etc... are all believable. Team and enemy animations are very well done and always fluid regardless how many NPC's are on screen -the Obsidian team behind KOTOR2 should take notes. Visual effects are also interesting and keep you in the game whether its the blurring of being caught in the blast radius of a static grenade or water or oil being wipe off your visor by a laser.

The sound is amazing. The score could possible have been mastered by John Williams himself. Even music from the movies was used. Sound effects are also borrowed from the movies keeping the player in tune with the theatrical releases.

The gameplay is very fun. Although some people may complain squad commands were too simplified and dumbed down, its actually novel telling your squad where to go and not having to worry that they won't full obey the commands due to poor AI. Controls are intuitive and easy to learn.

At the end of the day, Republic Commando offers a new stunning and believable universe in the overcrowded FPS genre. The inclusion of an intuitive squad command system makes the game more enjoyable and always offers something new instead of run, gun, lather, rinse and repeat.

Warcraft III shows the amount of work the developers put in over 4 years. Never before have I ever played an RTS where the races are completly unique, yet balanced perfectly. You have no advantage over another just because you are playing Night Elf to Orcs. Each of the races uses it's own type of building capabilities - the humans can co-operativly build, speeding up time, the Undead summon buildings, which frees up their Acolytes to build something else, the Orcs are safe inside the building while they build it, and the Night-Elves use expendable Wisps to ""summon"" living trees that can move around and fight.
Supply and demand also play a big role. You can no longer overwhelm a player with a huge army of knights or rifleman. Instead, you need to manage an army comprised of many elements. You'll want you melee fighters and your air fighters, your seige units, and your magic units. For Humans, you might use a legion of Knights and Rifleman with 3 or 4 Priests and Gryphon Riders. And maybe for the Night Elves, you'll use a group of Huntresses with another group of Archers and 3 or 4 Ballistas with maybe a Chimera. You get the ideas...

I recommend doing this so you can receive a mega Glalie or mega Steelix (I got Glalie).  There are also additional Mossdeep villagers and heart scale sets, pokeballs, etc...  10 times playing through the demo will clear it.

This is actually a remake (for the nine people who didn't know it) for Pokemon Sapphire (and Ruby) for the GBA over 10 years ago.  The graphics and sound have been dramatically improved of course.  There are also additional improvements and additions that were not present in the original games.  Since I started my Pokemon playing with the DS game Pokemon Diamond, I have not played the original.

I've delved into the game a bit and I can address a few pros and cons for fans of the series:

+ This is a gorgeous game, graphics are on par with X and Y.
+ Music is catchy and high quality when listening through headphones.
+ Mega Evoultions!
+ Better online connectivity and online vs modes, Streetpass is great.
+ Lots of places to use HMs, so a nice need to balance your party.
+ Free range flying later in the game.
+ Decorating your own base!

- Lots of water to traverse...
- Mostly repetitive for those who've played the originals
- Only partially 3D for those that like 3D modes (which I don't use anyway), mainly in battle.

I found myself getting hooked on the controls actually. I'm no professional by any means, but I can actually throw combos and get better everytime I fight. I tried playing FNR3 and it seemed a lot slower in pace and the fighters moved too robotic for some reason. In FNR4 they move a bit more fluid, faster boxing action and you really need to think your next move before ko-ing or getting KTFO yourself. Graphics are about the same, maybe a bit better than round 3, theres actually less loading on round 4 too so its a plus. The soundrack is way better this time and the boxer lineup is one of the best if not the best for any fight night game.

And so I have the tennis, golf and Resort to go with this.  And those come with extra MotionPlus, so I now can multi-play these games.
The fact that these games cannot be played without the MotionPlus should be noted.
The fact that the MotionPlus has its own sleeve to integrate it with the WiiMote means you will not be able to easily use the other WiiMote accessories (Steering wheel, racket add-on, etc).  And you will probably have to remove it so you can fit the WiiMote in the charging station.
However, note that the Nunchuck does connect and work through the MotionPlus, even when the game is not using the MotionPlus

So, it is essential for the special games.  And the games are significantly better for the extra accuracy it provides.  But it's a nuisance in terms of its extra length and the fact it needs the cover fited to provide a robust connection.

First to graphics and sound:  They're stellar, easily the best that the PS2 has achieved yet and every bit as good as Halo.  The animation is amazing and most of the characters look very nearly like human flesh and blood.  Guns and their ammo look incredible.  The sound is also amazing, especially played through a decent sound system with pro logic.  The levels are well done as well, doing a great job to create atmosphere.

Next to the levels themselves:  I can't believe anyone would call this game short.  It's easily the longest FPS to come out since MoH and the story is at least as good as Red Faction.  Every level is full of objectives and great scenery.

AI: Again, I don't know but I must be playing a different game than some reviewers.  The enemy in my game hides, ducks, calls for backup, and does all other manner of strategic things.  Sure, on occasion one of them does something stupid, but that makes it a bit less predecitable and more human.  Overall, the enemy in this game is tough and you'll die in a hurry without strategy.

Ever since I played Demon Souls way back when, I've been hooked on these games and I think this is the best game so far. I really like the new tweaks and special moves that the weapons have but not all weapons are equall nor will you be able to level them up to be worth anything of use such as whips.

5.0,False,"05 9, 2011",A22YCFK2DRZTIV,B00002ST83,Eric Jacobs,"Story: This game actually has a story to it. A fighting game with a story, who knew. The story is: A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world. These seven gods are giant dinosaurs and apes which is pretty cool. Now, as one of these crazy blood thirsty monsters, you are set out to conquer the Earth. The story is pretty good in my opinion.

Gameplay: This fighting game is unlike any other fighting game you'll ever play. I say that because you get to fight as dinosaurs and giant apes, how cool is that ? In this game you play as one of seven dinossaurs/apes (five dinosaurs and 2 apes to be exact). You can either play as Diablo, a hellish looking T-rex, Blizzard, a cold blooded killer ape, Sauron, a crazy telepathic T-rex, Talon, a crazy fast and deadly raptor, Vertigo, the poisonous long necked dino, Chaos, a crazy King kong like ape, and Armadon, a vicious crazy triceratops. Well, just like any other fighting game you got your basic moves like you got your high and low attacks. But, instead of punching and kicking like humans do, in Primal Rage you get to tail whip, bite, slash with your claws, and kick slash with your claws too. Mixing some of those moves up add up to some deadly combos. If you do these fast enough you can make your enemy brain dead for a couple of seconds which means they can't move and it's your chance to get more attacks on your opponent which is very helpful. Each character has there own special moves like Blizzard has his Ice breath attack, and Chaos with his weird fart bubble attack which is weird but cool, Sauron has his telekinetic force field, Diablo has his fireball attack which is pretty rad and those are just some of the cool special moves you can pull off. After you have beaten your opponent in two rounds, you can choose to humilliate them by performing a finishing move on them. (like a fatality on mortal kombat). For example, Sauron's Crusher, he just jumps really high in the air and then he just stomps on corpse and turns it into mushy guts. It's a pretty awesome finishing move. Primal Rage has a 2-player versus mode which is pretty fun to whoop your friends at.

Graphics: The graphics look great with it's awesome looking levels like Diablo's level that has the raging volcano is nice to look at as is Armadon's cave level which looks too cool. The dinosaurs/apes themselves just look fantastic. Blood spraying out of your opponent and yourself is just plain brutal and awesome to look at as is watching your opponents heart explode when you just beaten him.

Sound: The music in the game is interesting with its tribal tunes. The roar and yelps of the dinos/apes sound outstanding.

Combat Flight Simulator is, after all, one heck of a World War II buff's dream games, so I figured its Pacific counterpart would be as good.
I have to admit that I am not the best of pilots.  I still fly at the most basic of realism levels in Combat Flight Simulator (Europe), and that is enough of a challenge.  Facing off German bombers and fighters with Rookie-level artificial intelligence is tough, and I still am not skilled enough to set my realism settings (flight models, ammo loads, enemy skill levels, and sometimes invincibility levels) to 100%
Nevertheless, having completed the two Campaigns in the European theater, I recently decided to try Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator 2:  WWII Pacific Theater.
Although it is similar to its European-set predecessor, CFS2 is markedly different in many ways, both good and not-so-good.
First, the good:
Like CFS1, it immerses players into its WWII setting, using historically accurate settings and time-appropriate aircraft (you don't get Corsairs or Hellcats in early 1942, for instance).  Unlike CFS1, however, the title scenes and end-of-mission screens are rendered in 1940s comic-book style art, which I find more fun than the European Theater game's more documentary-style narration.  I like the ""you are there"" feel of a more story-oriented game premise that has comic book panel art and a narrative voice over that reminds one of either personal war logs or pilots' letters to loved ones back home.
Also as in CFS1, players can fly for either the Americans or the Japanese, although thus far I have only been playing as an American.  Because I have only been flying for seven ""months"" (in the game, not real life), I am still only an ensign, even though I have almost 25 aerial victories and several medals and commendations in my ""jacket"" (service record file).
The game's basic flight control commands are nearly identical to the WWII Europe simulation, although here one has commands that affect artificial-intelligence wingmen.  I have had a hard time getting the hang of this (more on the negatives later, I promise), but with trial and error I am learning.
The graphics, like in many computer advances, are improved from the older game.  The scenery is a bit monotonous in some battles, but that's because the Pacific war took place over large expanses of ocean, with sometimes little or no land below to use for reference points.  The ships here look better than in CFS1, and the planes themselves are beautifully rendered.  I particularly like the visuals when I hit a Japanese plane: if hit just right, Zeroes and Betty bombers have a tendency to catch fire easily.  Microsoft's game designers render this quite nicely, and because the Japanese fighters are particularly difficult to hit in the first place, I just feel so rewarded when flames spurt out of a Zero's cowling and the Mitsubishi product spirals down with a trail of realistic smoke.
The flight models, I assume, are as realistic as game designers can make them.  I've noticed that Japanese fighters are much harder to hit than the German planes from CFS1, and that even enemy planes with ""pilots"" and ""gunners"" at Rookie level are deadlier.  I humbly admit that my realism settings are all at zero per cent; I tried one mission using settings similar to the ones I have on CFS1, and got shot down fairly easy.
The negative features are things that are missing in the game rather than how hard it is to play or the graphics.  Sorely missed is a hard-copy manual.  CFS1 had one, and although it is somewhat intimidating to look at - many game players hate thick manuals - it is nice to know one can read up on how to fly and fight.  Most of the manual of the European Theater game helps gamers understand and learn the context of the game, as well as providing the basics of flight and survival in combat without bogging down into boring technical detail.  CFS2, on the other hand, comes in a smaller box and has all its instructions on Help files.  That is fine for gamers who hate reading manuals or are naturally-born-flyers. But for me, a manual or even a keyboard command card would have been helpful: I still don't know, for instance, how to drop a bomb...which in a few missions has cost me valuable points.  Maybe the ""online manual"" feature saves Microsoft a few bucks, but it's giving me fits.
The other flaw I see is that it focuses on American naval aviation rather than the multi-service aspect of the Pacific air war.  True, CFS1 has a similarly small aircraft selection: only 3 different planes for each combatant air force (for a total of 9 aircraft), but I had hoped to fly a few Army Air Force fighters as well. So far I have seen only one Army plane that is player-flyable, and that's the P-38 Lightning.  I would have liked to fly the P-40 (maybe in a Pearl Harbor introductory game) and the P-51D on escort duty over Japan.  Still, I understand that game design often involves compromises to enable different computers with different capabilities to run this kind of software, so this gripe is not a major one that should deter you from buying this game.",Hell in the Pacific Skies -- CFS2 Soars High!,1055635200,5,,

The screen resolution is great on official Nintendo services/ profucts. It really lacks resolution for things like youtube/ browser (which is awkward to get used to) and it's about average on regular DS games. But it's not 'bad' especially since it's a game system, not an iphone.

The system it self is simply beautiful. It's a matte (thank god) white, but the mickey heads are glossy. The inside/ back are just white, which was what I wanted. It's a big system, but it still fits in my pocket.

I bought the clear plastic Hori case to put on it, as the Mickey heads seem like they could be rubbed off eventually. The case is slightly 'cloudy' but it doesn't show much with this version. I also got Hori screen protectors, which seem pretty nice so far. I highly suggest putting screen protectors on before you turn this thing on. A case is a good idea too, for the finish.

I *would* tell anyone to get this, but with the 'new 3DS' I think it's up to prefrence. The new one does seem to be upgraded, but the finish was wonderful on this one. I chose it over the new 3DS mainly for looks. Mine was fairly late on shipping, but that was a bank-mess up.

Rather than taking place in the 1960's though, this game hikes to 2025 and takes you on a ride. Here's my review. Not to worry, there won't be any spoilers... although there will be heavy emphasis on multiplayer.

I won't tell you about the story of Black Ops 2, but I will tell you how this Call of Duty is different from those previous. Rather than going from A to B to sometimes C, Treyarch makes this game less linear this time around. You have options of what you want to do/where you want to go, and they even affect the mission in minor ways. Your decisions won't completely change the story, but they're a wise addition that should have been added at least a couple years ago. This inclusion makes you feel like YOU'RE playing the game, rather than making you feel like the game is playing YOU. Without ruining the campaign for all of you, I can tell you that this is a game that's single player you will definitely want to go through ... especially if you played the original Black Ops.

Zombies. Well, I have to admit -- don't hurt me -- I wasn't a big fan of Zombies in Black Ops because I felt like the first handful of rounds was a complete waste of time and dragged on needlessly. This time around though, there's actually a STORY to Zombies ... imagine that. While I'm still not high on the game mode, I like it a heck of a lot more than I did in the last game, and I can guarantee that those that loved Zombies before will only enjoy it more. Don't think that's possible? Wait until you play the game. Also, for you stat addicts, Zombie stats will be tracked on Call of Duty ELiTE.

And the thing most people buy Call of Duty for ... the multiplayer. There are countless things to say about this. You'll have anti-CoD people tell you that this is the same game as last year. And the year before. And the year before that. Well, that's frankly not true. Black Ops 2 innovates almost as much as Call of Duty 4 originally did. Like the first Modern Warfare, Black Ops 2 may change the series forever. The whole Pick Ten system in this game is an ingenious idea that will seriously make you think when making classes if you want to compete. If you find that you don't ever use your secondary, add a fourth perk. If you don't throw grenades, add another attachment to your gun. The ability to customize your experience in this way will make you hungry for more unlocks and experimentation.

Treyarch doesn't stop there, though. Black Ops 2 has now introduced a brand new thing called League Play. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newbie to the series, you'll be able to form a clan and face other clans with a similar skill level, thanks to Treyarch's skill-based matchmaking. If competing in heated clan wars isn't your thing, you can of course still hop into a random public match.

Also added to Black Ops 2 is what many people are calling ""CoD Casting"" mode. With this, you can view live streams (or previously recorded versions) of matches. This is going to be a useful feature to many ... especially those that are looking to learn techniques that the more seasoned Call of Duty players use.

Treyarch has done with Black Ops 2 what many people have long begged them to do: Change the series up. A lot of fans and critics felt that Call of Duty was releasing nothing but $60 map packs every year... I have to say, Black Ops 2 ought to shut those people up. From the ability to make personal choices in campaign, to the better-than-ever Zombies mode, to the most balanced multiplayer experience Call of Duty has probably ever had, there's something here for anybody to love. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 may very well be the best game in the series.

4.75/5

+: ""Personalized"" campaign; Zombies; Pick 10 system in multiplayer; Awesome weapon/perk/grenade/equipment balance online.

-: This game is nearly flawless and has added a lot of innovation, but I'm beginning to feel some FPS burnout; Multiplayer maps don't feel as great as I thought the Black Ops 1 maps did.","Great. Not as great as expected, but great.",1352764800,54,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Lucky for us, Homeworld did not fall in that category.  While the original Homeworld gave out a feel of an epic battle between legendary enemies and the survival of a world, Cataclysm gives a more ""personal"" approach.
Where Fleet Command in Homeworld was a woman lacking any form of emotion when she speaks (hooking yourself to a super-computer might just do that), the voice of command in this game actually has personality.  He sometimes anger, sometimes panic, and sometimes is at awe at what is happening around his ship.  You really feel closer to your troops.  Also, most ship/fighter also comes with their own voices and expression (a worker ordered to harvest REALLY didn't sound very... motivated).  You actually feel for them!
What also helps is an equally engaging story.  Although very standard in the Science-Fiction genre content-wise, it is very well delivered.  As Hitchcock once said: ""It is not the cake that is important, but how it is delivered"".  And although player already knows the story just by scanning the cover box, that third mission really delivered the chills!  I really wish game developers put as much effort in establishing a good story...
I must also point out the VERY improved interface.  Where Homeworld stumbled with a lack of waypoints and user-unfriendly order issuing scheme (especially from the Sensor Manager), Cataclysm refined the game to near perfection.
Unit wise, we get a more dynamic fleet.  Where in the original game, only research vessels could link together to form... a bigger research vessel, in Cataclysm, linking up two Acolytes (heavy-fighters) creates a slower, more powerful corvette.  One can acknowledge the tactical advantage of this (speed toward the enemy, linking-up, pummel the enemy, unlink...).  Also, the Command Ship actually ""evolves"" when you gradually turn it from a mining ship into a battleship through the missions.
There is also a ranking system (i.e. ships get better with experience), so there is (supposedly) less incentive of engaging in suicide missions.  Personnally, I failed to noticed any difference in performance between a rookie and a wing leader.

I have the original Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo.  The basic game play is pretty much the same.  You are controlling one of the characters from the Mario universe as you attempt to race around tracks and win.  Along the way, you can pick up power ups to help you or hinder your opponents.  Of course, that means they can attack you as well, so watch out.

With this incarnation, you've got 32 courses to play.  You start out with half of them available and earn the other half as you win races.  They include fun new courses created for this version as well as the best of the courses from the older incarnations of this game.

This game can be played by one person or up to four people, each needing their own controllers.  Naturally, with four players, the screen becomes smaller, so you'd want to have a larger TV.

You can also play this game over the internet.  I've raced against friends across town who also have it.  Or, if none of them are on line, you can race against strangers.  The game will set up matches from your region or around the world.

But what really makes this game amazing in the remote.  Each copy comes with one steering wheel.  That's right.  Just put your regular remote in the wheel and suddenly you can steer your car.  I still haven't figured out quite how they set the receiver to do that.  You don't need to use the wheel, however.  You can just use your remote, although it isn't nearly as much fun.  Heck, you can even use your nunchuck controller if you'd like.

The graphics are quite uneven on this game.  The newer levels look pretty good, but the older ones are done in the same, cheesy style.  Admittedly the entire thing is rather cartoonish.  But it really don't dampen my enjoyment in the slightest.

The Cons - 1. There is a clicking noise that comes from the Joystick but, this isn't that much of a big deal seeing that it doesn't distract you like you think it would. 2. The button layout is not the way you would want it to be. The LB and RB buttons are at the top of the Fighting Stick.

The Pros - 1. Accurate functions when playing fighting games or, Arcade Titles on your computer. 2. The USB cord can be plugged into the XBOX360 or, you can use it with your computer. (with certain programs/additional programs) 3. Doesn't use batteries unlike the wireless controllers which suck up batteries like a vacuum. 4. Has a long cord which allows you to play from a distance if you wish to not sit so close to the television or computer screen.

5.0,False,"10 9, 2014",A26N27LJVQNVI1,B00BGA9ZZ4,Crank,"As of December 8 Driveclub is for all intents and purposes complete as a package. The weather update and addition of challenges and a smooth online experience amounts to a game that is easily of the best products put out this year. Launch was terrible. But now the game is great. It is what it is. Japan DLC tracks were released for free on Jan. 19th. DLC is plentiful for all season pass holders and it is highly recommended you get one.

(In my opinion no one should trust one star reviews unless the reviewer has a very good reason to state why they think the product is a failure. With games evolving over time it even becomes more of an issue as people don't update their reviews over time.)

The launch wasn't the most perfectly planned thing as of late. Much like a game such as Final Fantasy 14 that was plagued by servers being crap for the first week, so goes the case for Driveclub. I am driving in a club and racing online. Weather has added a layer of visual polish and realism that no other racing game at this point can claim. The game stands to evolve over time.

Personally, I haven't had this much fun in a pure arcadey racer since NFS: Hot Pursuit. I like sims like Forza and GT but I also enjoy games like NFS, Ridge Racer, PGR, and Forza Horizon. This one stands with the best in the genre.

First of all the graphic engine here is really good. It is extraordinary when the dynamic cloud cover makes each race seemingly different from the last, along with patches of rain, sleet, snow under lightning and thunderous storms that affect every driving move. That they did not meet launch with weather is FAIRLY disappointing... but only truly devastating to those who do not realize this racing engine is doing weather better than anyone else out there ATM. It is a marvelous real-time lighting engine. Japan will be a new location for future DLC that will be FREE for all buyers, and I can only imagine what they might do for those locations. We continue to get tracks added to the current selection every month. Many of them appear to be very high quality and even better than some of the original tracks.

The IQ of the game does have a few small issues, namely the use of FXAA, among other types of anti-aliasing, but it also is quite smooth in the end and nothing to get hung up about. I am a PC diehard and the only bad things I can say about the IQ on my 42 inch are that it could be a little clearer and certain powerlines or car fenders have some aliasing which is obviously annoying to those of us that supersample and downsample. That is about it on that end all things said. You can always at this point on consoles use more resolution in various elements of design, but what is there is exceptional for a 30FPS game. It is literally THE best look console racer ever made at this point. You can see what the game might look like on a high-end PC in photo mode free cam, available even in the garage. It's glorious and not all that much different looking when you are cruising at high-speeds at least.

The rest of the IQ is pretty stunning and no game on PC or consoles matches the detail of the environments for a racer. Project Cars have some spiffy stuff planned for PC, though I have no faith in the console versions looking that great, but it leans more to the sim category and doesn't play as fun as I thought it might on first try. I will have to wait on that one. The closest game graphically would be Dirt 3, which can look as good, better, and worse in many different ways than this game. And that would also be running on a fairly decent PC with gobs of AA. DC definitely looks better than NFS:HP and Horizon 2. While Horizon has better AA in some places it lacks in others, and the environments are actually fairly plain, though obviously open-world. The lighting here is unmatched by any other racing game currently out. Anistropic shading I hope can be improved in the future. The interiors are the best I have ever seen in any game.

The races in Driveclub are thrilling. The draw distances are jaw dropping. From India to Norway you are going to be impressed by trackside detail and sense of speed. THE SENSE OF SPEED! Never has a game nailed this, and this game nails it in 30FPS no less lol. Excellent motion blur and course design hide the 30FPS fact VERY well. Yes, sticklers will always be able to tell, especially on hard pans, but this is no FPS and the driving is straight enough where the motion blur is ultimately very convincing at least. Cook in that wonderful array of foliage and track detail and I am not sure how you could actively dislike this game. The 'just one more' feeling to break your best times is here and alive in this game more than any other I have played in a LONG time.

Drifting is also one of my favorite things about this game. It just works and it feel perfect to me. Trying to edge out someone is one of the most fun things to do. I have been fighting over scores with a friend and it gets pretty competitive trying to match scores when you get into the top 500 ranks. As of now you can send challenges to anyone you want, club or no club. I have already been entering some frenzied drifts with my club and boy does it get competitive. This is no easy old bird here. You will have to work and perfect your technique much like any sim if you want to race or drift with the best.

Online problems are now all but gone from the game. The launch issues are not something I am going to dock a full star from this review score because honestly there really are none any longer. So far the team at Evolution has been nothing but sincere in their outreach to the community. I preordered this with the season pass and have no regrets or concerns about a refund or whatever for a week or two of dirty servers. This game has enough PGR, NFS, and Dirt 3 in it to make me stop playing those games and concentrate fully on this.

The usual racing modes accompany an extensive online component with challenges, friends and clubs, and plenty to keep you busy. Clubs can have 6 people in them atm and you can level up your club for trophies and cars as well. Plenty of DLC is out. I noted the new location Japan above.... A PS Plus version is going to be unlocked for those that want to play for free when servers are fully stable and able to accommodate the millions that might try it at that point. It includes all the features of the main game, but will only have a few cars and only India to race on. Luckily, India is actually pretty awesome and true to the culture. It is also gorgeous in the rain.

Customization works in the garage and colors on cars can be changed before each race. As of now you have 4 customized car slots you can do whatever you want with, and you also have the Club colors and the factory colors as well. Minor changes with every patch are abundant and really enhance the entire experience compared to launch. They have worked pretty hard on the UI and buttons are fairly programmable. With every new patch this company adds significant enhancements to their game, and this is why a lot of people are upset over the reviews that seem to bash the game for literally no reason other than.... it's a racer and it isn't open world. Well, you can have your open world. The racing here is better than any open-world racer I have ever played and I have played them all thoroughly.

In the end I'm not sure what some notable reviewers expected. There are some hideous reviews out there that seem totally aghast at nothing. How can you, in the name of Eurogamer, dock a game like this for having no 'romance' lol? I mean, if you don't have an agenda and you find yourself using words like romance in your racing game review you need to look for another job. Considering I think the racing in this game is spot on I could even argue with that notion. There is NOTHING like zooming across Canada and Norway from sunrise to sunset and watching the world turn to dark, possibly amidst a snow storm at 150 MPH. I have seen no game even approach this day to night transition here with dynamic weather and lighting like this. NONE. Not even on PC. Again, Dirt 3 comes closest but it doesn't match the realism of the lighting and weather.

Cloud cover is scattershot in this game, leading to a lot of different shades and colors. The world basically reflects most everything accurately; it truly is the most realistic lighting environment in a racer. I amazed at all the trackside detail they put into this game time after time, though you do get a lot of lower res stuff if you look hard enough.

The world does seem more alive to me than most other games, and it is something that sticks with you. From flocks of flamingos and dusty roads in India, with some decent hilly areas, to the large and looming mountains in Norway where you can blast around with your super, I think it's at least fairly incredible that Evolution got all this down in the timeframe for this new gen.

As far as sound the game is unmatched in the engine department. All their hard work paid off very well with each car being very distinct. They have captured the engine ambiance, things other than the roar of the engine, better than anyone else PERIOD. You can hear the various engine components and their natural sounds in perfect working unison. Different camera views have different levels of audio, too.

In the end it comes down to preference. If you like an open world game, I recommend Forza Horizon 2, a really wonderful stab at that kind of game. The racing there isn't quite as addicting though and that isn't why I play FH2 at any rate. That game is all about exploration in a somewhat fantasy type of setting. The racing in DC is pure, down to the wire aggression and fun that exemplifies the spirit of circuit and P2P type racers. This is a definite buy if you are a fan of racers. If you are not sure then give it a shot on PS Plus when that version becomes available for free in the coming months.",The best racer of the last 5 years.,1412812800,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

5.0,True,"11 29, 2009",A3LGDXHXYBMGCY,B00269DXCK,drollere,"assassin's creed 2 is the brilliant culmination and synthesis of the current state of the art in videogames. relying on the bink and havok engines, with facial animation by impersonator, it does nothing that can't be done in other games (including assassin's creed 1). the genius and beauty in this game is specifically what it has chosen to adopt from other games, how it has improved on what it borrowed, and how it has woven the pieces together into a ""best of class"" entertainment.

the marketing hype has it that ubisoft ""listened to its users"" when writing the second game. that may be true for the marketers, but it's clear that the scriptwriters and engineers played other games, and borrowed from them:

* GRAND THEFT AUTO -- the style of visual narrative, with many cut scenes and the basic premise of the crime and punishment of conspiracy, feels very much like GTA 4. there are many side missions, each involving somewhat different tactical or technical challenges, as in GTA. and the landscape and atmospheric rendering is also very similar, including the full diurnal (day/night) cycle of light and the distinctive, somewhat darkened and overcontrasted color palette of niko's liberty city. even niko's pigeon hunt is here, sardonically replaced by a hunt not for 100 birds, but for 100 bird feathers.

* FABLE 2 -- many details small and large have been adapted from fable 2: in narrative, from the ""childhood"" origin of the story to the developmental and moral changes across adulthood, including changes in appearance, and the presence of thieves, whores, brigands and pickpockets, who form a dynamic part of the landscape; in the game play, from the ""timer"" mechanism used to extract wealth from hidden treasure chests and in the mechanism of the assassin's firearm. more, AS2 borrows the conceit of a village that the hero nurtures through property investment, the ""rents"" the hero receives as a result, the RB selector wheel that the hero uses to choose one or another weapon, the creepy setting of a swampy, half submerged landscape (in AS2, the area outside forl), and dank catacombs that contain game tokens and complex puzzles. omitted (thankfully) are the expressions or japes that the hero must perform in fable 2 in order to win friends and unlock secrets.

* OBLIVION -- finally, AS2 adapts the landscape sandbox from the oblivion games to give the romanga and tuscan cities a rural setting. although there isn't much to do out there but run around on side missions or treasure hunts. but free running over these fields provides a welcome contrast to the cramped environment of the early renaissance city.

the urban settings -- florence, forl, san gimignano, the walled auditore family villa in monteriggioni, and venice -- are beautifully realized, each with a separate palette of stone, light and architectural metaphors. though some landmarks (the piazza di san marco in particular) are delightfully realistic, the city layouts are only metaphors for the actual buildings of the era: the rialto fish market is here, but the gorgeous ca' d'oro just across from it is missing; the towers of san gimignano are not so closely spaced. even as 15th century settings, these cities will seem inaccurate to people who have actually been there. and while the history is highly fabricated and the conspiracy theory elaborately far fetched, it is nevertheless fun to have leonardo and machiavelli as side kicks and to assault the borgia pope. it's no exaggeration of history to say that he deserves it!

aside from all these theatrical improvements over the original AS, a major pleasure in this game is the wider range of physical (climbing and jumping) capabilities at ezio's disposal, and the much more complex combat moves and battle opponents. the fights are also more arduous and realistic (ezio's gnads take a lot of punishment), and the various ways in which enemies can be dispatched are unexpected. my favorite move was the ""disarm"" maneuver when fighting an enemy with bare hands: it's the most effective way to put down a ""brute"" or heavily armed solider, though difficult to pull off when other soldiers are also attacking.

puzzles play a large part in the storyline; searching for glyphs and the intellectual or combinatorial puzzles they create are necessary to unlock the video ""truth"" segments (which end up showing that adam and eve were actually creations of alien beings, with the illusion creating teutonic weapon of AS as the edenic apple); physical climbing and leaping puzzles, some of them under time pressure, are necessary to unlock the armor of altair -- very handy, as it provides full health and never needs repairs. these are not really taxing for an advanced gamer, though they may require several attempts to figure out.

in fact, one of the things that AS2 does right is judge the skill level of an accomplished gamer. there were a few places in GTA4 or in dead space where i bascially gave up on the game for a month because i had reached a task or side mission that i found impossible to complete. this does not happen in AS2. i ""died"" only about 30 times, which happened primarily from physical falls during climbing puzzles (and the game spawns you immediately in place again). puzzles have numerous saved checkpoints, so you do not (as in GTA4) have to rebuild the task from the beginning. though i was severely tested several times (the last assassin sarcophagus is a difficult physical puzzle), i got through most tasks on the first try, and the most difficult after two dozen or so attempts. the point is that, by carefully adjusting the task difficulty, the game acquires a cinematic flow and narrative power: when ezio dies you are not embroiled in doing an impossible chore, but in living a virtual life. to reinforce this flow the ""animus interruptus"" is drastically reduced: the abstergo plot is limited to brief opening and closing episodes and to just two interruptions of the fantasy narrative. this flow is perhaps the greatest attraction in the game.

there are many charms and innovations in this game that i haven't mentioned. but i will say that AS2 clearly reveals the biggest flaw in current videogame technology: the impersonator facial simulation. as advanced and impressive as that is as a motion capture and animation technology, there is something hideous and creepy in the glossy, cadaverous hues in which most faces are painted, the weirdly illuminated glints of teeth in the mouth, and the bizarre effect of looking up under a beard that seems to be a curved piece of cardboard. i did miss the honeyed light and floating flecks in the air that made AS an atmospheric experience, but it's the waxy animation of human speech and the plastic rendering of human skin that grates each time, every time, it swims onto the screen.",the assassin unleashed,1259452800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"02 4, 2015",A2868NX30GGTAM,B00SRZH210,Amazon Customer,"This is an episodic adventure game in the vein of Telltale's stuff, but with a couple of twists that distinguish it, at least with the first episode.  The first is that this is a collaboration between Square Enix(who seem to now like trying these games) and DONTNOD(the team that made Remember Me).  Like Telltale's games, Life Is Strange relies on storytelling and character choices to influence the events of the story.  The biggest deviation is the addition of a reversing time feature to the mix.  The most distinctive and best part of Remember Me in my view was the memory hacking sequences, and in Life Is Strange, the DONTNOD team decided to make an entire game around a similar mechanic.  You can reverse time to solve small puzzles within the game and to change your conversation choices.  Whenever you make an ""impactful"" decision, the game will let you know and you always have the option to make a different choice if you wish.  You can do this until you physically move on to the next event by your own choice, so there's no time pressure unlike a Telltale game.  However, once you move to the next event, your decision is locked in.  One of my criticisms of Telltale in their games is that the decisions you make ultimately don't seem that impactful and don't branch the story much.  It remains to be seen if this is also the case with Life Is Strange, but I get the sense that it will be a more branching story with the choices you make.  Also, unlike Telltale stuff of late, Life is Strange has a lot more exploration and optional ""quests"" you can find, at least throughout Episode 1.  Story-wise, the game is interesting to start, kind of reminding me of playing a bizarro episode of Daria.  The lead character, an 18 year old girl named Max, is returning to a small town where in an intense situation she discovers her time reversing capability and among other storylines discovers that there's a major town mystery involving a missing student at her school and the possibility of the town getting destroyed by a weird looking tornado.  Graphically the game has an appealing, almost painterly style, but doesn't have the best models or textures, so it's pretty much a case of art style over polygons as to whether you'll like it.  It has a good indie soundtrack when it comes into play at a few points.  Voice acting in the game is generally good with a few mediocre spots.  Dialogue is similarly good, but have a few streaks of annoying parts with some dated slang.  Overall if you like episodic adventure games, I highly recommend giving this a try, it's available for PS3, PS4, PC, 360, and Xbox One, there's a demo available, individual episodes are $4.99 and the full season pass is $19.99.",A great start to a new episodic series by the Remember Me team...,1423008000,25,,

Persona 5 features a confidant system where you can spend time with friends to increase your bond and unlock skills. It features a romance system and multiple choice responses which range from silly to serious. The persona system consist of capturing persona's through ridiculous dialogue and using them in battle. Persona's have unique abilities and can be fused with one another to create even stronger personas.

Also, Persona 5's story is very serious and uses real world events, such as abuse, rape, drug use, and much more. Making the story meaningful and dramatic. The main character is mostly mute the entire story, but that's no problem as the supporting cast has plenty of lines and they are voiced perfectly. Character design is perfect and the visuals are great as well. One of the best things in this game is it's music. I highly suggest you listen to the sound track.

The only con is the dead lines. You live in the real world and each activity you do passes time, even when it really shouldn't. With that free time you can level up confidants, attributes, or explore mementos (dungeons).

From the great graphics with very high detail to an awesome soundtrack, this game was better than Riven. I read one of the reviews that said he beat this game in one day. No way unless you used a cheat guide. A friend of mine totally ruined this game using the guide and it still took him 12-14 hours to beat the game doing it right the first time. So if it took him a month on the original Myst (It took me about 5 days), then he didn't beat this in one day. This game has many puzzles and they are difficult.
The basic story line is that the character you see the most, Saavedro, is upset with Artus's sons who have ruined his world, and blames Atrus for the death of his family. And you follow Saavedro through many ages solving puzzles along the way to try and restore those ages. The ages are as follows:
1. J'Nanin: This is where it all starts. The detail that went into this is quite awesome. Your goal here is to get into the 3 large tusks around the island. And that ain't easy.
2. Amateria: This is my favorite. From the rolling thunder and flickering lightning in background to the sunset on the other side, this age is awesome and alot of fun. You have 3 devices that you need to get to work, and once you do, clues are given to you to get into the last house. Once there, you have to solve the final puzzle which takes you on a very cool ride.
3. Edanna: This one I hated. There was very little light and the trails you were to follow were not very well marked. But what you had to do to solve the puzzles was very well done.
4. Voltaic: This was also a very cool age. This age had some of the most awesome scenic views in the game, plus a very cool ride you got to go on.
5. Narayan: A very small age. Not many places to go and the puzzles were alot easier than the rest were.
This game felt alot more like Myst than Riven did. Like in Myst, you went to one age and solved it and moved on to the next. If you got stuck, touch the linking book and you can try another age. Riven was a vast age and you may solve one puzzle on one island that worked for a different island. Just a mess trying to solve. The cutscenes are nothing special except for you when you solve a puzzle and some of them were great. But the scenery and music were awesome, and they keep adding more animation with each Myst game. The end scenarios (there are 3 or 4 different one) aren't anything special, but neither was Myst's ending. This is the game I had hoped Riven would be, and though I liked Riven, Myst III definitley captures that old familiar feel that Myst had.",A flashback for me.,1018310400,21,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

What made the Fallout games unique were not just its post-apocalyptic setting, but its character creation scheme - called S.P.E.C.I.A.L (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Ability and Luck). You get some totally hilarious perks - my favourite is Bloody Mess. I have many fond memories of scoring a critical hit with my sniper rifle and watching my target's head disintegrate in a glorious explosion of blood and gore.

My favourite aspect of the game (IMHO) were the incredibly strong storylines. ""War...war never changes..."". It's a powerful and evocative opening line. Junktown and Necropolis in Fallout 1. San Franciso in Fallout 2. Each and every city in both games had unique identities, and the stories, quests and characters developed naturally from those environments.

So if you see these wonderful games on your local game store shelf - for goodness sake, do yourself a favour and buy it now.

I am not used to JRPG games and honestly I don't like turn-based strategy games that much, but this game managed to attract me to it the the degree that I didn't turn of my PS4 until my controller went down from fully charged to nearly empty!

The game has a decent story so far as an anime-based game, also it has unique gameplay features that you could spend many hours into them instead of progressing through the story:

- You can improve your digimons in the farm with many strategies to do this.
- You can digivolve and de-digivolve your digimons which is an exciting and rewarding thing to do.
- You can fight other players online which is very fun if you have strong digimons.

Regarding the combat system, it's not simple unless you are fighting very weak digimons early on, but if you are fighting bosses or tough enemies later on you will definitely need to plan every move in order to win, and there are plenty of options regarding the fight aspect.

5.0,True,"01 7, 2015",A1F23MY8SB905X,B00NFXOQW2,Mitch,"A real step in the right direction with the next-generation of video gaming.  The Xbox One certainly fell flat on it's face after announcement and launch, but damn is it back up and running like Usain Bolt in the Olympics now!  There aren't any major problems I have with anything about the console, software, hardware, or otherwise.  Yes, I have complaints, but they are minor and pale in comparison to the positive features that the console has.  I'm also not sure why anyone would be buying the Xbox One w/ Kinect bundle that has no games.  Even if you don't like AC, why not at least get a console that comes with games, even if you aren't going to use them.  In fact, at the time of purchasing this one, the Xbox One w/ Kinect bundle and no games, was actually more expensive than this rendition of the console bundle.  Also, I understand if you don't have the money to afford the luxury that is the Kinect, but I really feel like the Xbox One just isn't itself without the counterpart.  Some may find it as a novelty item and that it cannot be useful in gaming and that the voice commands are just fluff and whatnot.  And then there's the tin-foil hat society, reeking their havoc all over the internet, convincing people that the Kinect is always watching and listening in on you and that Microsoft is recording that data and could be recording constant video and selling your information to private parties and whatnot.  First of all, if you're buying a Xbox One and plan to connect it to the internet in any way shape or form, your information is bound to be farmed, that is the unwritten privacy agreement of using the internet in the first place, is that of course putting your information in a virtual world that is accessible to the world is going end up having people see it.  After that rant, let's begin:

To prevent TL;DR issues, here's a quick summary:

PROS:
Kinect features (voice commands, recognition software, no motor)
Xbox One's low temperature from large powerful fans
Xbox One's completely silent operation
Xbox One's slot-loading (compared to disk tray loading)
Xbox One's Blu-Ray capabilities
Controller (everything about it)

CONS:
Xbox One's whirring power supply
Xbox One's small storage space
Xbox One's inability to sit vertically
Xbox One's size
No indicator as to how many controllers are in use and which controller is which player
No more green indicator lights on the Xbox or controller, they are now white
Must be connected to the internet to initially set up

If you want any detail regarding anything mentioned in the summary above, read on...

Kinect:
The Kinect is amazing.  The voice-commands make multi-tasking while using the console an absolute breeze.  You can start up the console, open up Netflix, search for a movie, select a movie, play a movie, then pause, rewind and fast-forward that movie, all without touching anything except the TV/TV remote.  For those concerned, you CAN make it so that the Kinect and console both SHUT DOWN when turning the console ""off.""  And if you're really paranoid, they sell Kinect privacy covers here on Amazon and in stores.  The Kinect has many abilities.  The microphone has been revamped massively, even so that in a Skype call, the other player cannot hear your game through the television, but can hear you when you speak.  It can recognize your heart-beat, every limb (including fingers and the direction of the limb facing the camera).  Instead of having a motorized base like the older Kinect, when in a Skype video call, the camera itself will follow you around the screen (it's software powered, not hardware, nothing moves) and will zoom in on you as you get further away from the screen.  Some games also chose to incorporate motion features, such as Battlefield 4.  They allow you to look around when in a vehicle using your head, as well as lean around corners in game, not to mention the voice-commands they included.  The Kinect also has the ability to sense who is in front of it, and will log all people with an Xbox account that are in front of it, in.

Console:
The console is obviously the meat and potatoes here.  The console itself is a large-sized VCR essentially in dimensions and even look, to some extent.  It is massive, but light.  This is due to Microsoft's due diligence regarding the past issues with overheating and cooling malfunctions on the Xbox 360 that led to the infamous Red Ring of Death error.  There are huge fans installed in this bad boy, and let me tell you, you wouldn't even know they were there.  When using the console it is whisper quiet, and if I mute the TV, I can't hear anything at all while it's running.  The satellite/cable feature is nice, but I don't use it since I don't have satellite/cable.  The only hardware complaint I have, is that the power brick for the Xbox One makes a whirring noise when on, and it happens to be the only thing I can hear when I mute the TV, as mentioned earlier.  The Xbox dashboard has been completely overhauled, some ways good, some ways bad.  They did make it much harder to get to where you want to go most of the time and some things are ridiculously hard to find on the console, but you'll get it all sorted out soon enough, like I did, I'm sure.  The only other console complaint I have, is that the 500GB hard drive space GOES FAST. VERY FAST.  You will run out of space before you hit 15 games for sure.  I have 5 I think, and I'm at 41% hard drive space usage.  Fortunately Microsoft is allowing users to attach external hard drives to the console and use them for storage, and I know at least a few 1TB drives that will work, so the problem is really moot, considering you can fix it fairly easily.  It also is required to sit horizontally now, however, it was NEVER a good idea to operate a console in a vertical position, even when it was a option.  There's also no more indicator on the controller/Xbox as to how many controllers are connected and as to which controllers are which players, and the green indication lights on the Console and the Guide button on the controller have been changed to white now.  You must also connect it to internet to use it. Period.  There's no getting around it, but once you set it up, you can take it off the internet and leave it off, if you like.

Controller:
The $2 billion that Microsoft poured into improving and modifying the Xbox 360 controller design and style and functionality, paid off well. The new controller is a home run for sure. The new triggers are heaven on your fingers, as you can now wrap them around the trigger and controller smoothly. The triggers also have very nice quality rumble motors in them individually, as well as a dampened/muted contact point when pulled all the way against the controller. An issue I am having with the triggers is that my right trigger squeaks occasionally when pulled toward to the controller, but that may be an isolated case and shouldn't be present on every one of them, so I wouldn't worry about that. The new buttons look great. They are every so slightly closer to each other on the controller layout, and seem slightly smaller in circumference, and have a more ""buttony"" feel when pressing them down, as they seem to have a slightly noticeable actuation point.

The bumper buttons are a decent improvement over the old controllers, however I do have a complaint in that they make much, much more noise than the old ones did. Be warned, they are very ""clicky."" The new battery pack housing is the second best improvement, as it now sits flush with the back of the controller and doesn't protrude as the old one did, which makes holding the controller much nicer. The start button and back button were replaced by the ""menu"" and ""view"" buttons, but they essentially function the same way as before when in most games. The Xbox ""guide"" button got flattened and moved up the controller on its own little section and now illuminates white instead of green, and does not show which controller number it is, nor is there an indication on the Xbox One itself either, which is a slight disappointment.

The analog sticks stayed the same distance from the controller I believe, however the actual part your thumbs go on got smaller, but the improved textured rubberized edging on them makes up for that because it allows for great grip on the sticks. However, I can imagine someone with bigger fingers having a problem using this controller's analog sticks. If you have this issue or are concerned about it, I would look into Kontrol Freek's analog extensions, as they may help. They seem to move and click pretty much the same as before, but I am noticing a slight wear in the left analog stick towards to front of the shaft from holding it upward/forward in games like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed. So far it is not impeding on anything, but a forewarning, in case it becomes further worn and becomes inoperable or impaired after a long period of extended daily usage.

The D-Pad has been improved as well, getting it's own little crater to reside in so that it is not so obtrusive from the face of the controller, and now makes a very distinct ""click"" when pressed, which is something I love dearly about the new controller, as I hated the completely muffled D-Pad buttons from previous controllers. Some may find it too loud or maybe slightly annoying, but I can't foresee anyone having a major issue with it.

All in all, the new controller definitely shines, and the $2 billion in research funding and tinkering definitely went to good use and will not go unnoticed. This controller should go down in history as the best ergonomic game pad created thus far, I feel.","Welcome, To The Next Generation In Gaming.",1420588800,,,

Maybe if they thought about it they might see that graffiti can be an art form expressed in a controlled environment (such as in a computer game like this- think about it.) Secondly, there are the young guys, usually in their early to late teens, who don't get the hyper-happy Japanese-style music and characters and would much prefer a more Americanised skating game complete with rock soundtrack. Both groups, while different, share the same wide-spread disease of conservatism that stifles creativity and results in identikit games clogging up videogame and music charts around the world. Jet Set Radio Future was the first wholly cel-shaded game when it came out on the Dreamcast so is, firstly, quite historically important. (Dragon's Lair is hardly a game in the modern sense.) The Xbox version has spruced it up graphically, made it a bit easier and cranked up the quirky tunes and characters. I put its failure saleswise squarely down to its Japanese sensibilities.

The graphics are very colorful and sophisticated.  I would definitely approve this for adults.  I think it is too sophisticated for anyone under 10 only because the items asked for would not be in their vocabulary yet. It seems to come out of Canada as one thing you search for is a Maple leaf every few levels.  The characters are fun, they move, and the garden is beautiful as you buy more for it. I read a review that a user was frustrated because there was not enough money to buy anything for the garden. You have to keep playing levels until you accumulate enough money.  The beginning offers items for the garden that cost only $100-300. This is easy to get, but as the levels progress things get a lot more expensive I also read one person said it was too easy and they prefer a stronger challenge. I like the level of challenge on this.  You have to find things on the list posted on the left side, take your mouse and slide over the picture to find things, then click on what you find and it disappears from the screen and the money is created to your account.  The wording is tricky.  For example, they will ask you to find five ""bows"". Well, most of us think of a bow as something wrapped around a present.  But the game gets tricky here because a bow can also be a bow and arrow, plus regular bows. The one negative that drives me nuts is the top part of the picture.  Many times it is black.  In order to add more light, you need to tilt your computer screen down to enable you to see the things at the top. So far, I have been working on this for 8 hours on and off, and as the game seems to come to an end, there is new one. I don't know how long this thing is, but you sure get your money's worth.

5.0,False,"01 6, 2009",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000P0XA4I,Cloud,"As I was leaving the store with ""Skate"", the new skateboarding franchise from EA, in my pocket, a thought occured to me: when was the last time I played a sports game anyway? I mean back in the old days, I used to play whatever: fighting, racing, sports, RPG's, movie tie-ins. And yet now it's mainly relegated to long adventures with twisty narratives and for some reason, I felt this urge to actually give ""Skate"" a go and though I find real skaters a bit annoying with their attempts at being as ""gangsta"" as possible and seeing how many times they can say ""yo"" in one sentenc, the game itself is actually quite fun though the learning curve is a bit steep but like the old saying goes: it's easy to play but harder to master though it's pretty sweet nailing that trick.

Story: After a hilarious live-action video, your character starts off and the basic premise really is just...skate. That explains the title I suppose since that seems to be the best thing to do and though there's challenges to take on and tutorials to lengthen your literal bag of tricks, the real goal of the game is just have fun and if you see a pipe or ledge then grind it. An obstacle then hop over it. Oh and look totally awesome while doing it.

Graphics: Like open world games like Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto and the like, the graphics are pretty good though if you're going for immense detail than that's usually found elsewhere since this game is all about the finer details. The skaters' faces look pretty well done though not Half-Life 2 or Mass Effect extraordinary but then their character animations during skating is spot-on. Cars and cities are pretty basic and interaction is minimal but then the wobbling of your tires and the wince-inducing crashes are excellent. Load times can be a problem for some though in my case (maybe because of this patch that popped up), they were pretty minimal.

Sound/Music: One thing I always hated about support character voices is the frequent clips they use since after awhile you feel like ""I know!"". One objective was to fliptrick into a manual (tilting the board front or back), staying that way than fliptricking out of it. Of course nailing it was tough enough but the other guy keep saying what I was supposed to be doing it's like you wanna slap the guy and say ""shut up, I'm trying here"". However, musically it's quite fun and who knew cruising to ""Raining Blood"" by Slayer would get you pumped for grinding the rails? There's many other tracks that popped up as well such as Nirvana's ""Lounge Act"" as well as a remix so that was quite cool. Again, voice clips are well done though repetitive but music's got no issues for me.

Gameplay: Instead of button presses a la Tony Hawk, ""Skate"" is controlled by using the Flickit system which moves your moves to the analog. To do an ollie/nollie or essentially a basic jump, push back or front than move it the other way. After awhile it's easy enough to use but I gotta say, with so many tricks, half the time I'd land some move I never heard of yet I was really trying to go for a basic heeljump or something. Speaking of which, the sensitivity on this is a bit too unforgiving at times; like going for a move that calls to push to the right or left (kickflip and heelflip) only the game interprets it as a rotate to the left or right, resulting in a pop shuv it. It's not enough to get annoyed at but more often than not, I couldn't nail a requirement because the stick movement was wrong and with a mini-game named ""S.K.A.T.E"" which is similar to H.O.R.S.E. or basically a Simon Says, trying to imitate a skater can be tricky.

The game's pretty free-reignas far as what you can do and new areas can be explored for more fun and a handy map works quite well. Music will dictate where most skaters are where you'll usually find a full on skating park with the big grooves and ramps to just simple parking lots with beams and ledges. One complaint is that outside of doing a flip trick or crashing, you're kind of glued to your board so if I want to do this awesome idea for a trick, I can't just walk up these stairs I tumbled down, I have to skate up these things, turn around and try again. Can't I just pick my board up, walk a few feet and give another go?

With sponsors, music tracks and of course the ever-popular achievements, there's plenty to do in Skate and even when you've done everything well hell, just go out there again and go for the fun of it which was a nice surprise. I haven't played a Tony Hawk game in years (one of the initial ones on the first Playstation is only attempt so far) but I don't think I'd go to that one after playing this.

Cons:  Play ends after so many turns, the historical stuff is cringe worthy, minor touch screen issues.

This is probably one of the best titles available on the Nintendo DS.  I've played it several times -- the replay value is very high because each time you play it, it is a different experience.  There are four different ways of winning.  You can win a Cultural Victory by obtaining a certain number Great Person, Wonders of the World, and converted enemy cities, a Technological Victory by obtaining a certain number of technologies, an Economic Victory by obtaining a certain amount of gold, or a Domination Victory by capturing enemy capitals.  There is a lot of strategy involved in which civilization you choose to be as well because the different civilizations have different advantages.  One civilization might start the game with a cathedral, giving them a cultural advantage, while another might start with stronger warriors, giving them a military advantage.  You can also play scenarios in which the game works differently -- for example a scenario in which barbarians are more aggressive or a scenario in which naval battles play a larger part.  The diversity of ways to play is probably this game's biggest advantage.

The game is a bit simplified from larger console versions, but this works well for a DS game.  Playing through a campaign typically last a couple of hours which means that you can pick up the game a play it in an afternoon.  The graphics aren't high end, but they serve their purpose well.  The menus all work well making micro-managing your civilization a breeze.

Occasionally, tapping on the touch screen isn't as precise as I'd like it, causing my troops to move in ways that I don't want them to move, but this doesn't happen often.  I have to admit, that my inner historian cringes when Chicago is sitting right next to London and Gandhi is talking to Alexander the Great, but I can see why they made the game this way and the attributes that are given to each civilization actually make sense.

This game's biggest problem is that if you haven't won in a certain number of turns, the game just ends.  I do not know why the game is made this way because given enough time, someone would invariably win.  It is very annoying to be playing and planning and then be told that the game will end in 5 turns.

This game makes you move your virtual life from Morrowind to the Imperial Province which is more similar to an earthly historical place.

Now that the sentimental stuff is out of the way on to the good stuff. The graphics are much, much better than Morrowind. My system isn't over the recommended settings but I still play smoothly by choosing my settings correctly and it looks very good. The models are much more detailed to the effect that you'll sometimes even gasp when you run into an attractive female who got her clothes stolen.

Sound is just as good as Morrowind and the main theme is a tribute to the Morrowind main theme. There are a lot of voices in this game and it is possible to not have to read any of the conversions and just listen to the NPCs. You can thankfully skip over lines that you don't want to hear if you are a fast reader. Just like Morrowind you can also add new songs to the music folder if you want to use a custom soundtrack.

Control is improved. Blocking is so much better that even if you aren't a warrior you can hold your own in melee against the common enemies. The new magic casting does take some getting used to and so does the unified menus. Controls do feel more like a console game and Oblivion's battles are a lot more action based than Morrowind's.

As for gameplay, most of the changes are for the better. The cities were improved seemingly using a Gothic 2 like model. It seems to me they also took hunting and the ""radiant AI"" from playing that game. It fits TES very nicely. Enemies level up now so leveling up the wrong skills may get you into trouble at the higher levels but so far it hasn't bothered me. Trading is different and I'm not sure it's improved that much. Lockpicking gives you the option to do a minigame but you can also do it the Morrowind way. Speechcraft is thankfully much more improved. Stealing is also more elaborate. Steal from a store and hang around and the guards will come looking for you even if nobody actually saw you stealing. The missions are now more elaborate and even the most trivial ones may surprise you with some funny, emotional and even sensual topics. Travel is different with no more stilt riders, boats or guild guides. Now you have a horse option (they actually fight too!) and a fast travel option to places you've been to before or major sites you haven't been to yet.

But in the end this is still TES. All you're old Morrowind tricks like repairing bound armor, shooting arrows while levitating, beating people to a pulp with your bare hands and gaining magicka by fighting your own creatures is still possible. On a personal note I'm glad the Atronach birthsign now gives you 50% spell absortion along with stunted magicka.

If you liked Morrowind you'll most likely like this one as well. Players who were put off by Morrowind's low level combat should try Oblivion. Players who traditionally don' like deep RPGs should give it a chance. Like hack and slash games? Create a stereotypical warrior and join the fighters guild. Like stealth games? Create a stereotypical thief and join the thieves guild. You may just like it enough to try out new things.",Excellent but I still miss Morrowind,1162944000,3,,
5.0,False,"06 3, 2008",A22AD8M2SSOFHJ,B0016QCCFS,A. C. Ege/Acedoh,"I have to admit I have been a skeptic of the Singstar franchise. With game after game on the PS2 it didn't really anything I was ever interested in. Now with it's new life on the PS3 it is a whole other game. Singstar is without a doubt the best party game available right now on the PS3. It is also a prime example of how much fun community gaming can be.

From the minute you pop the disc in it's simple to navigate the menu. You esentially have three options. Play Singstar, view gallery, and online. I am going to cover each option so that you can understand how much fun this game is.

Playing Singstar gives you a choice of thirty songs to croon over. The thirty songs are a mix of pop, r&b, and rock. Sorry country fans, your not going to find any of your favorite songs on this disc. Although you only get 30 songs to chooose from there are well over 200 available on the Singstore. More on that later. Now with Singstar you can just have a solo performance or if you have your friends around there are plenty more options. You can actually have contests with up to eight people. The possibilities are really endless. With multiplayer you can either perform a duet or battle others. There are specific songs for duet although every song will let you perform a duet. With a battle you can take on others to try and get the highest score. With the performances they are scored on a scale of 0 to 10,000. There are also difficulty levels if you want more of a challenge. The object is rather simple: Sing at the same tone as the artists. As you sing you really have to make sure you can keep the same level as the musician. On easy it's rather simple to get a good score. Upping the difficulty level makes it that much more difficult. What makes the performances memorable is that you can record your vocals. Now if your voice is or isn't very good you can adjust microphone level. What makes Singstar magic is having a USB camera that is compatible with the PS3 or a PS Eye. The camera will record a 25 second video of you belting out your greatest. You can even take the artists voice out of the songs. Of course I wouldn't advise anyone to do this unless they have a good voice. Now the audio clips, videos, and even snapshots the camera will take go into your gallery.

Now the gallery is what stores your best or worst performances. From here you can let other people see your performance at home. The gallery will store numerous videos, audio clips, and pics. What makes the gallery truly a gallery is that you can upload any of these things online to the Singstar interface.

Online is what takes this game to the next level. The Singstore is what the PSN should be. Immediately you get to choose from over 200 more songs that are available in the store. Each song sells for $1.49 and comes with the video. Not a bad price for some good fun. The Singstore will update with songs every other week. SONY is promising 25 to 50 songs a month. The artists cover a wide array of music genres dating back to the 1960's to songs that have just been released. I have already found myself downloading numerous songs I enjoy. The new music will keep this game fresh for quite a few months if not years.

The most amazing feature is the Singstar Online feature. From the main menu you can set up your profile listing your favorite song and musician. You can also have a picture taken from your USB camera. From your profile you can also view messages people leave you and check your uploaded videos to see if people are giving you good scores. You can also access other players. Set up like Youtube you can watch players from all around the world perform their best. The interface allows you to watch videos that have just been uploaded. You can also check out featured performances for the week. These are the higher scoring songs. And lastly they have a hall of fame featuring the highest rated most viewed performances. You can score any performance from 1 to 5 stars and even leave comments to the performer. If you really like someones performance there is an easy way to access your friends list and mailbox and request a person to be on your friends list. I have seen some stellar performances and I have also seen your very creative performance. This is a definite incentive to try and make something interesting for everyone to see. All in all this is what I enjoy most about the game.

If I were to sum up Singstar I would say it's an experience everyone should try. It's fun, a lot of fun. It's a great break from other gaming experiences and it's a good way to invite people over to do some karoke. I think that most who enjoy to sing in the shower or car should purchase this game. Those who have enjoyed it on the PS2 should enjoy it even more on the PS3. Have fun and try to become a Singstar...",Singing has never been so much fun...,1212451200,6,,

The effect is, that as I move backwards, I get to see the beginnings of the ideas that later come to fruition.  Since this series is noted for the originality of each issue, it is the little common themes, like Chocobos and wizard hats that make the entirety something magical.  And here is where they all began.
Of course, Final Fantasy I itself is derivative.  All long time PC and Atari gamers remember the beginnings of Origin Systems' Avater series with starry eyes.  Little characters dancing about a world map, asking questions, falling into dungeons, and saving the world.  When FFI first booted up I had a massive nostagia moment - the structural similarities are unmistakeable.  Even so, FFI is unique in world concept and plot, improving on the formula enough to be an instant success and rescue a game vendor from impending bankruptcy.  While it is primitive in many ways, it started an RPG revolution for the game console world.
From a production viewpoint, FFII is head and shoulders above FFI.  The artwork is much more detailed.  To the point that some of the monsters and background scenes are quite remarkable, and several of the characters actually have something that resembles a personality.  The downside of ths is that the world is a bit smaller, and the story a bit shorter - but not in any harmful sense.  While I think the FFI is probably the better game, FFII is really the first clear hint of what was to come as the series developed.  And it helped to create the momentum behind one of the most successful franchises in gaming.
What Squaresoft did in repackaging these games is revise the graphic, especially the CGI cut scenes, and rework the music.  In addition several new freatures - a bestiary and a collection of Amano Yoshitaka's original are for the series.  This is one of the best jobs of resurrecting something old and making it as much fun as it was originally that I have ever seen.

Nintendo Wii U runs games in huge action scenes or small rooms at a solid, outstanding, sharp colorful unbreaking 60FPS at 1080P.  This is something the Playstation, and Xbox 360 never did. (note - not every developer takes their time to learn the secrets behind the consoles power).  One rule is clear at this point in the game though, Japanese companies at least like Capcom, and 100% of all Nintendo games released thus far have the best looking graphics any console has ever been able to pull off.

Original Xbox Live was shut down so now it can only be played on system link. Good luck finding other people who own this controller!
You can get the controller to work with PC evidently, although the right joystick (which is pretty inconsistently stiff, and not because it's old/used) does not recenter itself because the game is designed around a crosshair that moves across the screen and stays there for aiming. That works well for MechWarrior 3, which can play like that, but not any other PC games I can think of. There is a smaller thumbstick on the left joystick that does recenter itself.
All the buttons light up and fade in and out and it looks awesome. The controller is very sturdy and seems like something that should probably cost more. Luckily, the game itself is great. It sure would suck if it was no good. I'm not sure how much depth or replayability the game has because I haven't beaten it. I hear the game gets way harder which is a scary thought.

This juxtaposition between color and black & white is something most big games wouldn't gamble on, but I think it only adds to this game. The list goes on and on.

Sure the story is over-the-top, but which games/movies aren't anymore? And sure, it has a few minute problems every here and there, but all in all, this game is one of the most fun games I've ever played. The protagonists are likable, the antagonists are hatable.

A lot of which you can create yourself. Customize the rules, amount of stock, time limits, character outfits, etc. Just let your imagination run free and battle. It's very fun collecting all of those trophies and wondering where and when you can get the next one. Some you have to battle over, some of them you find in Adventure Mode, and a lot you win after completing certain modes. What's more is that you also can unlock many excellent stages to battle on and unlock the sound test to listen to your favorite songs.

There's lots to do in SSBM and you won't get bored easily.

One thing I never cared for are the tiers. For example, I can easily play as Ganondorf in both games. To me, tiers are nothing but opinions.

What makes this game my favorite over Brawl is that the fighting is faster and the characters' powers are more balanced. There's not many cheap moves you can pull easily like in Brawl with its overpowered newer characters. They've also removed and weakened a lot of characters which everyone is aware of.

I do like the new animations and moves added though. For example, Ganondorf's Warlock Punch is no longer a direct copy of Falcon Punch. Though he's still a partial clone of C. Falcon and Samus. Link's boomerang calls forth a tornado, etc.

Though I do like a lot of characters in Brawl like King Dedede, Wolf, Pit, Meta Knight, Pokemon Trainer and Sonic. (I also prefer Brawl's TLP Ganondorf over Melee's OoT Ganondorf. I use both versions equally though.)

5.0,False,"03 7, 2008",A36L1OMNX0PMDQ,B000P46NMA,Matt Smith,"Assassin's Creed is one of the most unique games ever created. Assassin's Creed is interesting because it takes place in the Holy Land during the Crusades. You play as Assassin Altier, an assassin during the Crusades. You are part of an organization called the Assassin's Creed. The Creed is a list of laws that you must follow.
 1. don't harm an innocent. (you can kill a random civilion, but you lose health.)
 2. Hide in plain sight. (hide by disguising yourself as a civilion, strike, and hide again. Never let anybody find you.)
 3. Never dishonor the Creed. (keep the brotherhood safe and don't break the first two laws)

 Assassin's Creed plays out like a movie. In the beginning of the game, a bartender named Desmond is kidnapped in the modern world by a scientist. The scientist sticks Desmond in a machine that reveals the memories of our ancestors. Sure enough, Altier is Desmond's ancestor.
 Once the game goes back in time, there is an extremely long cutscene that shows how Altier breaks the Creed. After that, Altier is thrust into a warzone as he defends his town from Crusaders. Once that is over, there is another really long cutscene that shows Altier's master killing Altier. Altier comes back to life however. (You understand how at the end of the game.)
 In order for Altier to stay as an assassin, he must complete his training again. After he completes training, he is charged with killing nine important leaders in an attempt to end the Crusades.
 This is where you come in. After this part, everything is handed over to you. You can ride into any city and assassinate the leaders in any order you like. (the first mission is always the same though. You have to assassinate one of the men first before you can move on to the free world gameplay.)
 However you take out your targets is up to you. You can come up behind them and drive a dagger in their neck, you can throw knives at them, or you can come in with your sword swinging.
 Each one of the missions gets harder and harder, until they are almost impossable. The ending is very confusing and doesn't offer much of a closer. BUT!, the game leaves a huge opening for a sequel.
 There are several other missions that you can preform. Sometimes you have to sit on a bench and evesdrop, or pickpocket delivery men. Other times, you just have to beat the information out of your target. (And then kill him.) You can also go around and save citizens being pushed around by guards. There are also a certain number of flags in every level that you can go around collecting. You can also climb buildings and towers to get your surrondings and find out where your target is. (Everything is Asssassin's Creed is extremlely natural. Nothing looks as though you could climb it. You just happen to be able to.) Lastly, my personal favorate, you can go around and assassinate Templar soldiers who set up their own camp in random places around the city and try to kill you if they see you. (They are kind of anti assassin assassins.)

Assassin's Creed is one of the best games ever created and you will remember it for years to come.

The thing that I love about this game is it's variety, you even have two story modes, both featuring there own set of levels! The two story modes, Hero (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles) and Dark (Shadow, Robotnik, Rouge), also provide a different perspective on the same story, which helps in understanding it. This game has three types of stages, the Sonic/Shadow stages are pretty much the 3-D version of the classic Sonic action that practically all gamers are familiar with. The Tails/Robotnik stages are third-person shooters, lock on to multiple enemies to gain extra points. The Knuckles/Rouge stages are ""treasure hunting"" challenges, and some of the harder ones are just that, challenging (and annoying if you get stuck on them for two long). Follow the radar at the bottom of the screen as it changes from green (cold) to red (hot) to find the peices of the master emerald. Each story also features a driving mini game. There are also a variety of engaging boss battles and once you finish both story modes, a ""Last Story"" opens with one ultra hard stage where you'll have to use all characters (except Shadow who does the first of the two consective final battles afterwards). There is also a chao mode where you can raise these virtual pets. You can alter their looks and abilitys with the small animals and chaos drives (crayons) you find in the stages.

5.0,False,"10 28, 2008",A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B0016BVYDY,NeuroSplicer,"I am old enough to have played the original game when it first came out in 1997. I was a great fan of the series that followed and, thus, was very eager to get my hands on this latest installment. In a short sentence: FALLOUT-3 is A DREAM COME TRUE!

It is a cRPG game in which the player can alternate between the First and Third person perspective roaming a world comparable in size with OBLIVION. The action has moved from Vault 13 and Southern California to Vault 101 and Washington, D.C. and the story brakes away from the previous bloodlines. However, the atmosphere of the original has been maintained and its scents sharpened: veterans will find it fitting like and old glove - whereas the new gamers are in store for a bag of pleasant surprises.

The graphics are wonderful, the guns detailed and the environments highly interactive. Short of a screenshot, imagine what would HalfLife-2 would look if released today. And similar to HL2, FALLOUT-3 does not require an...ubercomputer to run smoothly. Once you see a NPC move though, you understand where the corners were cut.

Character customization is carried out in great style using the new and improved PIP-BOY at the beginning. You exit the vault and the harsh reality of a world that barely survived annihilation slaps you on the face. Adapt or perish.

The main storyline is there to be followed but FALLOUT-3 offers the greatest number of alternative choices I have ever encountered in a game! There is always a great number of paths to follow in order to achieve any goal - but every choice comes with a consequences tag. This is common feature of most classic cRPGs but in FALLOUT-3 I saw it implemented like never before. If nothing else, this sends replayability through the roof.

Side-quests offer little besides distraction and experience points (XP) to be spend on character improvement. XP are gained solely by completing quests, emerging victorious from fights, finding locations, picking locks and hacking terminals - and they are not limited by the action they were earned. Leveling up is based on 7 basic attributes [Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility & Luck - acronym?;)] that, in turn, affect your (13) specific skills. Since leveling up is capped at Level-20, the game designers wanted to encourage replaying the game. On the other hand, it also means that your character will never realize its full potential (in case you are wondering why I withheld a star from FUN, that's the second half of it).

The game is violent and gory but well within tasteful limits. Not so with the language - but it is tradeoff with realism. In a radioactive world, Sunday-school niceties are bound to go out the window.
What deserves a special mention is V.A.T.S. (:Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) which opens new vistas in cRPG design. It is an ingenious system which lets you pause the game and target specific body parts of your opponents. The success of your attack still depends on your skills but the end effect is cinematic and amazing (remember SWORDFISH?).

After the nuclear summer of 2008 (with all the LimitedInstallation-defective EA releases), this seems like a postapocalyptic dawn indeed! BETHESDA decided to listen to the gaming community and did NOT cripple this beautiful game with any idiotic DRM scheme. Inputting a serial number and a DVD-check is more than reasonable.
The publishers of FALLOUT-3 understand that there is a fine balance between ""protecting the product"" and...""insulting your own customers"". And they obviously view respect as the two way street that it is - and for this they deserve our support: buy this game, today.

Voting with our wallets is the only argument the gaming industry cannot afford to ignore. And it is about time to cast some well deserved positive votes.

 You have 2 fully clickable analog sticks L1 and R1 along with L2 and R2 a dpad, start and select and 4 face buttons.

There are some diffrences between the 2 the pro version is basically a Xbox 360 controller with just enough diffrences to make it not violate copyright laws for your phone and it's great to have if you play games on your tablet or at home a lot.

I have the hero power which is a lot slimmer and more portable a way a controller for a phone should be However the buttons are smaller so if you have large hands you May want the pro controller it depends on personally preference The layout on each controller is the same along with the buttons.

There are 2 modes on the controller which is on the bottom there is the A mode which is Moga enhanced and there is the bmode which is useually for games that need button mapping such as emulators. A mode only works for a hand full of games best example being Modern combat which makes it feel like your actually playing a console version of call of duty.

It's an NISA game with late PS2 graphics. The graphics are only that way because of the shading that the game uses. Besides, if you're one of those gamers that can't play a game if the graphics ""aren't GREAT"", then go to FF13. Back to the review. The story starts you off in a fight against some ogres. Nothing crazy or anything, just something to get you familiar with the unique battle system. You hit certain body parts of the monster to ""mark"" them, then you can attack the marked parts with magic or, just continue to physically attack them. After the initial fight, you're introduced to most of the main characters of the game and, the story livens from there.

It's a VERY different type of RPG with a good story and good amount of fighting. You're also playing as two characters at once, from what happens early on in the story. This game got some pretty bad scores simply because people only wanted to look at the negatives instead of taking their time with this good RPG.

5.0,False,"01 30, 2012",A7HDIBPWU66SR,B00542ZQJO,new Tron,"When I finished playing Demon's Souls back in 2010, I wrote in my review that it was my favorite game of the current console generation, and that still holds true today.  The game was a truly unique and innovative RPG in a generation that, despite being full of many great games, isn't going to be remembered so much for its innovations in game design.  So obviously, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on Dark Souls, the game the developers have touted as the ""spiritual successor"" to Demon's Souls.  After putting nearly 90 hours into the game, I can say that Dark Souls is every bit as good as the masterful Demon's Souls.  Dark Souls has made some key changes to the design of the previous game, yet at the same time maintained, and even refined, all the characteristics that not only made Demon's Souls such a great game, but also, a breath of fresh air.

The biggest change Dark Souls brings to the fold is the introduction of a singular, interconnected game world.  Not so much an ""open world"" like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption, but more so a series of fully explorable areas that are connected by at least one passage (think Super Metroid).  This gives the game world a much greater sense of not only mystery, but dread as well.  Where as Demon's Souls gave you much more guidance by providing a peaceful hub world leading to the separate areas of the game, Dark Souls drops you into the middle of its world without any sense of where you are supposed to go.  You will receive vague hints from NPCs, but it's up to you to find your way around, and this makes you feel not only more isolated, but also makes achievement even more satisfying.  As you learn your way around, you'll slowly begin to see how the world is interconnected, and you'll marvel at the absolute genius behind the design of the world (which manages even to trump its predecessor in level design).  The same dark, dreadful and isolating vibe that oozed from Demon's Souls levels remains here, and is amplified by the sense of scale you get from this world.  Atmosphere plays such a dominant role in this game; Dark Soul's atmosphere is so thick that it is basically an ever-present character in the world, continuously following you around.

A key change also comes in a more forgiving checkpoint system, represented by various bonfires that can be lit and serve as not only as a place to rest and replenish, but to upgrade & repair weapons and armor, manage your inventory, and eventually, warp to different bonfires you've previously visited.  I found this to be a much smarter design than the ""start from the beginning"" method employed by its predecessor.

Despite these changes, Dark Souls remains one of the purest, most challenging, and most enjoyable games to be released this console generation.  The combat remains among the finest of any game ever made, demanding patience, practice and cunning from the player.  Your enemies remain fierce, intimidating, and sometimes terrifying.  The different types of weapons, armors and items, as well as they ways they can be upgraded, has exponentially increased over what was offered in Demon's Souls.  The multiplayer component, where hints from other players can be left in your game world, where partners can be summoned to aid in battle, and where you can invade another's game or be invaded yourself, has been given a new dimension of depth with the ability to join Covenants.  And the boss battles are still the most epic and sinister of any other games out there.  From Software, the developers, have successfully kept what worked in the first game, made changes where it counts, and still turned everything on its head with the newly structured world.  The game feels familiar, yet fresh.  Fans of Demon's Souls will be pleased.  For first-timers with the right amount of fortitude, Dark Souls will be a revelation.

Demon's Souls is still my favorite game of this console generation.  I'll never forget the first time I stepped into the imposing world of that game, and how I slowly realized that the developers were quietly revolutionizing the RPG genre.  Yet despite this, I can still say that Dark Souls is the better game of the two.  It feels less fragmented, more masterfully crafted, and most importantly, more fully realized.  This is a game that is retaining the essence of the hardcore RPG experience while setting itself apart from its contemporaries by combining brilliant design with stellar gameplay to create an experience that simply isn't being matched by anyone else.  Dark Souls is another masterpiece from From Software, a developer who is daring to be different by reaching further than most others would dare, and is striking gold by doing so.  RPG fans would be doing themselves a disservice by missing this game.

A NOTE ON THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION:  I ordered this version of the game, and I'm glad I did.  The metal case is very handsome, and comes in a hard plastic slip case to protect it.  A code that can be redeemed for a downloadable strategy guide is included, although I didn't use this, as I don't like to play games using guides.  Best of all is the hard cover art book, which features drawings and paintings of most of the game's enemies and bosses.  The creature design in Dark Souls is really stellar, and having this book is a treasure for big fans of the game.  Overall, I feel this edition was well worth the $59.95 I paid.","A true ""spiritual successor"" and one of the best RPGs you'll ever play",1327881600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I thought about getting it (I had the money), but I committed myself to never trust Sega. I took Sony's side and bowed to stick to Sony. When the Dreamcast dropped in price for $... I decided to buy one because of the great 2D fighting games which are unavailable on PS2 or are poor attempts on PS1. I bought the Sonic Bundle for $... and stocked up on VMU's and bought an extra controller. I bought all the fighting games I could get: King of Fighters DM 99, Virtua Fighter 3tb, Marvel vs Capcom 2, Capcom vs SNK, and ordered SF 3: 3rd Strike. I also bought Jet Grind Radio and Resident Evil Code Veronica. All I have to say is this: I was wrong for not giving SEga another chance.

I bought Order Up for my wife as a birthday gift.  I feel bad that three days later, she's logged about 45 minutes at the controls, and I've beaten the game at 5 hours, 59 minutes in.

The game is simply that addictive.  From the first burger you make until the last visit from the food critic at ""Chez Haute"" restaurant, you will not want to put this game down.

Your first reaction might be to think that at 6 hours, this game is very short.  This isn't untrue, but this is a game that better rewards the casual player.  In my course through the game, I served less than 10 ""non-perfect"" dishes.  I refused to serve ""good"" food, and instead would throw food away multiple times until earning a ""perfect"" score.  Also, by mastering the art of spicing (which is clearly defined within the game) I was able to generate upwards of $200 per table served, and would end a ""work day"" with over $800 in the bank.  Because of this I was easily able to keep my spices stocked, hire the best employees, and upgrade my kitchen very quickly.  As a result I made money very fast, and progressed through the game with lightning speed.  My wife on the other hand is not nearly as perfectionist, and is satisfied with serving Good or OK dishes.  This can end up making for a longer play through the game.  I say this as a good thing though - this game will entertain her much longer than it did myself.

Many reviews from gaming sites gave less than satisfactory remarks on the controls, saying that everything except folding burritos or omelettes worked well.  This is simply not true.  Every motion with the Wii control can be easily learned and skillfully mastered.  From flipping steaks to cutting swordfish to tearing lettuce to folding crepes - I could earn perfect every time.  Speed is the key, and some careful precision ""aiming"" with the remote helps.  Also, note that in the instruction manual it states that the ""nunchuk"" attachment is not needed, but adds some redundant controls to ease gameplay.  THIS IS VERY TRUE!!  The control stick on the nunchuck offers quicker ability to scroll through your cooking stations instead of having to leave the 'A' button on the remote and reaching the D-pad.  With the nunchuk connected, I drastically reduced my meal prep times.  I could serve a four-guest table in less than 2 minutes.

What makes this game so much more fun is that you are responsible for running a business.  At the start of every day it's up to you on how to spend the wares of the previous day.  You may want to unlock some new dishes, hire a new assistant cook (you have a limit of two,) purchase the recipe for exclusive ""chef's specials,"" or - and this was always important - stock up on spices.  You could also upgrade various aspects of your kitchen, making appliances work quicker, making grills and stoves cook faster, or even make you knives sharper.  In some regards this made the game more challenging because it's harder to juggle three cooking stations when they all cook faster!  In the end, you spent nearly as much time outside of the restaurant as you did inside, and both areas were equally entertaining.

I will agree with others that the game could have used more depth and length.  Another restaurant or two would have been nice.  A two-player mode would have been fantastic.  I personally would have liked to see more ""mature"" patrons at the nicer resturants - I got tired of the guy wearing a soup-can hat and farting on my surf-and-turf dinner...  The only real dissapointing part I felt was the ""delivery guy"" who could bring you super fresh meat or seafood, or fresh, ""organic"" vegetables.  The downside was you had to pay $1 to call the delivery guy, then when he showed up, had to pay upwards of $10 to pull a slot-machine handle built into his delivery truck, only to not win anything at all for your troubles!!  After this happened 5 times in a row, I never called the guy again.  There should have been a better reward system implemented to make this work.  But obviously it wasn't needed to enjoy or complete the game.  Lastly, I could not earn a perfect score on my pizza because the game wanted you to place pepperoni in some perfect pattern without any clear explanation.  That, as a perfectionist, simply drove me crazy.  Luckily I cooked all of 4 or 5 pizzas through the entire game.

Order Up was a very enjoyable experience that I look forward to continue playing even after I have beaten the game.  I think that in itself says all that needs to be said.  Serve me up another!",The Most Addictive Wii Game to Date,1218412800,94,,

You play a young man whose grandfather has died and left him his run-down farm to revive. There are tons of chores to do, animals to raise, vegetables to harvest, people to visit, girls to marry, Spring Festivals, Horse Races, swimming contests and much much more. There's always money to make and things to buy that can improve your house, farm or love life.
After 3 years, the man's parents come to rate how he's done, depending on how well the farm is doing. There are 4 seasons, each consisting of 30 days. There are 120 days in a Harvest Moon year, and around 5 minutes in each day. As the seasons change the events, vegetables, scenery and people's dialogues change as well. There are new events every year.
One thing that is pretty amazing is that this game is entirely free of violence, blood, or action, yet it's fun for all ages. It's good for kids because it is peaceful and non-violent, and makes them use strategy and helps them calculate time. It's good for older people too because it is challenging and there are many surprises to keep you coming back for more. This game has a very high replay value, because each time you play it it is completely different (you can marry 5 different girls, and depending on which one you persue, the game changes a lot). The absense of action & fighting makes it easier to concentrate on strategy. The graphics aren't great, but personally I don't mind-- the animals and people are really cute and chunky, and the controls are easy to master.
I would recommend Harvest Moon 64 to people of all ages. It's addictive, challenging, and it makes something that looks pretty dull into a really, really fun game.",Harvest  Moon 64 -- it's fun for everyone,979516800,21,,

Right of the bat, I must say I love the music, at times I leave the city running and growing on the slow speed, just so that I can listen to the jazzy cool tunes. I have been a fan of anything that has to do with the Sims since I was in 7th grade when I discovered Sim City 2000 on a computer in my computer class, yes in 7th grade. I'm almost 25 now and I am still crazy about the Maxis ideology behind the city games, as this grew and evolved into a marvelous game. I seriously don't know how they can improve this, because the graphics are phenomenal, you get to sculpt your land, and you can seriously choose from a whole globe of land to play on. You can plant your trees and wild animals, and then the zones, buildings, the natural disasters, the people who need you, your taxes, community programs, ordinances, and really fun decisions on where to plop your park, and this time you can choose from a huge variety of building and entertainment centers for your Sims.

I this game takes a bit to get used to and figure out how to play wile actually making money instead of spending them, and they sure give you enough at the beginning, and while you can Google for cheat codes, it's really fun to roll up my sleeves and really get my brain pumping while I manage my city. I love how many things I can be in charge of, the style of the buildings, where I want a farm with fruitful trees and orchards, what neighborhood I want the bus to stop in, what schools and museums I want resting in the shade provided by so many kinds of tress I can choose from, and so on.

I love this as it's a game you can play forever, I wonder how old I can grow my city to be and how I can sculpt it to perfection.

5.0,False,"08 11, 2009",A318TVGEWZR3G9,B000ZK7ZOE,D. Corning,"First, the reviews of this game are correct, check [...], the game is great. The animations are top notch and the gameplay is fast paced. The ememy AI offers up a good bit of variety and the story is straight forward and very well paced throughtout. The graoghic novel cut scenes look amazing. My only problem with it is that there aren't that many of them in the game. Overall the game is easily the best game of the summer that I've played. (Infamous, prototpye, etc.)

I actually waited to write this review, because the game has been compared to another game called ""Prototype"". It is safe to say that they are completely different games. I'll make it simple, Infamous plays more like a shooter and Prototype plays like a brawler and frankly dosen't pull it off well.

I agree with IGN's review of the game, 9.2 out of 10. The game isn't perfect but its much better than the compettiton. IGN gave prototype 7.5 out of 10 and that was being generous in my opinion.  Infamous has frame rate problems here and there, but not often, the most obvious being the pop in problems during the electric grinding move cole can do on the train tracks. (Trust me its obvious.)

Concerning the complaints of the side missions becoming repetitive, I agree and disagree at the same time. This game has its fair share of side missions and some like the reviews say are either repetetive or just stupid. My answer is ... I wish they were more specific. The only one I found stupid and repetitive was surveillance, where you had to zap some survallince equipment off of a building. This I guess is the one many people were complaining about, granted it was annoying and stupid, but dosen't bring the game down as a whole.

SPOILER!!

As I said in the title, this game has the makings of a fantasic franchise and I did mean that the character has the makings of an icon. Cole is an average guy working a lousy dead end job as a delivery boy and one day his package explodes destroying a large portion of the city.  He wakes up in a crater and escapes the diasaster and falls into a coma.  When he wakes up, he's been given super powers and now he must decide the morality in which he will use them, meaning use them for the good of the people or his own selfish desires.

If you have a PS3 go ahead and buy this game and if possible do so on Amazon, because they're selling the game $8 less than Gamestop and other retailers.",A franchise is made and an icon is born!,1249948800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I am honestly intrigued why anyone might opt for something else (no this is not an invitation for all the 360 trolls to crawl out from under the rocks and start spitting stink-venom, the 360 has value in it's own right too.) But the PS3 really does, DO IT ALL.

-Blu-ray - You get one of THE BEST Blu-ray players around. I also own the top rated Samsung 3D Blu-ray player that gets applause for its lightning fast load times. My PS3 was nearly the exact same speed in my side-by-side comparison. It is also a future proof Blu-ray player with it's 3D capabilities.

-320gb Storage - THE most storage available from any OEM console. I have my entire MP3 library on here and it streams perfectly to my surround sound system. I've set up playlists for all occasions and it really rocks the house. I also have 5 HD movies that I love to watch and rewatch saved on here. Given that I don't really REwatch stuff mutch, I probably will only save my favorites but I am sure to have enough space.

-Video Apps - Hulu Plus and Netflix are both so extremely robust I have actually cancelled my cable. They both stream in HD through the PS3 and look beautiful.

-Best Exclusive Game Titles - Between the Killzone, Uncharted, MLB The Show, Gran Turismo, Little Big Planet, Mod Nation Racers and Infamous series you can't go wrong. It has all the same cross-platform titles as the rest but these exclusives look absolutely stunning. There is no question, that a game designed for the PS3 looks like the most amazing thing in console gaming to date.

Motion Controller - I was skeptical about this. I have a Wii. It's fun enough, but it's a Wii and they games are well, dull. This is amazing. I cannot get enough of Ping Pong and the Gladiators game in Sports Champions. The 1 to 1 tracking works exactly as promised. The motion controller even operates the XMB (cross media bar, the main menu.)

Pandora - Yes, the PS3 web browser will go to [...] and stream your stations through your surround sound. I'm listening to ""my"" station right now.

Hands down, this is the best home entertainment value around. It has games for everyone in the house including little ones, teenagers and games for more mature folks. It also has a bunch of family friendly games. I know I sound like a paid spokesperson but I couldn't be happier with this console. From most of the reading, the poor reviews are really a result of slow shipping (likely their own fault for not choosing carefully) so be careful when reading reviews. As for Amazon, I buy A LOT from Amazon. Nearly every piece of electronics I own comes from them and given the A+++ customer service experience I've had I will never shop anywhere else.

5.0,True,"02 15, 2016",A25F6J9ATFBMH8,B0041RR0TW,G. W.,"First I want to point out that this gamepad uses a dongle when connecting to a PC (which is a good thing). I have had issues with several Bluetooth gamepads that are only Bluetooth for PC gaming. There is a strange issue with windows 7 and windows 10. At some point depending on how many times you install/uninstall the Bluetooth only gamepads windows will not install it correctly and the joysticks no longer function under windows. I have researched this extensively and contacted a maker of another gamepad and the only solution I found once this happens is to reinstall windows because once you do this they start to work again (not a practical solution). This is NOT an issue with this gamepad since it uses a dongle when hooking up to a PC. In fact it shows up in the control panel like a xbox 360 controller and even though the Bluetooth gamepad no longer installs correctly this one continues to work. So in short avoid the Bluetooth ones when that is the only method of using it with a PC. I would also recommend getting a copy of Pinnacle's Game Profiler which will also you to map the gamepad if needed with certain games.

This is a great PC gamepad. It is a little heavy but that is probably because of using regular batteries. I definitely would prefer to put up with some additional weight and have a device that will last longer because you can swap out the batteries yourself. An internal rechargeable battery will eventually fail to hold a charge and then you will not be able to use it wireless maybe corded (providing you can use it that way).

Build quality is great and here is one feature all the other makes of dongle using gamepads should include: dongle STORAGE. Which for this gamepad is in with the batteries. Thank you Logitech for thinking of dongle storage. It drives me crazy when you have a device that uses a dongle and which is large enough to have had a place made in the device to store the dongle and yet there is none.

So if you are looking for a PC gamepad that uses regular batteries and not an internal rechargeable battery I would recommend this one. It just depends on what you prefer; but as mentioned already all internal batteries fail eventually it is only a matter of time.",Highly recommend. 1.) uses regular batteries. 2.)

5.0,False,"09 28, 2010",A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,B002BSA20M,Scott and JC Chupack,"BACKGROUND:
I'm a female gamer in my thirties, married, no kids.  Though I've heard much about the Halo franchise, I'd never played a Halo game prior to this one.  I'm an avid first person shooter (FPS) gamer, with Left 4 Dead (L4D) and L4D2 as my games of choice.  I've tried COD4 and other Call of Duty games and found it to be overly complex with little to no value for the complexity to the end user.  Since I got offered the product via Vine, I decided to give Halo Reach a try.  Also, the cinematic commmercials drew me into the storyline in a way that hasn't been the case for me with previous Halo releases.  I am going to focus this review on the single player experience, though discussion of controls obviously applies to both.

BOX-TO-PLAY EXPERIENCE:
Though Halo does not explicitly incorporate a tutorial, the box-to-play experience is quite positive.  First, you choose colors and a logo for your character.  Defaults are chosen so you can skip through the customization quickly if you like.  However, if you customize your character, those customizations show up whenever the character is present in videos or cutscenes, which is a nice touch.  After customization, the game opens with an impressive video giving a brief introduction to Reach and your mission there.  Then, you are dropped into play.  While this may feel intimidating at first vs. some other games that start you in a tutorial area, Halo Reach walks you through actions as you move through each ""level"" of play.  Pop-up text guides you on button actions, and there are plenty of opportunities to familiarize yourself with controls before you're in the heat of battle.  I was able to jump into play without reading anything in the manual, though I later went back to the manual to better understand the game's backstory (more on this later).

CONTROLS/EASE OF USE:
Certainly, I'm sure if you've played a game in this franchise before, you'll jump right into this game.  But, for newbs like me, the controls are still very easy to use.  In the first instance of panning, the game prompts you to try panning and gives you an opportunity to make an inline change to inverted panning if you prefer that method.  I really liked that it prompted me to make the common tweaks in the game screen rather than forcing me to find a settings menu to change controls.  It also worked with my surround sound system immediately, versus some games I've played that require the player to configure surround sound and resolution in settings.

One problem I ran into was in controlling vehicles.  The driving was not familiar to me from any other game.  It seems like left stick controls acceleration and right stick controls steering. Worse yet, the manual does not help here at all.  The controller diagram does not explain how the controls change for driving.  The pop-up text did not clarify this.  It basically took me five or ten minutes of crashing into things to figure out how to drive with enough precision to avoid driving off cliffs or to execute evasive moves.  But, your first introduction to driving happens between action sequences, so you have time to experiment.

That was not the case with ammo.  Though the game taught how to shoot, how to throw grenades, and how to re-load, it was not apparent how to pick up more ammo and/or exchange guns.  I spent a good bit of one level just cowering behind a rock waiting for my computer-controlled teammates to kill off the aliens because I was out of ammo and had no idea how to get more.  I couldn't see ammo laying on the ground, and I wasn't yet aware that I could pilfer guns from teammates or dead aliens.  This was not covered in the manual adequately, either.  It's one of the few areas where it seems like they assumed you'd know this from previous Halo games rather than prompting you to do it pre-action so you'd learn the controls.

Crouching is also proving difficult.  Supposedly, per the manual, you tap the control stick once to crouch and tap again to stand back up...pretty standard for FPSs.  However, it seems like you actually have to hold down the control stick to stay crouched, which makes crouching basically unusable.  Since the manual says otherwise, this may just be a bug or controller issue.

These few difficulties represent the exceptions rather than the rule, though.  Most of the controls are surprisingly simple.

GAMEPLAY (SINGLE PLAYER):
Halo Reach does an excellent job of restoring you in a reasonable and smart way if you die as well as letting you initiate a save/quit at any point.  You are never trapped in a sequence for a long period of time, unable to leave without losing progress.  In Normal mode (the difficulty level set by default), you can withstand a fair amount of damage, perhaps even a little too much.  (Kamikaze gameplay often feels viable when it shouldn't.)  There's a nice balance of situations for sniping with normal move-and-shoot situations.  I did find it confusing sometimes as to whether I should be shooting at the aliens (pr ""coveys"") or their ships.  Your goal/objective is often communicated by your computer AI teammates, and the general noise and use of slang made it hard to understand what was expected. The ""goal"" screen was equally vague.  For example, an alien ship drops off fighters.  Would there be less fighters if I shot at the ship?  There's no way to know, and it feels like a waste of precious ammo.  But then again, on another level, I played for what felt like a long time before I realized that I needed to be shooting the ship rather than the individual aliens.  (It became more obvious when I stumbled onto a rocket launcher.)  Even with that, it's enjoyable to play the game.  There's plenty to shoot at, good cover to take, etc.  It hasn't felt overly hard or easy (in Normal mode).  The graphics are arresting in complexity and visual beauty.  I also appreciated the nice smattering of achievements.  They felt well-paced such that it was encouraging.

STORYLINE:
I came into this knowing nothing of the Halo storyline.  I still don't really understand it.  I feel like I'm probably missing some in-jokes or references in the cut scenes that are based on prior knowledge of the franchise; I won't mention them specifically in case they're spoilers.  I think 1-2 pages of the manual could have been spent on background for players that came to this game as their first Halo game.  It's still enjoyable without that context, but I do plan to go read up on fansites to try to understand what it is that I'm seeing from the characters.  The basic gist, as I understand it, is that this Reach planet is the last barrier between the alien Covenant and Earth, and we, the Spartans, have to defend it.  Really, that's all you need to know to get into the game.  Your character has some interesting backstory, but that is mostly unfolded as the game goes.  I can't praise enough that this game has frequent female characters, in roles that aren't simply ""damsel in distress.""  I like that your initial customization lets you choose male or female.  In both cases, the body types are exaggerated, but that is tolerable so you can see who is who under that armor.

OVERALL:
This game has sucked me in, and I find myself spending an hour or so with it on most evenings.  I'm intrigued and may go back to rent or buy previous Halo games.  It's good, clean, alien-shooting fun.  I've already recommended it to friends.  If you like FPS games at all, you'll enjoy this one.","Review from a FPS regular but Halo newbie:  approachable, enjoyable, great game",1285632000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So I might be slightly jaded at the high value of this game, since it cost me nothing to play.  But, this is 100% an uncharted game, not watered down in the least.  Voice acting is the same, cut scenes the same, there is nothing to discern this from a console experience. If you like the uncharted games on PS3, then you will enjoy this.  Graphically it takes a very small step down in crispness, but some things like the water in the canoe scene are the best I have ever seen in a game on any system.
Vita Controls: The tilt controls are tacked on and seem silly and repeptitive.  The touch screen add-ins are cute and do add a bit to the gameplay.  The game shocases lots of the vita features which is nice.
Replay Value:  If you like to go back and replay to find things, then it will keep you busy for a while.  I tend to stick to the main story, so for me there is very little replay value in games that don't include an online component, which this does not.

This game is free on playstation plus right now, if you know you won't replay it, buy a 3 month psplus membership and blast through it for about half price........that will up your gaming value i think quite a bit.  Sidenote: the download of this is about 3gb........so if you only have a 4gb card like me this tops you out if you download it, another reason I am finishing it and removing it.

Every single battle is different from the start, and if you lose and come back to the battle again, the game will give you a completely different setup, which is awesome. Basically, you roam the world, complete main and side quests, collect funds and resources, level-ups, and follow the story. It's all good clean fun.

The only criticism that I have is one that many already expressed: you are not able to tell the level rating and the enemy types of your enemy before you engage in a battle. This can often lead to a lob-sided catastrophe if you end up with an enemy who is far superior than you, or you did not equip your troops appropriately. If there is going to be a sequel, this would be the only request that I make: let us preview the battle and prepare for it in advance so we don't end up fighting an unwinnable battle, or having to retreat and get penalized for it by losing gold/jewels.

All in all, a great game for puzzler RPG fans!

It's amazing to me how a game that is, at its core, centered around the simple joys of running, jumping, exploring, and playing, can be so full of brilliance and inspiration. If it's not already obvious, my wife and I both absolutely love this masterpiece. This is a *huge* game full of ideas and concepts both new and nostalgic, and while I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum, this will be a long, detailed review. It's the only way to do such a wonderful game justice. Either jump ship now or continue reading, you've been warned.

The story in Super Mario 3D World is as simple as it is in any Mario game, but 3D World's story is noteworthy simply because Peach's kidnapping is not the plot device used to introduce the exquisite gameplay (it also shows Mario and Luigi actually fixing something as plumbers, something I cannot recall a main series Mario game showing before, so that's special :D).While going for an evening stroll, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Blue Toad stumble across a clear pipe, out of which pops a unique pixie-like princess from the Sprixie kingdom. She then informs them that Bowser has attacked and taken over her kingdom and requests help when, all of a sudden, Bowser pops out of the pipe, kidnaps this new princess, and absconds back into the recently conquered Sprixie Kingdom. Our four heroes give chase into the pipe to help their new friend, like any good Samaritans would do, thus beginning 3D World's platforming euphoria. Interspersed throughout the adventure are very simple cutscenes that are enjoyable and appealing.

The visuals in 3D World are exceptional. This is the first Mario outing in genuinely glorious HD, all at a smooth 60 fps, and it is beyond gorgeous. I've always loved the art design in Mario games. The focus on clean, imaginative style and vibrant color has always made Mario games stand out as some of the most beautiful releases on their platform, and 3D World is no exception. Impressive lighting effects and exceptionally well done textures make levels like Bowser's oceanside castle during a sunset, or sunny grasslands, or snowy wonderlands such beautiful, enchanting playgrounds to run and jump through. Character designs, whether friend or foe, are all very nostalgic and the new ones feel very fresh at the same time. Seeing classic enemies like Chargin Chuck from SMWorld is so nostalgic. The audio is equally charming, with many iconic sound effects returning. The real audio highlight, however, is the soundtrack. Anybody worried that this game would drop the beautiful orchestrations of the Galaxy games can rest easy. Whether the tracks are reminiscent of the symphonic majesty of the Galaxy soundtracks or more of the jazzy 3D Land variety, all songs in 3D World are super catchy and full of warm nostalgic magic, as befits a Mario game (even brand new songs immediately cultivated nostalgia in me). You'll be humming the tunes long after you turn off the game. From a visual and audio perspective, this game is a definite winner and a showcase for the Wii-U.

I've always loved the core concept behind Super Mario 3D Land/World: Take nostalgic gameplay concepts and goals from the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Bros-1-3/dp/B0049DYNNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Bros. 1-3</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-World/dp/B003XNU1M8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario World</a>, and play through them from Mario's perspective in a 3-D game with all the refinements and conventions 3-D Mario games have introduced over the years. It's a perfect marriage of classic conventions and creative innovation, made so that fans of every style of Mario can enjoy themselves. For example, each level has you going for the end-pole as your goal, just like the 2-D Mario classics. However, each level features three green stars (first seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-2/dp/B002BSA388/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy 2</a>) that encourages 3-D Mario style exploration of the levels in order to collect them, and the levels are so well designed and massive, you'll enjoy every second you spend exploring them. It's a marriage of two different Mario styles that compliment each other very well and offer something to every Mario fan. That's great. The world map may seem to be styled after the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Super-Mario-Bros/dp/B002BRZ9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Super Mario Bros.</a>&nbsp;games at first glance, except that you're given free rein to run all over the whole thing like some sort of 3-D playground overworld, another example of 3-D and 2-D Mario combining into something new and special, appealing to everybody.

The controls in this game have been refined to near perfection, to the point that characters on the screen feel like an extension of yourself. Like everything else in the game, they feel like a perfect marriage between classic and modern Mario styles. Like the classic 2-D Mario games, you can't double or triple jump, which is jarring at first but ultimately makes for unique, old-school gameplay that feels new for a 3-D Mario game. Using just the control stick has you move in a leisurely stroll pace. Holding down X/Y makes you run and if you keep running uninterrupted, the character breaks out into a fast sprint. The rolling spin and rolling long-jump (returning from 3D Land) are wonderful additions to Mario's acrobatic repertoire. Jumping and stomping on enemies has never felt more satisfying. What's awesome about all of this is that you get to choose between several equally well-designed characters to play as, and all offer unique abilities and traits. Mario is an all-around balanced character, Luigi's controls are more ""slippery"" and he jumps higher, Peach runs slower but can hover like in SMB2 which makes her good for beginners, and Blue Toad runs faster than the others but he drops faster after jumps. That's not all, as there is an unlockable character with their own unique abilities and gameplay style too! This is such a great aspect of 3D World. Having so many unique characters practically guarantees that gamers of any skill level or play style will get the most out of their experience with the game, and that's awesome. Bravo Nintendo! On the new side of things, you can knock shells off of Koopas and, in addition to throwing them as always, you can go inside and ride them as they slide along the floor. Talk about a blast! The new clear pipes introduce a ton of new gameplay possibilities that require good reflexes and strategy. So many new gameplay concepts, and all are super fun.

The suits that return from 3D Land (Tanooki, Fire, Boomerang Bros., propeller box, etc) all play extremely well and are super satisfying to use. New suits/items, such as the already-iconic Cat Suit or the new canon box fit in with the rest very well. The Cat Suit is ridiculously fun. Others are bizarrely appealing, like the double cherry, which creates a new clone of your character each time you grab one. Imagine the hilarious chaos that results from 10-12 fire balls bouncing around hurled from 5-6 Marios with fire suits. Boss fights that incorporate the double cherry are super fun too. There are many new items you can grab and carry along with you, like a baseball to throw at enemies, or potted Piranha plants that can rapidly eat enemies and other obstacles. Of course, these are just a few examples, and the game features many more.

The utterly brilliant level designs compliment the gameplay mechanics beautifully. There are so many new level ideas for a 3-D Mario game too, including but not limited to: riding a Loch Ness Yoshi monster named ""Plessie"" through a tropical paradise, a level exploring a Japanese-style castle, a light/shadow/silhouette themed sewer level that really messes with your perception of size and distance, a level based on the classic Super Mario Kart (complete with overwhelmingly nostalgic music), the Captain Toad puzzle levels, the mystery houses, the speed run levels, a golden express segment that makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Super-Mario-Bros-2/dp/B0088MVPFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a>&nbsp;look conservative by comparison... I could go on forever. Although a bit on the easy side, boss fights in the game overall are better than they were in 3D Land, full of variety and new ideas, although I still prefer the Bowser fights from 3D Land (3D Land's Bowser battles are among my favorite in the entire series). Seriously, this game is bursting with creativity. New concepts are introduced at a breathtaking speed. Much like Galaxy 1 & 2, Super Mario 3D World feels like standing before a seemingly bottomless well of brilliant new ideas. If it doesn't top Galaxy 1 or 2 in that respect, 3D World at least matches them. That alone is impressive, especially since the overall focus of 3D World is more ""conventional"" in comparison to the mind-bending Galaxy games. The fact that it is easily as big as the first Galaxy game makes this even more amazing. Once you beat the main worlds, several more pop up, and the farther you get into the game, the more challenge there is to be had. This game has a fantastic density of content.

Another aspect that makes Super Mario 3D World a milestone for the series is its excellent multiplayer. This is the first 3-D Mario game to implement multiplayer and it is incredible! I was worried this would have the lazy multiplayer of the NSMB games where all characters play the same and offer no real variety, but thankfully 3D World delivers the goods. Each player gets to control a unique character (no generic, recolored Toads for player 4, thankfully), and as I said earlier, each character controls uniquely as well, so everyone will have their own experience! It also never become frustrating like it does in the NSMB games, where other players too often become obstacles to your enjoyment rather than enhancing it. In 3D World, it's super fun and really hearkens back to the old days where playing video games with friends and loved ones on the couch was a bonding, joyful experience. Any game that my wife and I bond over always gets bonus points in my book, and 3D World is superb in that regard. The game is so well designed that you will get the most out of your time with the game, regardless of whether you're playing alone or with others. That's awesome. Bravo Nintendo!

You might wonder how 3DW functions as a Wii-U exclusive and what features there are. Well, for starters, the touch screen and mic are used in several, unique ways that affect the levels you play through, adding complexity to the mix. The gyroscope can be used to get different angles in the levels, which is really helpful for finding collectibles. There are so many other things you can do using the gamepad, it's easy to lose count. Personally, I find the gamepad a lot more useful with more complex series, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Zelda/dp/B00GR0IRGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Zelda</a>&nbsp;for example, but it works surprisingly well in 3D World. Miiverse is also utilized in the same fun way it was in NSMBU, but has been deepened with collectible stamps hidden in the levels that adds spice to messages. I like the Miiverse system here, it's a nice novelty at the very least. Overall, the Wii-U exclusive features don't feel like gimmicks, thankfully, and the game works well because of them and not in spite of them, which is all I ask for.

So, to all you who stuck around with this review, I really cannot emphasize it enough: this game is an absolute masterpiece. I really can't think of a single flaw or complaint to say about the game. Nintendo EAD has been on a roll for years with 3-D Mario releases, and with each new game, I always doubt and worry that they can't possibly top the game that came before it. With Super Mario 3D World, they have indeed continued their streak of top-tier quality. It may not have the brilliant gravity defying concept of the Galaxy games, but the sheer amount of creativity and innovation they poured into this game despite it being more ""conventional"" in its style just astounds me even more. The huge addition of well-executed multiplayer makes this a 3-D Mario milestone in yet another way. I bought this game at my local *cough cough* as soon as it opened and have been playing since then (alternating with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, another masterpiece). In addition to its awesome creativity, this is one of the most celebratory Mario games I've ever played too, filled with salutes and homages that pretty much every Mario fan can appreciate and enjoy to the fullest. So do I recommend it? Oh yeah, you better believe I do. This is the undisputed Wii-U ""killer app"" and is an absolutely essential game for any Wii-U library. I'd even say the game is worth buying the system over. Seriously, it is such a masterwork in game design. Buy it immediately, enjoy the game either solo or with others, and experience another magical masterpiece with Nintendo's famous plumber hero.",A wonderfully designed game that has something special for every kind of Mario fan,1458604800,25,,

My only problem with it is that the difficulty isn't consistent, with the bosses at times being incredibly hard, and the other enemies not being too difficult if you strategise effectively. It was a little shocking though, when I was killed in one of my first battles. I think that I went into a cave that I wasn't supposed to be in yet, and it was swarming with dozens of goblin-like creatures. Thankfully, after reloading I was able to run around and use traps and all of my bombs, to take them all out. After that, while there were difficult battles, other than the boss fights, they all seemed fair.

This game is huge, as the whole second act is completely different depending on your choice of who to side with, and the third act is probably different for everyone depending on other choices you make. I really wish that there was some kind of new game+ or you were able to go back to the second act and immediately play out the other side. I would have started the game over immediately, but I really hated going back to being the weak character I was at the beginning. Also, it's going to be great to eventually play through the game all over again in a year or so.

This game definitely has adult features, but it's nothing too crazy, and the graphics aren't great enough to be fascinated by the pixelated breasts. Still, the adult features of the story were very enjoyable, it didn't have to pull punches like a lot of video games. The only thing here, is that I saved Triss, and in the end my Witcher barely got a hug from her. This is part of the problem, while it was really cool where you could end the game with no final boss fight, or you could initiate the toughest fight of the game to get your revenge on the other Witcher that framed you for the death of the King. I didn't like how the ending really just turns into a cliffhanger. I'd love to know how everything turned out, but I'm probably going to have to wait a couple years before I find out. It'll also be very interesting to see how the next game takes your choices into consideration. I would guess that the third Witcher will take place after the war is over, and they can make everything you did before unimportant for the most part, except for a few moments they could craft for each player's different play-through.

So overall, I really loved this game and would recommend it to any adult RPG fan, and any action fan as well.",Excellent Game,1349222400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"04 28, 2009",A2MP7JGO747X6E,B001OALQIA,Nightmare,"I'm a big fan of classic RPGs, having played Bard's Tale like mad on the PC around 15 years ago.  It featured a variety of classes, different spells, stats, secrets, and very little guidance.  One feature that tells you it's classic is that Armor Class (defense) actually gets better as it DECREASES and goes into the negatives.  The Dark Spire features all of this and more.

To start off, you choose four characters to make up your team.  You can decide their name, race (dwarves, elves, halflings, humans), class, spells (if they use magic), and alignment (lawful or chaotic).  Everything makes a difference in this game, however slight.

Now you enter the Dark Spire itself to begin your adventure.  Navigation in this game is like old RPGs and Etrian Odyssey in that you are constantly walking through hallways from a first-person perspective, moving one square at a time.  You encounter random battles which range from one enemy to multiple groups of enemies.  The challenge level is pretty steep, requiring patience, lots of healing, and grinding.

Experience points are used to upgrade your class level, skills, or stats.  Anything you raise costs a lot, so you need to be careful and think ahead before you spend your experience.

There's a variety of different equipment available in The Dark Spire--swords, helms, armor, shields, and accessories.  Weapons and armor can add special options to your attack and defend commands while in battle.  For example, a Longsword offers a precision attack for increased accuracy but takes longer to perform.  It also offers a lunge attack for doing extra damage at the expense of defense for that turn.  This adds lots of variety to each battle, and it makes equipment choice very important.

Of course you can choose between classic and modern graphics in this game.  Classic is literally composed of straight white lines against a black background, except for character sprites which have a little color and detail.  It's as bare-bones as it can get.  Personally, I enjoy it and find myself playing in Classic mode periodically.  There's something about the retro feel that really interests me and adds some spark to the experience.

The music is odd, but enjoyable at the same time.  I really don't know how to describe it, so all I can say is that it ranges from mellow to upbeat.  The controls are great, but the menus (especially in the guild where you make and format your team, as well as spend experience points) can take a little bit getting used to.  I'm pretty comfortable with them now, but at first they had me lost.

Overall, this game is amazing.  It's definitely not for everybody, though.  Those who like classic RPGs, enjoy difficult games, and liked Etrian Odyssey will probably like this game.  Otherwise, you might want to avoid it.  It's hard core Role-Playing, and its not taking any prisoners.",Retro is good!,1240876800,10,,

I remember when I first bought this game ""gold cartridge"" style with the cool heart/key icons.  And I still find myself revisiting this very same classic at least once a year.  The Legend Of Zelda was the gold standard of adventure series that became a monster franchise, producing several sequels for the NES, Game Boy Color, Super NES, Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii/Wii U and Nintendo DS.

For anyone that hasn't played this awesome 1987 original, I will explain in great detail about how to begin your quest.  Go inside the cave and get your wooden sword so that your green-clothed hero, Link, can destroy the several enemies whom he will encounter:  ex. Octoroks, Tektites, Peahats, Leevers, Lynels, Stalfos, etc.  The Legend Of Zelda takes place in both the Overworld and 9 Underworld dungeons.

Link will need to find several treasures/items along the way to help him throughout his quest, plus collect 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom before he can tackle his arch-nemesis, the evil wizard Ganon!  He starts with 3 Life Hearts, and he can collect more after defeating each boss in the 8 underworld dungeons (you can find 5 additional Heart Containers throughout the Overworld).

First, and foremost, Link should go to Level 1 (about 6 spaces above your original starting point).  He will find 2 useful items:  the Wooden Boomerang and the Bow (however, you can't use the Bow until you purchase arrows for 80 Rupees, and the Wooden Boomerang can later be upgraded to the Blue Boomerang in Level 3).  Along the way, you can also collect Bombs from the Goriyas which you can later use to blast secret doors or kill foes (you'll need bombs to take down the Dodongo on Level 2).

After passing Level 2, Link will need to explore more of the Overworld in order to collect other important items:  the Blue Candle (can later be upgraded to the Red Candle in Level 7), the Blue Ring (it costs a whopping 250 Rupees, but it'll allow Link to take half damage from all enemies, and can further be upgraded to the Red Ring in Level 9), the Food (you'll need it to get past the Goriya in Level 7), the Blue Map (you need to show it to the Old Lady to buy some Medicine), the Big Shield (can ward off bigger attacks but not from all bosses), and the Magical Bracelet (you need it to more rocks).

Throughout the rest of the underworld dungeons, you will eventually acquire the Raft, Ladder, Magical Whistle (you'll need it to defeat the Digdogger in Level 5 and later open up World 7), Magical Wand, and the Book of Magic.  Finally, Link can upgrade his wooden sword to both the White Sword (requires 5 Life Hearts) and the Master Sword (requires 11 life hearts, and you need both the Master Sword and Silver Arrow to kill Ganon).  When you finally DO face Ganon, keep striking with your sword (unfortunately, you won't be able to see him while he shoots at you!) 4 times; after the 4th and final hit, use the Silver Arrow to defeat him!!  :)

Once you've beaten the game, it's still not over yet!  You'll have to tackle an even HARDER second quest in the game (yet, it's still very satisfying).  All of the items and Underworld dungeons will be placed in different areas, and other challenges will await Link (ex:  you'll have to give up one Life Heart or 50 Rupees to pass through certain areas in one of the Underworld Dungeons; in other Dungeons, Link will need to walk through walls).

I would strongly recommend ordering The Legend Of Zelda:  Collector's Edition Player's Guide from Amazon which will cover both Zelda 1 & 2 for the NES, plus Ocarina of Time/Majora's Mask for the Nintendo 64.

Now some Flaws that May not be flaws soon:

It is not typical sports game where you unbox it and go online .First you need to unlock/buy moves of your fighter that you create and improve your fighter, assign skill points to stamina and health only then you can compete and win against other opponents on line and its great feature as it keep you motivative .Don`t be a judge just after playing one game ,give it a chance you`ll love it eventually.

You need two controller NOT one and Move controller are in shortage ( as time of typing ) like this game ( Drove 30 miles to get my copy ).If you`ve old SD screen TV.You can barely read text or direction.i needed to watch a training video on you tube to make sure what they wanted me to do.

Danny Trejo ( Machete)is your trainer with real video .No animation for him until he fights you .Many training sessions are without much guideline .Training session aren`t free so you pay for `em with in-game-cash money but session starts and ends abruptly and make you wonder why i did poorly in practice. Developers needed to explain `em in bit more detail.

Its not arcade game but real deep engine. Physically i found loop hole (if i press T + Move and tilt it backward and then thrush forward my Fighters hits like crazy ..wii trick )so still there are few tricks to find a way without physically going crazy on move. When you press move button on controller fighter close in distance, if kept pressed , so close that you even can`t throw punches freely so keep distance by moving controller backward otherwise you `ll be gassed out without hurting your opponent with force .Why no colors in game looks almost black and white or may be sony wants us to feel like we are in dungeon.

 still this game is great and must buy if you are into fighting game but you can`t be couch potato while playing this .Now wii is grand daddy of motion controllers and like all grand daddies are weak .PS move is young ,enthusiastic and wild and expect same from you.your arms gonna hurt in beginning but keep it up and you can`t skip a day without it .",Flaws but Flawless,1289865600,3,,

5.0,True,"09 27, 2011",A1QWYAWB1DRSQF,B001E27DLM,C. Petit,"This is probably the most addicting RPG for the DS since Final Fantasy IV.  The main plot starts when Chrono goes to the Millennial Fair in 1000 AD.  While there, he runs into an adventurous girl named Marle.  After exploring the Fair for awhile, they go to look at a demonstration of Chrono's friend Lucca's latest invention --- a teleporter.  When Marle volunteers to go through it, her pendant reacts strangely and she disappears.  So begins an epic journey that spans millions of years.

At one point, a main plot twist happens I've never seen an RPG do before.  My mouth hit the floor when it happened.

Game play wise, this is a classic RPG --- your characters gain in strength, experience and money as they defeat monsters in combat.  Improved equipment offers better attack and defense.  In addition, all characters learn unique Techniques --- some are healing magic, some attack the enemy and some protect the party.  There are many Techniques that are only performed by specific sets of characters, adding variety and a strategic aspect to gameplay, since you can have a maximum of 3 characters in your party at once (but a maximum of 7 may exist).

A hint:  getting one of the characters up to level 96 gives her the most powerful single attack in the game.  She doesn't even need equipment to do it (her not needing equipment for her attacks makes her EXTREMELY helpful at one point in the game).

Fortunately, characters not in the active party also receive some experience even if they are not in play at the moment---this helps ensure the characters stay somewhat close in their levels.

In terms of replayability, once you win the game (and see one of 14 possible endings), you can create a New Game Plus ---where you keep all of your characters' levels, Techniques, equipment and most of your inventory.  In fact, this is the only way to see most of the endings, and is a nice way to experience the story without needing to level grind.

Also, there is a very large array of side quests which provide the best equipment in the game, including Dimensional Portals in a New Game Plus (these Portals significantly upgrade 3 of your characters, and defeating all 3 opens up a special, extremely difficult optional boss battle).

Finally, there is an Arena where you can manage a small monster and send it into battle against other monsters --- with interesting prizes dropped from it.  The Arena works well as a break from the main game, since the monster is part of a normal save file.

Overall, the game offers a ton of value for the money.  I still enjoy replaying it after having had it for 6 months.",An amazing RPG for the DS,1317081600,3,,

Sadly, the 3DS version, the one I opted to go with as the prequel was on the prior system, is weighed down by a save corruption bug. In a few specific areas of the game, there is a probability of your game corrupting when saving and due to the large footprint of the game there is only one save slot.

Most annoyingly, this bug existed in the Japanese version, it was never patched... cruddy, but given the nature of Nintendo's online structure and rarity of patches, not unforgivable. However, Aksys picked this up, knowing that it had the bug, and brought it over completely intact never breathing a word of it. They have yet to respond to any concerns about it either, which most definitely lowers my opinion of them.

Checking online, Rising Star Games, the company who published the European edition actually came out and said that they tested it throughly and could not reproduce a bug... which turned out to be total B.S.... What is wrong with the publishers of this game? Absolutely ridiculous, Nintendo should honestly revoke their license to produce and distribute the game until this is cleared up.

If you plan on picking this game up, know two things.

1.) If you have a Vita, there are no bugs in that version and it has a few other legs up (multiple save slots, better visuals, better sound)

2.) If you're playing on the 3DS, DO NOT save in any puzzle rooms. Even if you're in the novel section of the game, try to restrict your saves to the warehouses and hallways.

I've seen some people reccommend that you simply don't save and just keep the system in sleep mode between plays, this is not a good idea, this game is fairly crash prone in a few spots. I revised my review, because I wanted to get across the quality of the actual game, but just know what you're getting into here.",Amazing game; but beware of it's fatal bug.,1351987200,60,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

They succeeded! this game has often been considered to be as odd as Super Mario Brothers 2 was at the time but this one felt more like the original Super Mario Brothers games.

Here Luigi is not required for this is Mario's solo adventure! In this game you are not in the Mushroom kingdom or the dream world of Subcon, instead you are in a weird place called Sarasaland where a new princess named Daisy was kidnapped by an alien named Tatanga. Here in this game you do 12 levels in 4 worlds as you fight goombas, Koopas with bombs instead of shells, Chinese ghosts, Moai statue heads that attack and more bizarre stuff.

It's a fresh and different Mario adventure just like the last year's Super Mario Bros. 2 game only more true to the original Super Mario Bros. formula of the first game. What's cool in this game you get a special flower that grants you a special ball that defeats enemies and collects coins for you, there's also different enemies to fight such as killer Sphinxes to giant Sea-Horses as in 2 levels it can become a sidescroller where your in a Sub or plane blasting enemies including bosses which makes this a worthwhile Mario game.

The graphics are simplistic yet primitive and small for the gameboy but works well on Super GameBoy for the SNES.

I had previously owned the first and second in the series, but they had long since been ""borrowed"" and not returned.  Since we ordered the PS3 Metal Gear Solid Pack I decided this would be a good buy.

First of all, the games come in a small cardboard case to hold the 3 ps2 game cases.  Even though MS1 is a PS1 game, it is in a PS2 style case so that they can all stay together in the box.  This means that the artwork is different than on the originals of each of these games.  I personally don't care but just in case you do - now you've been told.

Each game comes with it's own manual as well as the ingame help we are all used to for the first couple of scenes.  This is an excellent collection for the price, and I would highly advise the purchase if you like this type of game.

The only negatives I have are
1) the game controls take a while to get used to
2) The PS1 game of MGS1 will NOT play in either of our PS2's.  Our PS3 should arrive soon so hopefully it will play in that since that was my favorite of the games anyway.  I am told that this is a fairly common problem, however my PS2's will play all of our other PS1 games without incident. I am told that this can be fixed by placing ""Tape"" on the top of the CD however I have yet to attempt this experiment.

Arcade Treasures 2 is a true sequel, in a sense, in that most of the games are from the late 80's and early 90's.  There are a few exception to this, such as Wizard of Wor and Timber.  Anyway, these later games are typically more complex and HARDER than the games on the first collection.  This is a good thing, because it will likely take you awhile to master them.  Which makes this disc not only a fun-filled blast of nostalgia, but ensures re-playability for quite some time.  And that's why I find myself rating Volume 2 higher than the first.  Sure, the previous disc arguably has more true ""classic"" titles.  But I think I'll be spending more time with this one.

Favorite games: Mortal Kombat 2 & 3 (now if only I could remember how to do all those fatalities...); NARC (best 2-player co-op action game ever); Wizard of Wor (for the funky early-80's speech synthesis); Total Carnage (truth in advertising...this game could cause a freakin' panic attack); Timber (I admit, I wasn't familiar with this one, but it's really charming and fun).

And now that it's 3DS e-Shop re-release is available on Club Nintendo for only 100 coins (If you don't know about Club Nintendo, I suggest you join and see what it's about. It's a great service), I was able to go and nab this classic at ease.

So, Kirby is known as a pink blob that sucks things up and copies enemy abilities, right? Well, here, since it IS the first Kirby game, you don't get to obtain enemy powers whatsoever. You'll be happy to know, however, that it doesn't affect the platforming experience badly at all. In fact, Kirby's Dream Land as a whole is spectacular.

The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen on a Game Boy game, and the music is very upbeat and fun to listen to. To top it all off, the gameplay is thrilling. It's unlike what you've dealt with in other Nintendo classics like Mario. Not only do you run and jump, but you can eat enemies, and spit them out at others! Oh, and you can fly! There are also some cool gimmicks, like shooting fire after collecting SuperSpicey Curry for a short period of time, and being able to fly and shoot out puff clouds during one of the bosses, in a similar fashion to shooters like Gradius.

The only issue with this game is that it is pretty short. There are only 5 levels, with the 5th level being composed of bosses that you've previously fought, as well as King Dedede, the final boss. But just because a game is short doesn't mean it's bad. And this game is excellent.

Unlike Kirby 64 and Kirby's Dream Land 3, this game is not totally easy, as there's surprisingly a bit of challenge here. Plus, the music sounds best here.

Anyways, if you happen to own a Game Boy, a GB Color, or a GB Advance, this is definitely one game to play.

The characters are at their most photorealistic and the environments are unbelievably pristine and gorgeous in 1080p. All of my favorite UC gameplay elements are back and, in most cases, improved.

In my opinion, only Naughty Dog can deliver a finisher like this...leaving the entire UC arc wrapped up with a neat little bow, and still have me wanting more.

Like the TV show there's profanity and dark, surreal, and discriminatory humor. Instead of a wide variety of jokes (some hit-and-miss IMO) present in the South Park:The Stick of Truth; this game has a heavy focuses on fart jokes and cultural identity/race; so if you get easily offended by this then this may not be the game for you. Even the difficulty select screen has a dark racial social commentary to it.

You still play a silent protagonists, even though it directly picks off from the first game (won't spoil the ending). What's starts off as finding a missing cat, and which group of kids will dominate in making the best super hero franchise turns into something bigger that effects the whole town. Plus there's some plot twist of sorts along the way. The title is obviously a play on words if you haven't noticed, and will not click until the final act of the game

Graphics for the most part is the same from the first game, with exception of maybe more detail in the costumes and overall texture. Game does run at a solid 60fps now.

Gameplay:
You start off with 3 classes with a wide variety of super powers to choose from. This will eventually expand to more classes and abilities where you can mix-and-match

Combat is a grid based system this time around (instead of 2-sided turn based system) having some attacks, buffs and debuffs (status effects) covering a certain area of the grid. Positioning is key as some moves may have knock back features attach to them or AOE damage

There's an upgrade tree that expands once you level up. Instead of selecting individual attributes via what you wear*, you have to equip items you find or buy (in game currency) as you progress through the game.

Wearables are purely cosmetic and does not influence your stats in-game

There's also a crafting system where you combine undesirable items to better ones to use as in-game health/revives or artifacts to attach to your upgrade tree

Simply based on the demo, this game is spectacular.  Even the way they kept the old school grey and black suit mixed with the newer body armor design.  The graphics are great and the fighting system is so enjoyable.  The fighting is both simple and complex at the same time.  You have 1 button for attack, 1 for counter, 1 for jump and 1 for using your cape to distract your enemy.  The combat system is freeflow so Batman reacts differently each time you use the attack or counter button.  Because of this, Batman can easily take on half a dozen guys at one time.  This is where the simplicity comes in, you can easily take them out by buttom mashing, but the fun is in the timing to perform a string on combos and counters and the right time.

The fighting system is only part of the fun.  Using your grappling gun and batarang are equally, if not more fun.  You can easily grapple up to a roof or gargoyle to gain a better view of the room.  Batman can also switch to predator/detective mode using his mask.  In this mode, Batman can see through walls to monitor enemies or even find structural weaknesses or an escape route.  Once you've scoped out the area you can begin picking the bad guys off one at a time.  There's nothing much better than gliding down from above to glide kick someone in the face or hang one of Joker's goons upside down from a gargoyle.  The AI is also impressive in this game.  For example, as you stealthily take down guys in a room the remaining enemies will grow more nervous as they find the uncontious bodies of their comrades.  This usually results in them shooting nervously at any sound they hear which makes them easily distracted.  Also, each play through, the enemies' placement, patrol pattern and reactions are different, this also makes the replay value more fun.

Again, all of this just based on the 10-15 minute demo and doesn't even include all of the unlocked techniques and accessories.  I cannot wait to play this game in it's entirety and I highly recommend it to any Batman/Superhero fan...better yet, if you just simply like video games, this a great one.",Best Hero Game Ever!!,1251158400,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I specifically bought an Xbox 360 for FM3, because GT5 got boring fast.  FM3 was a game for car enthusiasts.  The physics weren't as good as GT5, but they were certainly good enough. Overall, the game was much more fun than GT5.

Well, FM4 is better than FM3 in every way!  Better graphics, better physics, and more online competitions like ""Rivals"" mode. The real reason to buy this game, though, is for the car list. There are just so many worth additions to your garage.  You'll even be able to download new cars as they become available over the coming months.  Yes, that will cost extra money, but you don't have to buy it if you don't want to.

If there is one complaint I have, it's that you can't create your own race with custom settings in single player.  You pretty much have to go through the list of preexisting races, which are too short in my opinion.

You start out as a kid who visits your grandpop's farm. There you ride horses, get chased by chickens and sit on the mountain with this girl who is said to be the girl of your dreams. You sit on the mountain and you sing this very annoying ""Na Na Na Na"" song for the rest of the day. When you have to leave, you don't want to and you promise the girl you will see her again.

 You come back to the farm and it is all messed up because your grandpop hasn't take care of it. So, the mayor is giving you three years to fix up the farm or else you will be kicked out. This is not a simple ntask. You must do a lot of things before you can keep the farm.

 The things are countless. You run your farm by operating all different parts, from your house to your chicken coop to your stable. Your house serves as a encyclopedia for the weather forecast the next day, and tutorials to the game. With your house, you can upgrade it, expand it and make it a ranch mansion.

 The great feature is the cooking. You buy utensils, find different ingrediants, (like maybe cheese fondue and apples), mix it together and wallah, you got yourself a home-made meal.

 Like on a farm, you can harvest food. I don't mean just food. Depending on what season, you can harvest crops like cucumbers, turnips and watermelon, sell it and make a profit. It's just like a real farm. Thats just one of the great things you can do.

 Aaah... Livestock. You get a dog and you must care for it everyday. Not just getting a dog, you get a horse that you must care for everyday, chicken to lay eggs, which you can also make a profit, milk profit and cheese from cows and even sheep where you shave its wool with a sickle for profit. Think of a farm in a videogame.

 The village consists of many characters who you can interact with. You can hang on a beach, fish off a dock, read in a library, heh, even go to chuch to mourn a dead animal (or person). Again, the possibilities are countless.

 Just like real life, you can't go planting non-stop. You get tired, so don't expect to be planting. If you plant too long, you will end up in the hospital and half the day will be wasted, wasting a lot of profit.

 As in real life, seasons affect your crops. Summer is the best harvesting season, and winter is the boring time where you go mining. Speaking of that, you can mine for bronze, gold, silver and platinum. Even this blue ore is worth every penny. This game just keeps going on.

 Now, the best part. You can get married and pursue a love life. You pick your wife out of 5 girls and you give them presents they like (or dislike) and try to get there love. But you aren't the only one in the race. Yoiur rivals, as they call them, try to get the girl as well. Life. After you get married, you can have a kid and can raise them from scratch. You and your wife (who really does nothing), take care of it by feeding things it wants. It's A Wonderful Life!

 The controls and graphics. The controls are a little confusing, where you can only walk in a diagonal direction. The graphics were great for 2000, but they are way overmatched by '04 graphics.
